Located six hours north of Adelaide, South Australia, the area is a landscape that anyone but a geologist would describe as barren: crumbling, iron-stained earth, scrubby vegetation and a summer heat that melts the asphalt. The strange fossil he discovered was shaped like a pancake and ribbed like a palm frond—an imprint of some long-ago creature laid down in the sand. Sprigg didn’t know it then, but he’d just discovered what was—at that time—the earliest fossil evidence of complex, multicellular animal life on Earth. The landscape of low hills surrounding his find would later lend its name to a newly discovered geologic period—the Ediacaran—and the fossils within would prove an inflection point in our understanding of how life evolved on our planet. Today, the site is known as Nilpena Ediacara National Park. In 2020, with the assistance of The Nature Conservancy, the South Australian government acquired a vast swath of the area from its previous private landowner. The park protects not only the area’s fossil treasures but also threatened woodland habitats, endangered wildlife and Aboriginal cultural heritage sites. It’s a place where the biodiversity of the past and present meet, where kangaroos and bearded dragons sun themselves atop fossils of their earliest ancestors. “This place captures the dawn of animal life—the initial diversification of animals, of things that move and reproduce in different ways,” says Mary Droser, a paleontologist at the University of California Riverside who has studied fossils at Nilpena for more than 20 years. “It’s an extraordinary place, and it doesn’t matter that the organisms are half a billion years old.” Droser explains that, for a portion of the Ediacaran Period between 635 to 541 million years ago, this section of Australian outback was shallow sea, where Earth’s earliest animals scuttled across a mat of organic scum that built up on the ocean floor. Occasionally, a storm would blow over the sea, washing in sediments that would settle to deposit a layer of fresh sand and smother many creatures in place. For paleontologists, that layering of microbial mat and fresh sand is what makes Nilpena such an extraordinary fossil site. “The organic mat works as a separator between the storms, like when you buy steaks and there’s that paper between them that makes it easy to pull apart,” says Droser. “We’ve excavated these beds, turned them over and reconstructed large swaths of seafloor that are literal snapshots of the Ediacaran Sea.” Droser and her team have discovered more than a dozen new genera in Nilpena’s rocks. Over the years, Nilpena has revealed the raisin-shaped Attenborites (named for Sir David Attenborough) and Obamus coronatus, a small, round fossil that looks like a braided pastry and is named for the former U.S. president. “A lot of our discoveries happen because we’re on our hands and knees and we’re like, ‘What the heck is this?’” Nilpena is one of a handful of prolific Ediacaran sites in the world, and the only one where paleontologists have excavated whole beds. That allows Droser to reconstruct the lost ecosystem and investigate a host of questions that paleontologists are rarely able to study, particularly how these early life-forms may have interacted with one another. To help answer those questions, the paleontologists use a combination of mapping and imagery techniques, including laser scanning and photogrammetry, to digitize the fossil seafloor. They take the data with them for further study in California, leaving the fossils where they found them. “We can ask very different questions and get a really deep insight at Nilpena,” says Droser. “We have the oldest bilaterian [in the research record],” she says, referring to the symmetrical body plan shared by essentially all modern animal life, except corals and sponges. Within these rocks, they’ve found the earliest evidence of animal mobility, scavenging behavior and even sexual reproduction—finds that are contributing to what scientists know about the history of life on Earth. Perhaps almost as wondrous is that these fossils have survived all this time. For more than 150 years, Nilpena has been the site of working sheep and cattle stations (the term for a ranch in Australia). But its most recent owners, Ross and Jane Fargher, appreciated the land’s biological and paleontological heritage and took care not to overgraze their lands.  In an interview with Science, Ross Fargher said that he first noticed some unusual rocks on his property in the mid-1980s, when a visitor pointed out the wavelike ripple rock that made up the floor of his 100-year-old woolshed. Soon, paleontologists and looters were carting loads of rock back to Adelaide. “Alarm bells started to go off,” he told Science, describing how sites in both Nilpena and the Ediacara Hills were “pretty well stripped bare.” Fargher agreed to allow research on his property, but only if scientists left the fossils where they found them, keeping Nilpena’s rich paleontological heritage in place.  In January 2020, TNC helped the South Australian government purchase almost 150,000 acres of the 211,000-acre Nilpena Station with funding provided by The Wyss Foundation, a campaign of the Swiss philanthropist Hansjörg Wyss. The new Nilpena Ediacara National Park, which opened to the public in April 2023, protects the site’s extraordinary fossils while also adding critical ecosystems to the country’s collection of protected areas—a step toward hitting the country’s conservation targets.  Australia committed to following the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, an international agreement to reverse the loss of wildlife and habitat. A key part of the agreement is the “30x30” target, which asks nations to conserve at least 30% of their lands and oceans by 2030. Australia currently has about 22% of its land under protection, says James Fitzsimons, the senior advisor to global protection strategies for TNC. But, he says, 29 of the country’s 89 bioregions have less than 10% of their area protected. “A key element of 30x30 is ensuring the protected-area network is ‘ecologically representative,’” says Fitzsimons. “That means ensuring the full range of ecosystems and habitat types are included and emphasizing areas of particular importance for biodiversity.” The creation of this national park boosts protection for Australia’s Gawler bioregion, which has vast salt lakes, spinifex grasslands, and rocky hills and plains interspersed with arid woodlands. The park also protects cultural heritage sites of the Adnyamathanha people, the Traditional Owners of the land who camped near permanent springs, leaving behind ash and charcoal middens that can still be seen thousands of years later. The South Australian government is partnering with the Adnyamathanha to help protect heritage sites and incorporate traditional ecological knowledge into park management. Nilpena was the first of several land purchases facilitated by TNC in Australia in recent years. Other recent deals have protected savannah woodlands on Cape York Peninsula and nationally significant wetlands in New South Wales. A key part of TNC’s protection strategy in Australia, says Fitzsimons, is the organization’s flexibility. Rather than purchasing the land outright, TNC works with nonprofit organizations, Indigenous groups and state governments to create new protected areas under a variety of different mechanisms. To date, the organization has assisted in the protection of around 50 million acres—a collective area roughly the size of South Dakota or Nebraska. For Nilpena, now one year into becoming a national park, the efforts to conserve the area have just begun. The land sits within the Flinders Ranges region—home to the most renowned mountain range in South Australia—which is currently being considered for UNESCO World Heritage status. The mountains, about 45 minutes due east of the new park, are one of Australia’s iconic landscapes and home to vulnerable species like the yellow-footed rock-wallaby and western quoll. “Creating the Nilpena Ediacara National Park means we can manage the fossil sites to ensure security and management regimes are put in place, while providing for controlled visitor access and ongoing research,” says Irving.  “This will enable the potential World Heritage values to be protected in perpetuity and shared with the world.” Droser and her team still return to Nilpena each year, crawling across the ancient seafloor to map each and every blob or squiggle on the sandstone. “People ask me, ‘Why is this place important?’ It’s about understanding that the Earth has a history, and that there are organisms that went extinct because of past environmental change,” she says. “It’s because we have to understand the fate of past life on Earth to better understand our future.”"," “This place captures the dawn of animal life—the initial diversification of animals, of things that move and reproduce in different ways,” says Mary Droser, a paleontologist at the University of California Riverside who has studied fossils at Nilpena for more than 20 years. “It’s an extraordinary place, and it doesn’t matter that the organisms are half a billion years old.” Droser explains that, for a portion of the Ediacaran Period between 635 to 541 million years ago, this section of Australian outback was shallow sea, where Earth’s earliest animals scuttled across a mat of organic scum that built up on the ocean floor. “The organic mat works as a separator between the storms, like when you buy steaks and there’s that paper between them that makes it easy to pull apart,” says Droser."

They learned how to grow mushrooms and how to make creams and salves. In one-on-one consultations, attendees learned about applying for grants for their agriculture businesses. That evening, participants gathered around a bonfire at a nearby farm and ate soup made from the plants grown in the area. The event, in its fourth year, was hosted by an Ohio-based organization called the Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) Food and Farming Network. Launched in 2021, it’s a community-driven network of area growers, as well as those interested in food justice and food policy, joining together for support—one of many grassroots efforts around the country. River Johnson was born into a military family. When she was 12 years old, her family moved to Mad River Township, outside of Dayton. It was there that Johnson developed an appreciation for nature, roaming the countryside near her home as a child. She recalls that her family was one of the first Black families to integrate the community. “I remember moving there and being confronted with racism,” Johnson says. “When we moved there, they actually shot out our window.” In the face of that racism, Johnson’s family stayed in the community, and her mother grew a vegetable garden, not so much because she loved to garden, but because she loved to cook. Johnson herself worked in the corporate sector before finding her calling in working with the earth. While getting her master’s degree at Antioch University Midwest, she studied different types of food systems, such as market gardens, permaculture, and those using biodynamic frameworks and organic farming methods. “I started working with several community gardens and community centers, helping to establish perma-culture gardening, Indigenous gardening methods, and teaching and doing little workshops,” Johnson says. BIPOC farmers in particular, she says, face a lack of money and safety, making it challenging to grow in the regenerative farming space. Today Johnson is developing a garden in a historically underserved community in West Dayton. There, she grows primarily native plants, trees and shrubs. She uses gourds she grows as canvases to paint on. And she collects seeds from and propagates more than 20 species of native plants—the beginnings of her dream of a future native plant nursery. “I want to have my business there,” Johnson says. “I want it to be a demonstration of what a pollinator garden looks like, what wildlife habitat looks like, and what a regenerative household can look like in an urban environment.” Patty Allen’s connection to farming and advocacy goes back several generations. Allen, the program manager of the BIPOC Food and Farming Network, grew up in Dayton, about 230 miles from an all-Black farming settlement called Stringtown. In the 1860s, her great, great, great grandparents were part of a group of four or five families that co-founded Stringtown in Champaign County, Illinois. By 1905, other Black farmers and businessmen had created a “colored business cooperative,” focused on selling groceries. Allen remembers receiving her first garden plot when she was about 10 years old, launching a lifelong interest in growing food and, later, food justice. She took a break from a career in journalism and public relations to travel to Europe, where she learned about organic farming in Oxfordshire, England. In 2018, she took a farm apprenticeship in Brewster, New York, where she worked hands on raising goats, chickens and vegetable crops alongside a group of nuns. “I wanted to do something that was growing, nurturing, making a difference in the world,” Allen says. In 2022 she returned to Ohio to run what was then known as the BIPOC Farming Network as a program under a local environmental organization called Agraria Center for Regenerative Practice. When that organization developed financial issues in 2023, she took the program independent, determined that it should continue, and later changed the name to reflect its broader mission. Today the BIPOC Food and Farming Network is supported by grants from several organizations, including Hall Hunger Initiative, The Nature Conservancy, Central State University Extension, the Sustainable Agricultural Research and Education program, and its key sponsor, The 365 Project—a local community organization that promotes African American heritage, Black culture and racial equity. Among its initiatives is an annual Black farming conference as well as regular meetings on farming topics and events attended by alumni of a former fellowship program under Agraria that was focused on regenerative farming. In 2023 the group launched a policy fellowship designed to educate farmers about agricultural laws and policies at the local, state and federal levels. “I never knew I could be a farmer,” says Sharifa Tomlinson. Born in 1960 and raised by two schoolteachers in Massachusetts, Tomlinson never saw agriculture as an option. “At that time, at my age, Black women—we could be nurses, we could be teachers, we could be social workers. If we were really good, we could be doctors, lawyers. No one ever said there were other things, too.” Today, she describes herself as a “woods womyn,” as well as a registered nurse, doula and community educator. She helped run the 2023 Black Farming Conference after previously participating in the Regenerative Farmer Fellowship, where she learned regenerative agriculture techniques. In 2017, Tomlinson founded a 12-acre urban sanctuary near Dayton that she calls ARROWROCK FARM, becoming a full-time farmer in 2023. She’s building it into a cooperative urban market for farmers of color and a demonstration farm, complete with housing for those learning about regenerative farming on the property. She recently expanded her poultry farming operations, rapidly growing from 30 chickens to 1,000. She sells her produce and butchered chickens to an Ohio program that distributes them to food banks and pantries. “That’s a big deal to me. I’m able to give out sustainable food that’s locally sourced,” Tomlinson says. “It’s right from here, and it’s going to our community in the Miami Valley.” Tomlinson wants to encourage people in her generation to grow wealth generationally—through passing land to family, or to fellow BIPOC growers—“to make sure that people in my generation know to attempt to leave their land to people in the future generation that will keep on farming it. “If you are a farmer now, or if you have land acreage and want to do something with it, don’t always look at your family,” she says. “Yes, give something to your family, but look at other BIPOC farmers that might want to carry that legacy on, even if they don’t carry your name.” Gregory Muhammad grew up gardening. “My father used to always have a garden in our yard,” says Muhammad, who was raised in Dayton. “And I always planted something myself, even growing up, at five, six, seven—I don’t know how old [I was when] I started.” By the time he became a student at Tuskegee University in the 1970s, Muhammad was already interested in farming. Today the university is one of 107 remaining historically Black colleges and universities in the United States. “I started learning about health and nutrition as well as Black history” there, he says. A longtime educator, Muhammad has taught people how to garden and has provided fresh food to people living in food deserts. He operates a 4-acre farm in Dayton called Oasis. “This year we had corn, okra, green beans, red potatoes, lettuce,"" he says. ""I planted some raspberry bushes last year, so we got quite a few raspberries. I had some watermelon and yellow squash.” Muhammad sells the crops he grows at local farmers markets and festivals. He also works as the garden manager for the Dayton men’s shelter St. Vincent de Paul, and the produce grown there is used in the homeless shelter’s food kitchen. Muhammad’s connections through the BIPOC Food and Farming Network have helped him feel less alone as a Black farmer. It’s been encouraging, he says, “just to know there are other people who want to farm or garden or recognize the need for healthy organically grown foods and vegetables, to know that they are there.” “I’ve been able to reconnect with the land and my heritage in a way I could not have imagined even just two short years earlier,” says Anita Armstead. Armstead, a single mother of three children, including a niece and nephew, gravitated to farming through “happenstance,” she says. “I attended a lecture on food sovereignty, and the need for that in the Black community, the need for Black farms. I prayed and asked God how I could help.” In 2021 a community member who wanted to see their land used to grow food allowed Armstead to begin farming their 3.5-acre plot of land in a quiet neighborhood of Dayton. Two years later, Armstead bought the land outright. She named it Eden’s Harvest. Farming is a part of Armstead’s ministry. “I feel that the land is a gift for us. It’s an opportunity for us to not only connect with our maker, but to actually connect with ourselves.” Armstead grows zucchini, squash, beets, cabbage, broccolini, lettuce, tomatoes and peppers, in addition to amaranth, wildflowers and sunflowers. People in her neighborhood are able not only to gather food from her farm, she says, “but they can also learn how to grow food themselves. “In the future, our goal is to grow more culturally appropriate foods that really hold space for the cultural practices of our community as BIPOC people,” Armstead says. “Foods like collard greens, and dark leafy greens, and okra, potatoes, beans and watermelon.” She works with a Dayton-based food truck called Food for the Journey, which prepares hot meals for the community. “As we expand, we are definitely looking for other ways to distribute and partner with work that’s already being done in the community to increase food access,” says Armstead. Now, Armstead wants to do even more. In 2023 she joined the BIPOC Food and Farming Network’s policy fellowship to learn about agricultural laws and how to advocate for policy change. The network, she says, has also connected her with people of many different experience levels who are all working to change the food system in some meaningful way. “For me, that has been beneficial because not only do I get to see through others where I can go, but it also allows me to see where I’ve been,” she says."," The event, in its fourth year, was hosted by an Ohio-based organization called the Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) Food and Farming Network.

Then, hidden in the darkness, they move, rippling down the Delaware River in an ancient annual mass migration. For many years, the eels matured in the healthy freshwater habitat of the Upper Delaware, but natural instincts—and other unknown factors—have impelled them to uproot their lives. Now they begin a final months-long migration to the place of their birth: the Sargasso Sea, at the intersection of four Atlantic currents. There they’ll spawn, laying tens of millions of eggs in the open ocean, and die. At least, that’s what the scientists think happens. “Eels can live in our rivers for about 15 years. And then on some [usually stormy] night in the middle of fall, some take off and go back to wherever they came from,” says Mari-Beth DeLucia. She’s the director of land protection for Pennsylvania and Delaware for The Nature Conservancy, and she’s on the anguillid eel specialist group for the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is a global United Nations-associated conservation group. “But that’s not very scientific.” Many mysteries enshroud the American eel. First, no one—not a scientist nor the crew of a fishing boat—has ever witnessed eels spawning in the wild, which would be a crucial step to learning exactly where eels reproduce and thus what habitat they need. Only in the last 12 years have scientists put tracking devices on American eels and mapped their journey to their spawning grounds in the Sargasso Sea. And what triggers the eels to start that final migration? There are a lot of theories, but nobody knows for sure. Meanwhile American eels are considered endangered by the IUCN, which publishes a global list of threatened species. After decades of declines, the American eel population has stabilized at a historic low. They were hit hard by overfishing; there’s a lucrative global industry for young eels that has at times made poaching off the U.S. Atlantic coast more common. Another lingering, longstanding threat has been the loss of the freshwater habitat they, and so many other fish, rely on for much of their lives. Freshwater ecosystems are some of the most threatened in the world—broken up by dams and polluted by agriculture and cities. In the case of eels, large dams on rivers throughout the U.S. East Coast block migrations both upstream and down, and hydropower turbines sometimes chop up the adults as they make their way to the sea. A pair of simultaneous research projects are trying to shed some light on the eels’ migration. The scientists have begun tracking adult eels as they migrate down the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers to identify what environmental triggers launched these movements. Because the Delaware has no major dams and the Susquehanna has four, the twin research projects offer a tantalizing opportunity to pinpoint what conditions spark the eels to migrate and how obstacles like dams affect their migration to the Atlantic Ocean. If the two teams can identify what makes the eels begin their trek, they might be able to predict their migrations in the future. The answers they find will go a long way toward protecting migrating eels. The phone rings. When Jessica Best, a New York state biologist, answers it, a fisherman on the other end of the line tells her what she’s been waiting to hear: The eels have arrived. She calls the other researchers. DeLucia gets in her car and drives four hours north to a meeting point along the Neversink River, a tributary to the Delaware. Others come, too. There’s Dewayne Fox, a biologist and professor for Delaware State University, who is the principal researcher for this project. Best and Amanda Simmons are both New York biologists for their state’s Department of Environmental Conservation. And there are the weir fishers. Fishing weirs—rock or wood enclosures built in the river to capture fish as they move up- or downstream—have been used since ancient times by Indigenous Peoples and other fishers. Fishers hand over several eels to the biologists, who work quickly to surgically insert tiny transmitters. After sewing up the eels, the scientists watch the fish slither away downstream. As they pass underwater receivers placed throughout the river’s length, the tiny transmitters inside them will ping. About 20 years ago, when DeLucia was just starting her career, she noticed that very few people in the research world seemed to be talking about eels. “Eel numbers were crashing, and nobody knew why,” she says. “But nobody had any information because nobody ever cared about eels.” It’s a complication that other researchers cite, too. Eels have captured the imagination and horror of the general public for centuries, but they’re not studied as much as, say, American shad or Atlantic sturgeon. “They’re probably unattractive to many people. A lot of folks think they look like snakes—or they think they are snakes. You know, they’re not a warm and fuzzy fish,” says Sheila Eyler, a project leader for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Mid-Atlantic Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office. Eyler has studied eels and, as she puts it, other “ancient things” for decades. “They’re very cryptic.” They’re not snakes, or even reptiles, of course. American eels are ray-finned catadromous fish, which means they live much of their lives in freshwater rivers and estuaries but spawn in the ocean. That makes their life cycles the inverse of those of other migratory fish that, like salmon, are anadromous—meaning they live in the ocean and spawn in rivers. Each year American eel eggs hatch into leaf-shaped larvae in the Sargasso Sea and float along the Gulf Stream and other ocean currents until they reach the eastern seaboard of the Americas. By this point they’ve grown into transparent, androgynous “glass eels.” As they migrate upstream, they’ll grow into 4-inch “elvers” and then larger “yellow eels.” Over time, females may travel farther upstream than males due to their larger size. After more than a decade in freshwater habitat, they’ll undergo a process called “silvering,” where adults will sexually mature, growing larger eyes and larger stores of fat as they prepare to begin their migration back out to sea. That life cycle has intrigued some people for millennia. Ancient Egyptians believed eels were associated with the sun god Atum, created when the sun warmed the Nile. Aristotle, puzzled by the eel’s ability to appear in land-locked pools after rain, hypothesized that they emerged spontaneously from the mud. A young Sigmund Freud reportedly dissected young eels, searching for sex organs that were not there. Fascination has borne out even as researchers have begun to answer some questions. Danish biologist Ernst Johannes Schmidt discovered in 1921 that European eels—a cousin of American eels—migrate to the Sargasso Sea to spawn. He reached this conclusion after years spent systematically trawling the ocean in search of ever-smaller eels. A century later, scientists confirmed that journey using satellite tags on adult European eels. Still, no one has witnessed eels breeding in the wild—something DeLucia calls the “Holy Grail” of eel scholarship in part because, in a changing climate, understanding their habitat needs could become critical to maintaining the species. “If things are changing and they rely on the Gulf Stream to ferry larvae back to the coast and that starts to shift, not knowing where they start is a problem,” she says. Scientists aren’t the only ones on the hunt for eels. Prized as a staple in foreign cuisines, eels cannot spawn in large-scale aquaculture settings. That has led aquaculture businesses to seek out glass eels to raise. The U.S. glass eel harvest is banned in all but South Carolina and Maine, where it’s regulated and lucrative. (A single pound of glass eels, harvested legally in Maine, can sell for more than $2,000.) Globally, the trade is so profitable that young eels are said to be more valuable than their weight in heroin. In 2018, the head of the Sustainable Eel Group, Andrew Kerr, called the multibillion-dollar eel black market the “biggest wildlife crime by value on Earth.” As DeLucia, Fox and their colleagues were just beginning their eel-tracking research on the Delaware River, a nearly identical effort was underway just 60 miles west on the slow, rolling Susquehanna River. The Susquehanna is everything the Delaware is not. The Delaware River, flowing 330 miles from Hancock, New York, to the Delaware Bay, is the longest free-flowing river in the eastern U.S. It provides drinking water for millions of people in the Northeast and is the site of a landmark environmental effort that stopped the construction of a major dam in the 1970s."," For many years, the eels matured in the healthy freshwater habitat of the Upper Delaware, but natural instincts—and other unknown factors—have impelled them to uproot their lives.

Jason Throneberry, a TNC freshwater program director, talks fish cannons, endangered Alabama sturgeon and getting fish past dams.","Alabama has some of the most diverse fresh water in the United States. But dams have blocked the migrations of some fish on the state’s iconic Alabama River for decades. Jason Throneberry, the director of freshwater programs for The Nature Conservancy in Alabama, tells how a major partnership is trying to change that by building bypass channels for endangered Alabama sturgeon and other fish. “Bypass channels are, at the very least, a lifeline to those species,” says Throneberry. “This is a long game, and keeping that forward momentum is good.” Jason Throneberry: I grew up in south central Arkansas, and there are some pretty iconic rivers there: The White River, the Mississippi and the Arkansas all come together in the Gulf Coastal Plain. I spent a lot of time hunting and fishing and running around the rivers, and my wife and I were whitewater raft guides for 10 years. We’re river people. JT: I worked for the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission for nine years and went all over the state looking at imperiled aquatic organisms, from cave snails to cave fish, to darters in big rivers, to alligator gar, whatever. I gradually realized that we can manage these species individually, but we really have to work at watershed scale. If we’re going to help these species persist, then we really have to look at the whole picture. JT: We know that pre-dams, the migratory fish runs were just amazing. You had [endangered] Alabama sturgeon and [threatened] gulf sturgeon bumping all the way up against the Appalachian Mountains, trying to get up into the Appalachian portion of these rivers. That doesn’t happen anymore, because these fish can’t do their thing. Not only because there’s a dam there, but you have changed a flowing, riverine ecosystem into a series of reservoirs. There’s no flow variation; there aren’t the big flood pulses anymore. You’ve lost all that. JT: Our research partners have been telling us, “Hey, we don’t know how many more years this population can hang on—or if it’s still there.” If we’re going to do something, the time is now. So you’re two years into a joint feasibility study with the Corps of Engineers—walk us through the process. We started out the feasibility study with around 26 alternatives—everything from full dam removal to bypass channels to fish cannons to doing nothing. JT: Yeah, so they shoot salmon out of these big, huge water cannons to get them over the dam. It’s crazy, dude. Anyway, most of the fish passage [work] that’s been done in the U.S. has been done out West. So it’s very specific to salmon, trout—really strong swimmers. You’ve seen trout runs—they’re just flying through the air. We don’t have those fish. So most of the alternatives were scratched from the get-go. At the end of all that, the Corps of Engineers and TNC agreed that natural bypass channels were the best alternative, because they offer us way more opportunity to mimic what’s natural."," Jason Throneberry, the director of freshwater programs for The Nature Conservancy in Alabama, tells how a major partnership is trying to change that by building bypass channels for endangered Alabama sturgeon and other fish. “This is a long game, and keeping that forward momentum is good.” Jason Throneberry: I grew up in south central Arkansas, and there are some pretty iconic rivers there: The White River, the Mississippi and the Arkansas all come together in the Gulf Coastal Plain. JT: I worked for the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission for nine years and went all over the state looking at imperiled aquatic organisms, from cave snails to cave fish, to darters in big rivers, to alligator gar, whatever."

In 2021, the National Geographic Society and The Nature Conservancy launched a new conservation externship program designed to give youth around the world a very different version of on-the-job training. Instead of being stuck in the mailroom, participants in this virtual education, mentoring and research program have the chance to learn the latest science from a host of experts—then put it into practice. Eight hundred young adults from 123 countries and territories have already started to build skills for careers in conservation while engaging their local communities on topics that are both globally important and personally meaningful. Juan Francisco Suescún, who joined the program from Colombia, says the externship experience helped him connect more closely with communities of fishers in the Caribbean Sea who are facing declining fish stocks. “It felt like there was an opportunity to help people I care for a lot,” he says, “and also to roll up my sleeves and get to work for a cause that I find incredibly important.” As the program progressed, each participant selected aconservation issue relevant to their local community. Extern Ijunad Junaid was struck by the fact that many of his fellow Maldivians had little or no access to their island nation’s stunning coastal landscapes, and he worried that the island of Villingili was threatened by a land reclamation project. “I wanted to emphasize just how incredible and precious this island is,” he says, “and also point out the injustice of having so little accessible nature in a country that is world-famous for being beautiful.” Mentors helped externs think about how their chosen topics might be addressed and communicated most effectively, and then apply their new skills to create interactive digital presentations called ArcGIS StoryMaps, which combined text, images and video. “I was impressed by their curiosity and their willingness to learn,” says Cornelius Were Okello, a biodiversity scientist at the University of Bern who served as a mentor. “You could see their StoryMaps getting more detailed, more streamlined and better thought out throughout the process.” There were a few challenges early on, Ireland says. Internet connectivity can be erratic for some externs—participants are offered a stipend to help offset any barriers to joining the program—and coordinating a single schedule across two dozen time zones isn’t always easy. “At first it was a little like building a plane while flying,” she says. “In 2021, everyone was already deep in Zoom fatigue, and we wondered if it would be engaging enough.” But engaging with experts and fellow participants proved to be more than enough motivation for the externs. “They’re so on fire when they log in,” Ireland says. “There were definitely some nerves at first, but the good kind, where you’re anticipating something life-changing to happen,” says Suescún, who visited fishers on Isla Fuerte—an island off the northern coast of Colombia—during his externship. “I was excited to engage with people who had so much experience working for nature.” At the end of the eight weeks, externs can apply for seed funding to continue to develop their projects. About one in 10 who apply receive these extra funds after their proposals are evaluated by independent reviewers. It’s all part of the training, Ireland says—in this case, giving the externs experience applying for grants like professional scientists. If numbers are any indication, the externship program is filling a void in conservation education: To date, there have been more than 25,000 applications for 800 spots. “I think we found something that really resonates with our audience,” Gomez says. “It just shows the tremendous interest globally for this type of experience.” An additional cohort will launch next year with a focus on using powerful computer mapping systems for conservation, and plans are afoot to expand the program in multiple directions. A formal grant-writing workshop is on the list, as is funding for conference travel and setting up speaking opportunities at National Geographic Society and TNC events after each cohort graduates. “We want externs to feel supported by our organizations and know that we’re here to help them wherever they’re headed,” Ireland says. Externs have already used the experience as a launchpad to full-time jobs at places like TNC, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oceana and the Smithsonian Institution. Some graduates have been named National Geographic Society Young Explorers. “It’s been great to see them translating the experience into full-time positions,” Ireland says. The long-term goal is to expand from the current 400 externs per year to 1,500 per year in 2027. In the end, the program is all about opening doors and showing externs the paths others have taken, Gomez says, whether they’re National Geographic Explorers, TNC experts or someone else working to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. “What really energizes me is when our externs say, ‘Wow, I wasn’t aware of this career,’ or ‘This has really reinvigorated me to think about things in a new way.’” Sign up for our monthly Nature News updates for stories, tips for action and event opportunities."," “It felt like there was an opportunity to help people I care for a lot,” he says, “and also to roll up my sleeves and get to work for a cause that I find incredibly important.” As the program progressed, each participant selected aconservation issue relevant to their local community. “I wanted to emphasize just how incredible and precious this island is,” he says, “and also point out the injustice of having so little accessible nature in a country that is world-famous for being beautiful.” Mentors helped externs think about how their chosen topics might be addressed and communicated most effectively, and then apply their new skills to create interactive digital presentations called ArcGIS StoryMaps, which combined text, images and video."

It’s about 9:30 p.m. on a nearly moonless July night on the island of Wassaw—a 3-mile-wide piece of land 14 miles southeast of Savannah, Georgia. From the driver’s seat, Kris Williams Carroll scans the area ahead that’s lit through red filters on the Kawasaki’s headlights. She’s looking for trails in the sand, evidence of sea turtles. “It’ll look like tire tracks,” she says over the engine’s hum. “You can’t miss them.”  They don’t take long to spot: 3-foot-wide parallel grooves running up from the ocean. She cuts the engine. “Wait here,” she tells the three volunteer assistants in the vehicle. Williams Carroll turns toward the sand dunes, and the glow of her red headlamp disappears into the dark. (The red lights disturb sea turtles less than white lights might.) Two minutes later she returns. “She’s still digging. We’ll approach very quietly.” The assistants—all volunteers who pay to be here for a week during the summer—grab their gear and silently head toward a massive dark lump in the sand. The loggerhead sea turtle—a species considered threatened worldwide—is rhythmically moving her flippers, reaching one back flipper at a time below her and flicking a bit of sand away from the hole she’s digging. The group waits for the loggerhead to begin laying her eggs. Once she does, they’ll get to work. Williams Carroll is the director of the Caretta Research Project, a sea turtle-monitoring nonprofit. The organization began tracking sea turtle nesting on Wassaw in 1973, four years after the family that had owned the island since 1866 sold most of it to The Nature Conservancy for $1 million. TNC in turn sold it for one dollar to the Department of the Interior. Today it’s a national wildlife refuge. Each summer here and all along the Georgia coast, loggerhead sea turtles—and occasionally rarer endangered green sea turtles—lay their eggs on the state’s barrier islands and then return to the ocean. About two months later, baby sea turtles emerge from the nests and crawl to the sea. At best, the hatchlings face 1,000-to-1 odds against surviving to adulthood. And the female turtles that do survive won’t be seen on a beach in this region to lay their own eggs for perhaps another 30 years. In 2022, Georgia counted a record 4,071 nests laid along its coastline—an incredible 11-fold increase from a low 18 years earlier. Because it takes a quarter century or more for a sea turtle to reach sexual maturity, the numbers seen now are the result of decisions made decades ago. The loggerheads were legally protected as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in 1978. Changes in nest management in the 1980s resulted in fewer eggs being eaten by predators like coyotes or raccoons. And special modifications on shrimping nets developed in the 1970s and 1980s reduced the number of sea turtles getting caught in the nets. But those changes wouldn’t have helped if the turtles hadn’t had nesting space to return to. For more than 50 years, land conservation along the coast has maintained reliable nesting habitat for the sea turtles. The region is home to some of the oldest sea turtle-monitoring projects in the world—dating to the 1960s on Little Cumberland Island and 1970s on Wassaw. Today the sea turtles still face some predation and boat strikes, and those beaches—though protected—are eroding, making them more susceptible to sea-level rise and rough storms. But the growth of the loggerhead population strikes a note of hope for many of the researchers involved. If they can further stabilize the population at the highs it reached mid-century, perhaps the sea turtles can weather whatever future lies ahead. “Conservation needs to be enduring,” says Christi Lambert, TNC’s director of coastal and marine conservation in Georgia. “We’re in it for the long haul.” The night on Wassaw began at about 8 p.m. as the six volunteers and one intern loaded up two four-wheelers and got their assignments: Half would travel to the north beach and half to the south. Williams Carroll led the south crew, driving through maritime forests of slash pine and live oak that sparkled with fireflies. Low cabbage palm fronds slapped the sides of the vehicle as it made its way to the beach. “My first night, going through here, I wondered what I had gotten myself into,” says volunteer Bre Adkins, a former schoolteacher and current stay-at-home mom. Williams Carroll laughs. “Some people have told me it feels like they’ve been dropped into Jurassic Park,” she says. Sea turtles rely on undisturbed dark sandy beaches and dunes for nesting. But the scale of the conservation that has helped provide the turtles space to nest here goes far beyond the beach. Arriving on Wassaw Island—you can only travel there by boat—you wind through the tidal creeks that part the soft green marshes of Wassaw National Wildlife Refuge. In the summer, painted buntings, Wilson’s plovers, black skimmers and other songbirds call the refuge home. American alligators lounge in freshwater ponds. Juvenile sea turtles forage just offshore. It’s a far cry from many of the shores along the southeastern U.S., where high-rise hotels and condominiums glow throughout the night. On Wassaw’s beaches, the only sound is the roar of the wind and waves, and the only light comes from the moon and the stars. The Georgia coastline—105 miles long—is lined with 14 barrier islands, many of which are  still wild. After the Civil War ended in 1865, wealthy Northerners bought many of these islands and constructed Gilded Age winter retreats on them. For decades, the Rockefellers, the Carnegies, even J.P. Morgan himself retreated to rustic family compounds on the islands. A few generations later, after World War II, some family descendants began to sell off the land. Spurred by 1950s-era construction projects at Hilton Head in South Carolina and Georgia’s own Jekyll Island, conservation-minded landowners turned to wildlife agencies and environmental groups. A series of conservation land deals and easements—several involving the then-nascent TNC—followed in the next two decades. “We identified these areas as priorities many years ago, and we continue to view them as priorities,” says TNC’s Lambert. “It’s that combination of habitat and the management of the habitat and the science—the monitoring—to follow and to learn about and to help these [sea turtle] populations.” Today only four of Georgia’s 14 barrier islands are accessible by bridge. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages multiple islands as wildlife refuges. The National Park Service manages Cumberland Island—and its 18 miles of undeveloped beaches—as a national seashore. Each year more sea turtles nest on its dark, deserted sandy beaches than anywhere else in Georgia. An hour before midnight on Wassaw, the team of volunteers finds another loggerhead laying her eggs. She has metal tags with an engraved code on her front flippers as well as a “PIT tag”—a microchip—that show she has nested on Wassaw before. Her name is Esperanza. (She’s one of the project’s “adopt-a-turtle” subjects.) The team has a relatively short amount of time to work before she finishes laying her eggs and begins to cover her nest in sand. They have a lot to do. One volunteer—18-year-old Spencer Haltom—begins measuring the length and width of the turtle’s carapace, or top shell. Bre Adkins calculates the location of the sea turtle’s nest away from the shore and the geographic coordinates of this specific spot. Williams takes three biopsies from the turtle’s front flippers. Haltom’s mother, Allison—a veteran volunteer here for her seventh season—grabs an egg from beneath the turtle and places it in a plastic Ziploc bag. The egg will be processed back at the team’s inland cabin, and genetic material from it will be saved in a test tube. Williams Carroll disappears into the dunes to dig a new hole for these eggs: Esperanza laid her nest in the “wrack line”—the high-water line of debris that washes up on shore. If the nest isn’t moved, it will flood at high tide and the eggs will drown. Up to half of Wassaw’s nests are moved like this, a possible indication of the erosion even this protected beach suffers. All of these efforts to better understand the loggerhead sea turtle population that nests from here through North Carolina—a population considered genetically distinct from Florida’s—have been built in part on the work of a researcher on Little Cumberland Island. Jim Richardson, a now-retired University of Georgia ecologist, first began cataloging nests on the island where his family had a home in 1964. Two years later, nest monitoring began on Blackbeard Island, followed by Jekyll Island in 1972 and then Wassaw in 1973. In 1989, the state’s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) began collecting the data statewide, and the Georgia Sea Turtle Cooperative was born. Today the cooperative monitors 13 beaches along the coast. Sea turtle technicians with DNR permits patrol the beaches each morning before the tide washes away evidence of sea turtle tracks. They mark nests, removing a single egg from the clutch for the genetics project, and then cover nests with a grate that has holes large enough for hatchings to crawl out but narrow enough to prevent predators from looting the nest. When the hatchlings emerge from the nests later in the season, technicians count the hatched and unhatched eggs and the number of dead hatchlings to document nest mortality. “Occasionally there’ll be a few—I refer to them as the Lost Boys—who don’t make it out with the rest of the group,” says Russell Regnery, who has a home on Little Cumberland Island and now runs the sea turtle-tracking efforts on behalf of the homeowners there. “You’ll be digging the nest up and counting the eggshells and suddenly you’ll get a little turtle in your hand and then you send it on its way, too.” Dodd says the long-term nesting data combined with Shamblin’s genetic research has allowed scientists to construct a population model for loggerheads. For now, it’s expected that the population will hold steady. After growing 3.8% each year for the last decade, the population will likely stagnate, Dodd says, reflecting the slow growth of the population in the early 2000s that will soon be reaching maturity. “Then ultimately, maybe in 2040, we expect the population to start increasing back toward historic levels from the late 1950s.” In the dunes on Wassaw, lit by her red headlamp light, Williams Carroll is using a giant heart cockle shell to dig a new hole for Esperanza’s clutch, her arm buried deep in the sand. “It’s the best thing for it,” she says of the shell. The hole, if cut in a cross section, will look roughly like a misshapen upside-down lightbulb. Williams and the team will ultimately move up to half of the nests laid on Wassaw to safer areas farther inland to keep them from drowning at high tide. Williams Carroll, who first came to the Caretta Research Project in 1996, remembers stargazing from a military fort on the north beach that dates to the Spanish-American War. Today the fort is in the ocean. The beach there is studded by dead trees—not unlike the famous Driftwood Beach on Jekyll Island—where soil erosion has allowed salt water to inundate the roots of the old forest, killing the trees where they stand. The wider, sandier south beach—where Esperanza laid her nest—tends to host more nests. The Georgia coastline, lined with 368,000 acres of salt marshes, is ever changing. Rivers run down from the middle of the state, some of them carrying sediment that’s deposited on the islands. When those rivers are healthy, they create an ecological balance: The ocean washes away the islands and the alluvial rivers build them up. Nowhere is this more visible than about halfway down the coastline on Little St. Simons Island, where its northern beach is growing at a rate of 2 to 3 feet per year—a boon for the sea turtles that come to nest here and a rarity along the coastline. The 11,000-acre, largely undeveloped landscape sits at the mouth of the Altamaha River—a river TNC’s Christi Lambert calls “Georgia’s little Amazon.” At times the river can stretch 6 miles wide, flooding freshwater tidal forests, the water brown with the earth it carries. Down the coast this year, Lambert helped the homeowners of privately owned Little Cumberland Island construct a “living shoreline”—reinforcing shores and dunes with natural materials like sand or vegetation. There are 10 more completed installations she can name off the top of her head, a string of projects designed to test natural ways to slow coastal erosion caused by storms and sea-level rise. “It’s important now,” Lambert says, “to work with climate-change predictions and modeling and manage the coast for that—to recognize that in addition to a changing climate and the threats coming from that, we have an increase in people using these beaches, too.” On Wassaw, Esperanza has returned to the sea. And, just after midnight, the crew spots another turtle. As she lays her eggs, locked in a trance, the volunteers complete their work and then sit beside her, taking the moment in. One front flipper bears a metal tag marked “KKU798.” She’s been here before. The sand glints on the sea turtle’s carapace, and one of the volunteers shuts off her red headlamp. In the dark, a wave of iridescence sparkles on the turtle’s shell. “Look at the fluorescence,” says volunteer Amelia Gleaton Luke, a former high school science teacher. Among the barnacles on her back, KKU798 is carrying tiny bioluminescent creatures on her journey. KKU798 eventually lumbers toward the sea, where an otherworldly glow shimmers along the edges of the waves. More fluorescence. Once she’s done nesting—sea turtles sometimes nest repeatedly in a single season—she’ll likely head off to the Chesapeake Bay area peninsula, Williams Carroll says. Satellite transmitters the program attached to a couple of sea turtles this year indicate the reptiles are moving up that way. “There’s great feeding grounds there,” she says. Eventually, the transmitters and past research have shown, this sea turtle will likely return to a beach along this coastline to nest again in two or three years. Williams Carroll could soon start seeing the nests of some of the turtles that hatched in 1996, her first season on Wassaw. She seems to not have dwelled on that idea much till now. “It’s a neat thought,” she says. “But everything we’re seeing here now is the result of people before us: we’re seeing the results of their labor.” It’s a sentiment shared by Mark Dodd. “At one point we were very concerned that we were losing loggerheads as a species in Georgia,” he says. “We stand on the shoulders of all these folks who were here in the ’60s and ’70s. It was a lot of hard work to maintain a very high quality of data. We just need to maintain that so we can continue to get those answers that we need to manage the population.” The moon finally rises around 4 a.m. on Wassaw, and the sun follows not long after. Bug-bitten, sleepy but energized, the week’s crew of volunteers returns to the mainland the next afternoon and off to their daily lives. Two days later the first hatchlings of the season emerge from a nest laid in May. They crawl into the ocean at dawn."," It’s about 9:30 p.m. on a nearly moonless July night on the island of Wassaw—a 3-mile-wide piece of land 14 miles southeast of Savannah, Georgia.

Oak and hickory forests are giving way to maples and poplars that use more water as they grow. Greg Cooper, a forest ecologist for The Nature Conservancy in North Carolina, is leading an experimental effort to slow the shift and give the oaks and hickories—important for local wildlife—a fighting chance. Greg Cooper: I grew up in upstate New York, in a small town outside of Albany. I was really interested in reptiles and amphibians. My dad [and I] would do frog-calling surveys. We’d listen to get a sense of how many frogs were in an area, and a huge decline in amphibian populations was observable even in that time. After undergrad, I served in Paraguay for two years as an environmental action volunteer working with small landholder farmers, implementing sustainable ag projects. Working in an agricultural economy and seeing how land was being converted in a pretty major way was also superformative. The pairing of those two things—the biodiversity crisis and the conversion of a forest and the impacts that had on biodiversity—was a natural lead-in to forestry. GC: From a historical perspective, this is the cradle of forestry in America. The first foresters were trained right in our backyard, not even half a mile from where I live right now. Ecologically and biologically, this is an incredibly biodiverse region. It has the highest salamander biodiversity in the world. There’s a high amount of diversity of aquatic species. The number of tree species is overwhelming; I still don’t know them all. The most interesting ecotype that we work with, and the biggest, is our oak/hickory forest, [which] is incredibly important for biodiversity because of the food that oaks and hickories provide for wildlife.

Officials counted just 417 nesting pairs—a shocking fraction of the estimated 100,000 birds that once soared the skies in the 18th century, and a grim reinforcement of Carson’s warning against agriculture’s indiscriminate use of chemicals like the pesticide DDT. Other species’ numbers were plummeting as well. A postwar boom in construction, logging and agriculture was polluting the nation’s air and water and degrading habitats for many animals, including grizzly bears, whooping cranes and shortnose sturgeon. Amid a groundswell of public concern for the imperiled wildlife and the broader environment, the federal government began implementing a series of conservation measures. In 1970, Congress established the Environmental Protection Agency, which in 1972 outlawed most uses of DDT. Then, in 1973, President Nixon signed the Endangered Species Act, which mandated steps to protect and restore plants or animals identified as “threatened” or “endangered.” In doing so, it provided a framework
for protecting species and their ecosystems from further decline, and it signaled to the world that direct action could make a difference. Alligator mississippiensis There are only two species of alligator in the world: American and Chinese. The former was listed as endangered under earlier legislation—the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966—after hunting pushed it near extinction. Once protected by the Endangered Species Act’s limitations on alligator products and hunting—as well as increased conservation of its habitat—populations recovered.  American alligators mostly live in coastal parts of the southeastern United States. They rely on fresh water to live but can tolerate salt water for brief periods of time for foraging, says Eric Krueger, TNC’s director of science and stewardship in South Carolina. “They tend to be on the outer coast, where tides promote growth of grassy wetlands where they can build nests and get in the sun.”  With only limited hunting allowed, the American alligator’s primary threat now is habitat loss caused by development and the pressure that climate change is putting on tidal freshwater areas. The Nature Conservancy has been involved in protecting the species by conserving wetlands throughout the Southeast. In South Carolina’s Ashepoo, Combahee and Edisto Basin, TNC has protected more than 83,000 acres, contributing to a combined
310,000 acres privately and publicly protected in the region. Delisted in 1987 and with an estimated population of 5 million today, the American alligator is still monitored because it closely resembles the American crocodile, which overlaps with its range in southern Florida and is listed as endangered.  American alligators help balance ecosystems by keeping populations of species lower on the food chain in check. Today they face a growing new threat: clashes with humans. Though they don’t typically attack people,
alligators are attracted to stormwater ponds in developed areas. Do not leave food there, says Krueger. “Feeding them breaks down their natural fear.” Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus High in the Allegheny mountains of West Virginia and Virginia, the nighttime movements of foot-long flying squirrels are a sign that all is well in this Appalachian world. The nocturnal mammal depends on a specific, truffle-like fungus as its primary food source, and that fungus in turn depends on the roots of healthy red spruce trees. “It’s a web, not a linear relationship,” says Mike Powell, director of land management and stewardship for TNC in West Virginia. The squirrel propagates the fungus through its droppings, exemplifying a symbiotic relationship reflective of a healthy ecosystem. It wasn’t always this way though. Logging activity in the 1800s destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of red spruce, replacing the squirrel’s once-cool, moist habitat with a sun-baked expanse prone to flooding and erosion. “It was described as the greatest spruce forest known to man,” says Powell, “but once it was discovered by industrial loggers, it disappeared very quickly—almost every standing spruce was cut.” By 1985, the squirrel was of such concern that it was listed as endangered, setting into motion a range of conservation projects and partnerships. Among TNC’s collaborators is the Central Appalachian Spruce Restoration Initiative. The Nature Conservancy has also protected thousands of acres of these forests and, to ensure they remain undisturbed by mining, purchased the mineral rights for 57,000 acres on Cheat Mountain as well as 4,000 surface-rights acres in high-elevation areas. “Collectively,” says Powell, “we have planted over 2 million red spruce and associated trees.” That equates to about 70,000 acres in which red spruce is once again the dominant canopy. Delisted in 2013, the squirrel, like so many species, is now threatened by climate change and will require a habitat that is more resilient than ever if it is to survive. These forests have been through several stress points, says Powell. “We’re working as hard and as fast as we can to restore them.”"," Officials counted just 417 nesting pairs—a shocking fraction of the estimated 100,000 birds that once soared the skies in the 18th century, and a grim reinforcement of Carson’s warning against agriculture’s indiscriminate use of chemicals like the pesticide DDT.

The father-daughter duo started their nursery not long ago near Bootless Bay, outside Papua New Guinea’s capital city of Port Moresby. It’s part of a larger project to help regenerate the area’s lost shoreline mangrove trees. Meanwhile, hours away in the mountainside village of Simbukanam, Lawrence Micah is working with local communities to formalize land ownership maps that can be used to prevent loggers from encroaching onto their forested land, and to hold them accountable in court if they do. Though both efforts face uniquely different challenges, they are both trying to save the forests upon which their communities depend. Papua New Guinea is home to about 12 million people, 1,000 distinct cultures and more than 850 languages, some with no linguistic relatives anywhere in the world. The nation’s human diversity is only matched by its ecology: The island of New Guinea boasts the third-largest tract of tropical rainforest in the world, and 30% of its flora and fauna are endemic. It’s home to a greater variety of vascular plants than any other island on the planet and 740 species of birds. “Papua New Guinea is probably the most biologically and culturally diverse place on Earth,” says Richard Hamilton, The Nature Conservancy’s senior science and conservation advisor for the Asia-Pacific region. “It’s an amazing country.” Mangrove forests can strike humans as somewhat unnerving. The trees’ prop roots tangle together in dense thickets, while the decomposing detritus that accumulates around them releases malodorous gases. And all that dark, still water provides perfect cover for snakes and saltwater crocodiles. “When people look at the mangrove, they see somewhere that’s smelly, muddy or dirty,” acknowledges Mazzella Maniwavie, a scientist working on mangrove conservation for The Nature Conservancy in Papua New Guinea. “But mangroves are special, because they are able to grow in a place where no other tree can grow.” A terrestrial plant that survives in salt water, mangroves are a sort of marvel. Acre for acre, mangrove forests can sequester three to five times more carbon than a terrestrial tropical forest. Mangroves also stabilize the coastline, providing a buffer against storm surges and flooding and preventing excess sediment from running into the sea, where it may smother coral reefs. They provide habitat for fish, reptiles and birds. And those are important to Papua New Guineans, which is why TNC is helping local communities lead the way in their conservation. Since Maniwavie was born in 1987, Papua New Guinea’s capital, Port Moresby, has more than doubled in size; it’s now home to 400,000 people. In many ways, though, the nearby inlet known as Bootless Bay feels much the same as it did when she was a girl, tagging along on research expeditions with her father, a marine biologist at University of Papua New Guinea. “Every time I come here it connects me back to where I started,” she says. But Bootless Bay has also changed. People have inadvertently killed mangroves by digging up their roots to collect blood worms, a valuable fish bait. Woodcutting for fuel and construction has also taken its toll, as has a decade of coastal development. Meanwhile, higher tides driven by climate change upset the balance between salt water and fresh water. “It’s painful to watch something get degraded,” Maniwavie says, “especially if you know people don’t really understand the importance of it.” Maniwavie is not simply watching, however. She leads Mangoro Market Meri, a program that encourages Papua New Guinean women (“meri”) to be stewards of the country’s mangroves. Founded in 2016 at a TNC conference that brought together women from across the region, the program connects communities with economic opportunities that let them benefit from nearby mangrove forests without depleting them. At present, that includes sustainably harvesting mud crabs, crustaceans the size of a dinner plate that are in high demand at area seafood markets. The program hopes to link local people with carbon credit initiatives, which could infuse this developing region with global cash. “That provides an incentive to conservation,” Maniwavie says. It’s also vital that women be at the center of the effort. Throughout the Asia-Pacific region, women make up a majority of the population using mangroves. They have a wealth of knowledge about the species of mangrove in their areas and the health of the ecosystem generally. “But then there’s the reality that many communities in Papua New Guinea that you go to, it’s a patriarchal society, and women are not necessarily part of the decision-making process,” Maniwavie says. “So we work with communities to empower the women.” Three hundred miles north of Bootless Bay in mountainous Madang Province, TNC is helping rural people organize to assert their land rights and protect a very different sort of forest. “We’ve always looked at conservation, conservation, conservation,” says Cosmas Apelis, who leads TNC’s efforts here. “But you have to take people into consideration, because they are the stewards of the land.” Madang is a place where people’s lives are not much different from their ancestors’. “The forest is our livelihood,” says Lawrence Micah, who has lived his entire 50 years in the village of Simbukanam. “It’s our food, it’s our hospital, and everything.” He is the chairman of the Gildipasi Conservation Group, an association that represents local villages to give them a stronger collective voice in regional issues. He has witnessed virgin forest cut down by companies that had dubious reputations and even more dubious logging permissions. His goal is to see local land-use rules formalized and recognized by the provincial government. He, TNC and other conservation groups are working with community members to develop land use plans that preserve the forests for the long term. With little involvement from the regional or national governments, they abide by customary property rights, under which the people living nearby are the land’s owners and caretakers. However, resisting logging companies' well-funded operations requires local people to stand together—and get creative. Apelis relates the story of a community that recently discovered a logging operation had encroached illegally onto its land. “It came to a head where they had had enough,” Apelis says. “The company had left all the logging machinery, all the trucks and all that, lined them on the highway. So the people came and took all the keys. And so the police had to come in, and the provincial government had to step in, because people said, ‘We are not going to give back the keys until the government comes and explains why it isn’t doing monitoring and enforcement.’ They put their foot down, and that’s when they got respect.” The Nature Conservancy aids local communities by lending surveying expertise as they formalize their customary land rights and record the locations of critical resources like streams. The organization is also supporting local people in their campaigns to arrange community-wide conservation pledges. Sometimes local leaders disagree about conservation goals, but the discourse among neighboring communities often makes for stronger resolutions in the end. Micah is optimistic that the agreements and some new farming prospects will offset the pressure from outside logging companies. The Conservancy is also connecting people with sustainable economic opportunities—it’s easier to turn down a logging company’s offer to buy your timber rights when you have an alternative source of revenue. New village-based savings and loans have helped entrepreneurs build businesses. Some communities are pursuing organic certification for cash crops like cocoa, coconuts and vanilla. Eventually, TNC also hopes to link communities to nature-based solutions such as the international carbon market, which will help them generate income by conserving their forests. “Conservation should be a development tool,” Apelis says. In Papua New Guinea, that’s a theme that runs from the mountains all the way to the sea (“ridges to reefs,” as many of TNC’s Pacific staffers like to put it). “We build the capacity for people to do conservation, but at the same time, we help empower them economically.” In Bootless Bay, one of the businesses that Mangoro Market Meri supports is Karikari Mangrove Nursery, which Dulcie Egu and her father, Koivi, founded last year after receiving training through TNC. With guidance from Maniwavie, they and their mostly female employees are growing mangrove saplings. The community-based nurseries in Bootless Bay have helped replant more than 3,000 mangroves. Over the next decade, Mangoro Market Meri, which buys the baby mangroves from the nurseries for about a dollar each, aims to plant at least 200,000 more. “We live here, and we know the importance of mangrove,” Dulcie says, standing beside a greenhouse that shelters hundreds of propagules. “We know what mangroves bring into our lives. ... When we cut it down today, if we don’t replace it, then in the future our children will suffer.” In addition to serving as a source of food and wood, Dulcie explains, mangroves protect against floods. She shrugs: Helping them just makes sense. It makes Maniwavie proud. As women plant mangroves in Bootless Bay, and as mountain villages rally around preserving the tropical rainforest, Papua New Guineans take seriously their role as caretakers. “It gives me hope,” Maniwavie says. “The fact that the community takes ownership and the initiative to do the restoration work by themselves, it’s changing the tide. Nobody can do it better than themselves.”"," The father-daughter duo started their nursery not long ago near Bootless Bay, outside Papua New Guinea’s capital city of Port Moresby.

           into the muggy                                                                                                    July night. Five minutes later, three more flutter out. At 8:26, there’s a steady stream. By half past the hour, the entrance—a sinkhole 15 feet across—is a vortex of flying bodies. The darkness pulses with leathery wing beats carrying the rush of cold subterranean air, and a quarter of a million bats rise, spiraling into the surrounding trees in a seemingly endless ribbon—the largest summer bat emergence in the eastern United States. “Back in 2010, I thought I’d never see this sight again,” says Cory Holliday, The Nature Conservancy’s cave and karst program director in Tennessee. “I thought gray bats were done for, that they were something I’d tell my kids about.” He feared the impact of white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that started killing hibernating bats in New York in 2006, and soon after began an unstoppable tear across North America. Federally threatened gray bats, year-round cave-roosting mammals that amass in vast colonies, seemed to be at high risk, with the majority of Tennessee’s population relying on just four caves for hibernation. White-nose syndrome takes its name from the white residue it leaves on bats’ faces and wings, but it’s lethal because it wakes bats during winter hibernation—when every calorie counts. “Bats are nature’s ultimate accountant,” says Pete Pattavina, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service bat biologist. “They measure every energy expenditure and gain, and it’s always a delicate balance for them to make it through winter.” The waking of an infected bat during hibernation triggers its metabolism and body temperature to rise. Without a food source to offset those costs, the interruption means that the bat runs through its winter energy store and dies. The disease has slashed northern long-eared bat and little brown bat populations by 90% across their ranges. Indiana bats are not far behind, sustaining an 85% decline. Bat populations were hardest hit in northern states, while those in warmer climes (with shorter hibernations) are faring slightly better. Overall, millions have died nationwide. But, miraculously, the hit to the remaining gray bat populations never came. No one knows exactly why. Bats play a vital role in our ecosystems. They are key seed dispersers and pollinators, and insectivorous bats can eat one-third of their body weight in moths, beetles and other bugs in one night. One study estimates they save the U.S. agricultural industry an annual $23 billion in pesticides. But 15 years after the juggernaut of white-nose syndrome, it’s unlikely that some bats will regain their historic numbers. “A worst-case future scenario is that we see the complete collapse of little brown bats, tri-colored bats and northern long-eared bats,” Pattavina says. “A best case would be a modest increase in abundance, but I don’t expect a big splash of a return.” White-nose syndrome is here to stay, but so is the new collaborative approach to bat conservation it galvanized. “White-nose syndrome gave everyone a shared purpose, and that coordination has spilled over to other bat projects, because we don’t take common species for granted anymore,” says Dustin Thames of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, a frequent partner in Holliday’s efforts. Holliday himself is at the center of Tennessee’s bat action and cave protection. After spending five years surveying life in the state’s caves, Holliday pivoted his program in the early days of white-nose syndrome’s outbreak to focus on bat research and conservation. To protect an animal is to protect its habitat, he says. Tennessee is home to 11,500 known limestone caves, the most of any state in the country; it is a bounty of underground space stemming from the region’s limestone geology. The spirit of collaboration that’s now a hallmark of Tennessee’s bat work is on display at Bellamy Cave. The Nature Conservancy purchased the cave in 2006, when it sheltered 140,000 bats in winter and 35,000 in summer. Today, after gate installations and protection work by TNC and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, those numbers ring in at 350,000 in winter and 250,000 in summer. Tonight, 17 biologists—representing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, the University of Tennessee, Sewanee: The University of the South and the Department of Defense—are here to attach transmitters to as many gray bats as possible to gather tracking data. In a nightly summer ritual, the gray bats traverse a mile of Bellamy’s inky passageways, emerging as darkness falls to forage. That is, except for those that hit the harp trap—a device that looks like its namesake, with strategically spaced strings that snag bats who attempt to fly through and deliver them (unharmed) into a trough below. Two biologists pluck captives from the trough and pop each into a brown paper sack. Runners ferry the bags up a hill to a processing station and clip the bags onto a clothesline. Teams of biologists fetch a bat at a time to record basic information like sex and weight. Each bat receives a tiny forearm band and a transmitter glued on its back. All of this is done on a ticking timer because, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rules, these endangered bats can’t be held longer than 45 minutes to avoid overstressing them. The data from the radio transmitters is key to learning more about these misunderstood mammals: What are critical habitats for foraging and migration? What are their biggest threats, besides white-nose syndrome? As the tagged bats fly, they’ll pass Motus Wildlife Tracking System towers dotted across the landscape. The towers are a recent addition to the biologist’s toolbox; they pick up signals from any passing tagged animal, logging location data that can be easily shared. Motus started as a collaborative way to track birds, but Holliday harnessed its capabilities for bats and has installed 18 towers in Tennessee. The tracking data will shape future conservation efforts, and Holliday hopes it will illustrate where to avoid building wind turbines, a looming threat. Back at Bellamy, it’s almost 10 p.m.; headlamps illuminate five tables strewn with glue bottles and data clipboards. “We have 15 minutes before we have to release,” calls Holliday. Bags still hang from the clothesline, far too many bats to process as the minutes fly. Soon, time is up. In total, the biologists have attached 41 transmitters. Those 41 bats will flit across the landscape, ranging 50 miles in a single night, each Motus tower they pass pinging with a data point that’s a window into a secret life. The biologists head to the clothesline, reach into the bags and withdraw the furious little mammals within. They raise an arm, open a hand and cast each bat back into the night, like an offering to the sky."," The darkness pulses with leathery wing beats carrying the rush of cold subterranean air, and a quarter of a million bats rise, spiraling into the surrounding trees in a seemingly endless ribbon—the largest summer bat emergence in the eastern United States. “Back in 2010, I thought I’d never see this sight again,” says Cory Holliday, The Nature Conservancy’s cave and karst program director in Tennessee. “I thought gray bats were done for, that they were something I’d tell my kids about.” He feared the impact of white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that started killing hibernating bats in New York in 2006, and soon after began an unstoppable tear across North America."

In this interview, she tells how she and others at TNC are helping European countries map where to place renewable energy to reduce potential impacts on the environment. Dragana Mileusnić: The freshwater biodiversity in the region is globally unique. There are many species that appear in the Balkans and nowhere else. There are wild rivers and forests that have survived to a much greater extent than anywhere else in Europe. Most of the rivers in Europe have been dammed or channelized—for example, put into concrete riverbeds—whereas, in the Balkans, the rivers are still mostly untouched. That’s what we’re working on protecting. The reality is that given the area’s slower development, the energy sector—including hydropower—has developed more slowly. So now this is one of the last places in Europe where there is a lot of interest in new hydropower. At one point, an analysis [in 2017] showed interest in building 2,000 to 3,000 dams—mainly small structures that would do a lot of damage to rivers without actually creating a lot of electricity."," When the war in Ukraine began in 2022, it accelerated an ongoing energy shift: European nations trying to reduce their dependence on Russian gas rushed to build up the continent's renewable energy sources.
