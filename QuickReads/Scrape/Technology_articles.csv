200,Technology,When could TikTok be banned under new US law?,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53476117,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14047/production/_133219918_tiktok-gettyimages-2074368670.jpg.webp,"APRIL 26, 2024",The video app TikTok could be banned in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance.,"TikTok could be banned in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance. The video sharing app has millions of users worldwide, but has faced questions over the security of users' data and its links to the government in Beijing. Lawmakers from both major US political parties have called for a law that bans TikTok unless ByteDance agrees to sell the app to a non-Chinese company. They fear the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users. TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government. The House of Representatives and Senate have now both approved a $95bn (£76bn) foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan which also contained a bill paving the way for the forced sale of TikTok. The legislation has been signed into law by President Joe Biden. Previous attempts to block the app in the US on national security grounds have failed. Former US President Donald Trump tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020. But Mr Trump - the Republican 2024 presidential candidate - has criticised the new legislation, arguing that limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook. Although Mr Biden has signed the bill into law, it does not mean an immediate US ban for TikTok. The legislation gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to a new buyer, with an additional three-month grace period, before any ban would take effect. That means that the sale deadline would most likely come some time in 2025, after the winner of the 2024 presidential election takes office. If Mr Trump wins, he may seek to block the ban from being implemented. TikTok has vowed to fight the forced sale in the courts, which could take years. The most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices. App stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. It would also mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs. The bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US. It gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. TikTok has called the legislation an ""unconstitutional ban"" and affront to the US right to free speech. ""We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,"" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. ""Rest assured,"" he told users in a video, ""we aren't going anywhere"". He previously said the bill would give its social media rivals more power and put thousands of American jobs at risk. ByteDance would also have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move. Many US creators and users have criticised the potential ban. Tiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work. In March 2024, TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill. But the deluge of ""confused"" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired. Several politicians said the campaign worsened the concerns they had about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation. It is thought the US TikTok bill could inspire similar moves elsewhere. TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia. The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears. At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm, a set of instructions which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material. Users are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You. The Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app. This curated feed has become the main destination for users looking for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral. Critics say the app collects more data than other social media platforms in order to power its highly personalised system. This can include information about users' location, device, the content they engage with and keystroke rhythms they exhibit while typing. But popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar data from users. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

201,Technology,Meta AI spending plans cause share price slump,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl40v5x483yo,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a0b9/live/3a45b540-0279-11ef-a922-7b933c00b69a.jpg.webp,"APRIL 26, 2024",Investors react badly to the Facebook and WhatsApp owner spending more than anticipated on AI.,"Shares in Meta - the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram - fell sharply after it announced higher than expected spending on artificial intelligence (AI). They went down more than 15% in after-hours trading in New York despite the tech giant revealing strong earnings figures. Boss Mark Zuckerberg said it would take some time before its huge AI investment increased revenues. Meta also said its X rival, Threads, now has more than 150 million monthly active users, increasing the pressure on the Elon Musk-owned platform. ""Threads is well on its way to beating X by becoming the Twitter alternative users and advertisers are longing for,"" said Mike Proulx, from analysts Forrester. He also said Meta stood to gain from TikTok's possible sale or ban in the US - a development the app has vowed to fight. Meta has been updating its ad-buying products with AI tools to boost earnings growth. It has also been introducing more AI features on its social media platforms such as chat assistants. The firm said it now expected to spend between $35bn and $40bn, (£28bn-32bn) in 2024, up from an earlier prediction of $30-$37bn. For investors, that outweighed the positive news on earnings. First quarter revenue rose 27% to $36.46bn, while analysts had expected earnings of $36.16bn. Analysts though said there was a logic to Meta's approach. Sophie Lund-Yates, from Hargreaves Lansdown, said Meta's ""substantial investment"" in AI has helped it get people to spend time on its platforms, so advertisers were willing to spend more money ""in a time when digital advertising uncertainty remains rife"". More than 50 countries are due to have elections this year, she said, ""which hugely increases uncertainty"" and can spook advertisers. Ms Lund-Yates said that ""looking further ahead, the biggest risk [for Meta] remains regulatory"". Last year, Meta was fined €1.2bn (£1bn) by Ireland's data authorities for mishandling people's data when transferring it between Europe and the US. And in February of this year, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg faced blistering criticism from US lawmakers and was pushed to apologise to families of victims of child sexual exploitation. Ms Lund-Yates added that the firm has ""more than enough resources to throw at legal challenges, but that doesn’t rule out the risks of ups and downs in market sentiment"". Copyright 2024 BBC.

202,Technology,Tesla profits slump by more than a half,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72pvz18x4lo,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6696/live/460a1f90-01bd-11ef-911a-89ede1ae3943.jpg.webp,"APRIL 25, 2024",The EV maker brings forward launch plans for new models as profits drop by more than half.,"Tesla has announced its profits fell sharply in the first three months of the year to $1.13bn (£910m), compared with $2.51bn in 2023. It caps a difficult period for the electric vehicle (EV) maker, which - faced with falling sales - has announced thousands of job cuts. Boss Elon Musk remains bullish about its prospects, telling investors the launch of new models would be brought forward. Its share price has risen but analysts say it continues to face significant challenges, including from lower-cost rivals. The company has suffered from falling demand and competition from cheaper Chinese imports which has led its stock price to collapse by 43% over 2024. Figures for the first quarter of 2024 revealed revenues of $21.3bn, down on analysts' predictions of just over $22bn. But the decision by Tesla to bring forward the launch of new models from the second half of 2025 boosted its shares by nearly 12.5% in after-hours trading. It did not reveal pricing details for the new vehicles. However Mr Musk made clear he also grander ambitions, touting Tesla's AI credentials and plans for self-driving vehicles - even going as far as to say considering it to be just a car company was the ""wrong framework."" ""If somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy I think they should not be an investor,"" he said. Such sentiments have been questioned by analysts though, with Deutsche Bank saying driverless cars face ""technological, regulatory and operational challenges."" Some investors have called for the company to instead focus on releasing a lower price, mass-market EV. However, Tesla has already been on a charm offensive, trying to win over new customers by dropping its prices in a series of markets in the face of falling sales. It also said its situation was not unique. ""Global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs,"" it said. Despite plans to bring forward new models originally planned for next year the firm is cutting its workforce. Tesla said it would lose 3,332 jobs in California and 2,688 positions in Texas, starting mid-June. The cuts in Texas represent 12% of Tesla's total workforce of almost 23,000 in the area where its gigafactory and headquarters are located. However, Mr Musk sought to downplay the move. ""Tesla has now created over 30,000 manufacturing jobs in California!"" he said in a post on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday. Another 285 jobs will be lost in New York. Tesla's total workforce stood at more than 140,000 late last year, up from around 100,000 at the end of 2021, according to the company's filings with US regulators.  The car firm is also facing other issues, with a struggle over Mr Musk's compensation still raging on. On Wednesday, Tesla asked shareholders to vote for a proposal to accept Mr Musk's compensation package - once valued at $56bn - which had been rejected by a Delaware judge. The judge found Tesla's directors had breached their fiduciary duty to the firm by awarding Mr Musk the pay-out. Due to the fall in Tesla's stock value, the compensation package is now estimated to be around $10bn less - but still greater than the GDP of many countries. In addition, Tesla wants its shareholders to agree to the firm being moved from Delaware to Texas - which Mr Musk called for after the judge rejected his payday. Copyright 2024 BBC.

The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said it had discovered more than two thousand remotely filmed child abuse images of three to six-year-olds online in 2023. If follows recent warnings from the communications watchdog Ofcom that almost a quarter of children aged five to seven have a smartphone of their own. Responding to the report Security Minister Tom Tugendhat urged tech firms to do more to prevent abuse. He also called on parents ""to speak to your children about their use of social media, because the platforms you presume safe may pose a risk”. The IWF is a charity which helps detect and remove child sexual abuse imagery online. New analysis published in its latest annual report revealed it had discovered 2401 images of children aged three to six in so-called “self-generated” images on the open internet in 2023. “Self-generated” images are where a child is persuaded, coerced or tricked by a predator into carrying out acts via a webcam or handheld device. Nearly one in seven images were category A - the rating it assigns to those featuring the most serious abuse. Six in 10 images showed “sexual posing with nudity” it suggested. Analysts who reviewed some of the images found many, “were are taken at home in children’s bedrooms or in family bathrooms when the child is alone or with another child such as a sibling or friend”. Sometimes children were “completely unaware” they were being recorded. IWF analysts were confident that someone else was directing what happened as three to six-year-old children “are sexually naive and would not normally be aware of the possibility of this type of sexual behaviour,” it said. The report also notes that online child abuse material is more “extreme” with the charity reporting a 22% increase in category A imagery. Ofcom's research suggested a third of parents whose five to seven-year-olds browse social media are allowed to do so alone. Ian Critchley, who leads on child protection for the National Police Chiefs' Council, said protecting young children was not just the responsibility of parents and carers. ""The biggest change"" needed to come from the tech companies and online platforms, he said. As part of its work implementing the new Online Safety Act the communications watchdog has said it will consult on how automated tools, including AI, can be used to ""proactively detect"" illegal content - including child sexual abuse material. But the IWF is calling for swift action and argues technology firms should not wait. ""The harms are happening to children now, and our response must be immediate,"" its chief executive Susie Hargreaves said. AI is already used by some big tech firms to help identify content that violates its terms, including child abuse material. This is principally used to help identify material that is then reviewed by human moderators. But experts warn AI alone is not a panacea. Professor Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey told the BBC: ""AI may prove useful in helping with the scale of the data being analysed but at its current state of development it shouldn’t be considered a complete solution.""

Commissioner Thierry Breton said the feature is ""toxic and addictive"", particularly when used by children. TikTok has until Wednesday to defend the rewards programme, or it could be suspended as early as Thursday 25 April. TikTok told the BBC it was disappointed with the decision. ""We stand ready to trigger... interim measures including the suspension of the TikTok Lite reward programme,"" said European Commissioner Thierry Breton in a post on X, formerly Twitter. In addition, the Commission has opened formal proceedings against the social media company to assess whether it has broken EU law. Under EU law which came into force last year, large platforms like TikTok have to produce a risk assessment before they make large changes to their products. The Commission asked for TikTok's risk assessment into the Task & Rewards programme last week, but says the social media company failed to submit it in time. It has said that the system risks ""serious damage for the mental health of users"". TikTok launched its ""Task and Rewards"" programme last week in France and Spain. It is a new feature on TikTok Lite, a slimmed-down version of the main social media app, which uses less data and space on users' phones. Under the programme, users can earn the equivalent of a few pence per day for watching videos and engaging on the app. The Commission is investigating whether this could have negative effects on the mental health of users, including children, ""especially as a result of the new feature stimulating addictive behaviour"". TikTok says rewards are only open to people over the age of 18, and tools are in place to verify their ages. But the Commission suspects a ""lack of effective age verification mechanisms"". TikTok has no plans to roll the feature out beyond France and Spain as it stands. It is also available in some countries in southeast Asia. This is the second formal investigation into TikTok launched in the EU. In February, the Commission opened formal proceedings against the social media company, investigating whether it broke rules around data protection, protection for children and policing harmful content. At the time, TikTok said it would cooperate with the investigation and continued to work with experts in online safety. Under the EU's Digital Services Act, companies can be fined up to 6% of global revenue. In a statement issued to the BBC, a TikTok spokesperson said: ""We are disappointed with this decision - the TikTok Lite rewards hub is not available to under 18s, and there is a daily limit on video watch tasks.

According to the claim, lodged at the High Court in London, ""covert tracking technology"" was deployed, and highly sensitive information was illegally shared with advertisers. Law firm Austen Hays says there are more than 650 claimants and ""thousands"" of UK users were affected. Grindr says it will ""respond vigorously"" to the claim. A Grindr spokesperson said the company takes privacy ""extremely seriously"", and added the claim ""appears to be based on a mischaracterization of practices from more than four years ago"". Austen Hays says, if the case is successful, claimants could receive thousands of pounds in damages. The claim form submitted to the High Court says the law firm hopes to claim more than £100,000 in total. Chaya Hanoomanjee from Austen Hays, who is the lawyer leading the claim, said the claimants ""experienced significant distress over their highly sensitive and private information being shared without their consent"". “Grindr owes it to the LGBTQ+ community it serves to compensate those whose data has been compromised,"" she said. The dating app is used by 13 million people every month, and an Ofcom report from May 2023 found that it was used by roughly 924,000 people in the UK. It also had the highest engagement of all dating apps, with people using it for an average time of six hours and 49 minutes that month. According to the claim, the company shared sensitive data with third parties for commercial purposes, in breach of the UK's data privacy laws. It says it included information about the ethnicity and sexual orientation of users. The claim alleges it mainly occurred before 3 April 2018, though the data was also shared between 25 May 2018 and 7 April 2020. It names data analytics companies Apptimize and Localytics as third parties which had access to the sensitive data. However, it says that a potentially unlimited number of third parties used the data to customise advertisements to Grindr's users. In addition, it is claimed that firms may then have retained some of the shared data for their own purposes. It emerged in 2018 that Grindr had been sharing personal data, including HIV status of users, with Apptimize and Localytics. Those companies were paid to monitor how people used the app in order to improve it. At the time, Grindr defended the practice, saying it was in line with industry standards – but it said it then stopped sharing HIV data with those companies. The firm said it had never sold the data to any advertisers. In 2021, the company was fined £5.5m by Norwegian authorities for breaking GDPR (EU general data protection regulation) rules. It was found to have shared user data, without seeking explicit consent, to third-party companies for the purpose of advertising. In 2022, Grindr was reprimanded by the UK's data watchdog over its data protection practices. The Information Commissioner's Office ruled that the company had failed to ""provide effective and transparent privacy information to its UK data subjects in relation to the processing of their personal data"".

206,Technology,From WhatsApp to Greggs - why is tech going down more?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxrz350qyy5o,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a304/live/8792db90-f278-11ee-b6f1-d3fc952ed49e.jpg.webp,"APRIL 20, 2024",Experts say tech outages do seem to be happening more often.,"What links Greggs, maker of the UK’s most popular sausage roll, and tech titans Apple and Meta? In March and April 2024, all have seen customers struggle to access some of their services - from baked goods, to Big Macs and WhatsApp messages – because of IT outages. Coincidence? Not according to experts, who say such outages now really are happening more frequently. These recent high-profile cases have thrust one particular website into the spotlight. Downdetector is a platform which monitors web outages - its data gives an idea of the extent of the problems companies have been facing recently. More than 1.75 million user-reported issues were flagged worldwide for WhatsApp on 3 April, according to the site. It says tens of thousands were also reported for the App Store and Apple TV. Neither firm responded to the BBC's questions about what had caused their outages. But Brennen Smith, vice-president of technology at Downdetector's parent company Ookla, says such instances reflect what they are seeing - which is more outages taking place and a higher number of reports from users as they happen. ""The internet is not exactly getting more stable,"" he told the BBC. To understand why, you need to understand a little more about the internet itself. Like software, it is composed of many layers. And every time regulators demand changes to platforms, consumers seek seamless access to data or investors push for buzzy new features like AI chatbots, new layers are added. Introducing more layers and complexity creates more risk of things going wrong. ""Right now there's a push for these mega giants to incorporate very game-changing new technology into their products and services,"" Mr Smith said. ""I think with the push for innovation now, we're going to start to see tech companies move faster [but] it comes at the risk of potentially breaking things."" The other thing to bear in mind with the internet: there are lots of different things that can make it fall over. Typos in code, faulty hardware, power failures and cyber attacks are just a few examples of why a service might go down. Even severe weather, such as heatwaves, storms and natural disasters can affect data centres - the huge halls housing powerful computers, known as servers, upon which online services rely. ""There are a lot of moving parts, and if just one of those goes wrong you can see problems,"" says Sam Kirkman of cyber-security firm NetSPI. Another issue is lots of firms have moved from managing their servers and infrastructure in-house to putting them on the cloud over the last decade. That has enabled those firms to do more ""faster than they ever could before"", Mr Kirkman told the BBC - but it also means a single outage in one place at the cloud service provider can ""cascade across a lot of the platforms, technologies and companies we use today"". Glitches for some of the biggest names in the industry - namely Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud - have previously led to downtime for thousands of customers. Even those impacting smaller, yet heavily relied-upon providers like Fastly and Cloudflare have also had a knock-on effect for services. The UK government's portal gov.uk was among major platforms knocked offline when Fastly had issues in June 2021. Sudden spikes in demand for a service can cause prolonged or complex outages, especially on high-traffic events like Black Friday or during low-staffed periods like bank holidays or weekends. Theories that Fridays see more outages than other days of the week may just be speculation, Mr Smith says. But he notes many firms do have policies not to ship updates or changes on them. ""Less humans have hands on keyboards, less eyes on monitoring systems. It's a time where you don't want to be rolling out changes,"" he says. IT glitches affecting Nationwide, McDonald's and Sainsbury's all took place on or began on Fridays in March, though they have been attributed to different causes. More widely, engineers trying to patch problems and get a service back online during outages can also find themselves contending with a stampede of users trying to get hold of it. Cloudflare said it encountered one of these so-called ""thundering herds"" when, during an outage stemming from a data centre power failure in November 2023, a slew of requests initially overwhelmed a recovery site. Underpinning all of this is another fundamental truth of the online world: while the services and products on offer grow ever more sophisticated, its basic architecture is, often, quite antiquated. In other words, the modern internet relies ""on a fabric of really old technology"", says Mr Kirkman. He highlights Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - one of the internet's most important in determining where traffic goes - as a good example, shown by Meta's six-hour outage in October 2021. Misconfigured BGP updates by Facebook meant it essentially stopped talking to the rest of the internet. And users of its platforms were likewise left unable to communicate with families or manage their businesses. Mr Kirkman says BGP represents an ongoing challenge because it has to be maintained, but cannot be easily updated and minor configurations can take down entire platforms. It highlights what he says some might consider ""technical debt"" as an issue potentially affecting the whole of the internet. These problems are not new. But our growing reliance upon online services means they are becoming an ever bigger challenge for firms seeking to prevent them. ""What really we're seeing is that people are caring more and more,"" says Mr Smith. ""I'd say now more than ever, it's really important that services are able to stay resilient to stay online and still bring new innovations and features to market,"" he adds. Copyright 2024 BBC.

207,Technology,Almost a quarter of kids aged 5-7 have smartphones,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68838029,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/12056/production/_123941837_gettyimages-1333622871.jpg.webp,"APRIL 19, 2024","The regulator calls the data a ""wake up call"", and says parents and industry need to do more.","Nearly a quarter of UK five-to-seven-year-olds now have their own smartphone, Ofcom research suggests. Social media use also rose in the age group over last year with nearly two in five using messaging service WhatsApp, despite its minimum age of 13. The communications regulator warned parental enforcement of rules ""appeared to be diminishing."" It also said the figures should be a ""wake up call"" for the industry to do more to protect children. In its annual study of children's relationship with the media and online worlds, Ofcom said the percentage of children aged between five and seven who used messaging services had risen from 59% to 65%. The number on social media went up from 30% to 38%, while for livestreams it increased from 39% to 50%. Just over 40% are reported to be gaming online - up from 34% the year before. Over half of children under 13 used social media, contrary to most of the big platforms' rules, and many admitted to lying to gain access to new apps and services. ""I think this is a wake up call for industry. They have to take account of the users they have, not the users that their terms and conditions say they have,"" Mark Bunting, from Ofcom's Online Safety Group told BBC News. ""We've known for a long time that children, under the age limit on a lot of the most popular apps, are widely using those apps, and companies are now under a legal obligation to take steps to keep those children safe,"" he added. Some campaigners want age limits to be introduced for smartphone use, and existing ones raised for social media. However it is already the case that most phones possessed by children are likely to have been provided by parents - under-18's cannot sign contracts, and most big operators say they do not sell pay-as-you-go phones to under-16's. Many parents give children phones because they want to be able to contact them or to track them via their mobile. How can you keep children safe online? Parents who spoke to the BBC also cited peer pressure, saying it was a struggle to keep children off social media when all their friends were a using an app. One parent said she felt ""pushed into a corner"". Heather Bryson who is 11 won wide recognition for her online exercise videos designed to help people in care homes during the pandemic, particularly those suffering dementia. She's had a smartphone since she was eight-years-old. Her parents feel she's benefited socially from being online, but what she does and who she communicates with are closely supervised. ""I think it's become an important tool for anyone growing up these days"", her father, Gary Bryson says. ""Being able to monitor exactly what she's doing is paramount"". Heather says it lets her talk with friends on social media and through message apps, but there are negatives. ""Sometimes I get boys swearing at me online in chats which is not nice, but the good things there are loads of nice people out there too"". ""It's just something that you get used to after a while but you shouldn't have to"", she says. Only a third of parents know the correct minimum age requirement for most social media platforms Ofcom suggests But the regulator said parents were also less willing to enforce the rules they knew about. Three in ten parents were willing to let a child aged 5-7 have a social media profile even if it was under the minimum age permitted for the apps, an increase compared to last year. Parents may be ""resigned"" to not being able to control children's online lives the new report notes. Mr Bunting said he had ""a lot of sympathy"" for parents on this issue: ""It may not be about preventing use entirely for children under 13, which I think is very difficult in today's society. But parents can talk to their children about using those services safely. And we'd encourage them to do that,"" he said. Some say investigations like that carried out by the BBC this month - which found that children as young as nine were added to a malicious WhatsApp group - mean further action is needed. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has previously suggested that he favours requiring app-stores to check the ages of users. Responding to the Ofcom report, Clare Fernyhough, of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, told the BBC that society had sleep-walked into ""just assuming that we all need a smartphone - and now we're beginning to see the huge impact that that's having"" But Professor Sonia Livingstone, Director of the Digital Futures for Children centre, said it was wrong to protect children by restricting their access to technology. ""This is the first generation with access to a powerful personal computer, it could be so amazing for them, and that's what children want too,"" she told the BBC. ""But the companies are risky by design, and what we need is child rights by design"", she said. Ofcom said new age limits for smartphones would be a matter for government. In May it will be consulting on the steps it expects tech firms to take to ensure children have safer experiences online, and later on new uses of AI to combat harmful content online. In a statement, the Secretary of State for Science, Technology and Innovation Michelle Donelan said protecting children online was the government's number one priority. ""Children as young as five should not be accessing social media and these stark findings show why our Online Safety Act is essential,"" she said. Does your young child have a smartphone?

208,Technology,Apple update addresses Jerusalem emoji controversy,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68831685,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8765/production/_133116643_gettyimages-1726926287.jpg.webp,"APRIL 26, 2024","A new software update stops the Palestinian flag emoji appearing when iPhone users type ""Jerusalem"".","Apple has released a partial update to its iPhone software which stops the Palestinian flag emoji being suggested when users type the word ""Jerusalem"". The issue had sparked controversy, with critics noting the names of other cities do not prompt flag emojis to appear. Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the ancient city. Apple previously told the BBC the flag's appearance when Jerusalem was typed had been inadvertent. The issue, according to Apple, related to unintended behaviour in a feature called predictive emoji. iPhones can suggest emojis when words are typed in messages, and other apps. Users noticed the flag started being suggested after the company rolled out iOS 17.4.1 - the latest publicly available version of the software on which its mobile devices run. Critics such as TV presenter Rachel Riley had demanded Apple explain why the flag appeared, particularly when other cities do not produce flag emojis when typed. ""Showing double standards with respect to Israel is a form of antisemitism,"" she wrote on social media. Apple's apparent resolution is currently only in the ""developer beta"" version of iOS 17.5 released on Tuesday. The Apple Developer Programme allows programmers building apps to sign up for early releases of the software - called beta versions - so they can test out apps they are building on them. In the new update no emoji is suggested when a user types ""Jerusalem"", in line with what happens with other cities. It's not clear when the update will be released more widely, either as a public beta, or as an finished update to the general public. The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest disputes in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel sees the whole of Jerusalem as its eternal, undivided capital, while Palestinians claim the eastern part as the capital of their hoped-for future state. East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in a war in 1967. They have since been viewed internationally as occupied Palestinian territory. There have been increased tensions in the Middle East since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. The subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed 33,729 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.
