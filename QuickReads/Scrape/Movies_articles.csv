University of Nottingham provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners Quentin Tarantino has reportedly scrapped what was supposed to be his tenth and final feature film, The Movie Critic, deep into pre-production. This decision is one in a long line of cancelled or unproduced projects left by the Hollywood wayside. For every film that makes it to our screens, hundreds if not thousands fail to make it – be it due to financial reasons, personal differences, or just the whims of the creatives involved. The following list offers a snapshot of some of these “shadow” films – and a tantalising glimpse of what might have been. The Barbie movie went through several iterations in the decade before its eventual release as Greta Gerwig’s billion-dollar 2023 behemoth. In a GQ article in 2023, Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody (Juno, Jennifer’s Body) discussed her time on the project, which she joined in 2014. She found it difficult trying to present a modern, feminist version of the character which was still identifiable as Barbie. “I didn’t really have the freedom then to write something that was faithful to the iconography,” Cody explained. “They wanted a girl-boss feminist twist on Barbie, and I couldn’t figure it out because that’s not what Barbie is.” Comedian Amy Schumer was cast as the lead, but left the project citing scheduling difficulties in 2017. Cody left the project the following year, having never completed a full draft of the script.

In The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made (2001), author David Hughes explains that Night Skies was envisioned as a leaner and meaner film. The initial treatment centred on a family’s farmhouse that is being stalked by malevolent aliens. By 1980, special effects creator Rick Baker was hired by Spielberg to create the extra-terrestrials, but this partnership ended in acrimony. While filming Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Spielberg found himself longing to go back to the “tranquillity” of Close Encounters. He entirely reconfigured the project, instead focusing on a kinder and gentler alien, encountered by a boy yearning for a friend. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was released in 1983, and Night Skies was confined to history as a fascinating “what-if”.

Developed by Universal and Working Title, Coppola eventually dropped out of the project a year later citing “creative differences”. However, in an interview in 2017, Coppola elaborated on why she left, citing the size of the project as a barrier to her creative control. “For me,” she explained, “when a movie has a really large budget like that, it just becomes more about business, or business becomes a bigger element than art.” This, coupled with the technical difficulties of realising her vision of shooting the film underwater, ultimately sank the project.

Lovecraft’s seminal horror work, At the Mountains of Madness (1931), directed by Guillermo Del Toro, produced by James Cameron, and starring Tom Cruise. What could go wrong? Within a year, however, the project was officially dead at Universal, who had baulked at the US$150 million (£121m) asking price for what would have been an R-rated film (meaning viewers under 17 would require an accompanying parent). Del Toro held out hope that the project could be revived. But the release of Ridley Scott’s Prometheus (2012) and its plot similarities to Mountains – a group of explorers uncovering the secret origins of man with horrifying consequences – ultimately put an end to this ambitious horror adaptation. Batgirl was announced in 2021, with Bad Boys for Life (2020) directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah signing on to direct. The cast included Brendan Fraser and Michael Keaton, alongside Leslie Grace as Batgirl. What sets Batgirl apart from any of the other projects on this list is that the film was in fact completed, and only cancelled deep into its post-production. Originally devised as a straight-to-streaming film for Warner Brothers’ fledgling streaming service HBO Max, a change in ownership and priorities saw the focus on streaming scrapped – with Batgirl paying the price. Warner decided to cancel and take a tax write-down on the US$70million (£56m) film, much to the dismay of many in the industry. The film was locked away, perhaps never to be released.

This includes films, TV shows, documentaries and even reality TV. But the road to get here hasn’t been easy. This is because Indigenous filmmakers, producers and artists have had to navigate the complex and often unfriendly terrain of Canadian media institutions and media production companies. But their negotiations — and struggles — over the past 30 years have helped make space for a new generation of Indigenous media makers now making shows and films on their own terms. These Indigenous creators increasingly have more decision-making power — and more control over how their stories get told as well as the ability to subvert old colonial representations. In a special episode of Don’t Call Me Resilient, recorded on-site with an audience in Vancouver at Iron Dog Books, we speak with Karrmen Crey, an expert on this new Indigenous media world. Crey speaks about the ways Indigenous creators are using humour along with a sharp critique of pop culture to show just how different the world looks when decision-making power over how stories get told shifts and Indigenous media makers take control. Crey, who is Stó:lō from Cheam First Nation, is an associate professor in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C. Her research focuses on Indigenously produced and created media in Canada and the media institutions that Indigenous people have had to navigate to produce their work. Crey is the author of Producing Sovereignty: The Rise of Indigenous Media in Canada. Crey says: I’m hoping that non Indigenous people are seeing [this new media] and not only registering it as being funny, but registering just how sharp and smart it is. There’s a lot of critical insight from those perspectives and I’m hoping it’s priming them to be more receptive and thoughtful about looking at things from Indigenous perspectives.

402,Movies,Challengers: new Zendaya tennis film reviewed by an expert in the psychology of competition,https://theconversation.com/challengers-new-zendaya-tennis-film-reviewed-by-an-expert-in-the-psychology-of-competition-228582,https://images.theconversation.com/files/589924/original/file-20240423-16-xt1gxw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=799%2C0%2C2063%2C2063&q=45&auto=format&w=240&h=240&fit=crop,"April 25, 2024",The Challengers fuses sex and sport to explore our competitive instincts.,"Senior Research Officer, University of Essex Sean Irving works at the University of Essex and receives funding from Leverhulme Trust  University of Essex provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners “Tennis is a relationship,” says Tashi Duncan (Zendaya) in director Luca Guadagnino’s new film Challengers. However, this relationship is not simply between the game and the player. Rather the heart of tennis, and perhaps of all competition, is a three-way relationship between two contestants and a third person. Their presence, and observation, is what gives competition its intensity. Challengers fuses sex and sport in a straightforward but effective way. Early on, at a junior tournament, we see friends Art Donaldson (Mike Faist) and Patrick Zweig (Josh O’Connor) fall in lust with tennis’s hot newcomer – Tashi. They’re good, but not great. Meanwhile, she’s all business, demolishing her opponents. The two boys compete for her attention and one night she ends up in their room, where they share a three-way kiss before she leaves. The match in the morning won’t play itself. Patrick wins the film’s first set and he and Tashi get together. Art, however, remains a “good friend”, religiously attending her games even when Patrick doesn’t. When Tashi’s playing career is ruined by an injury, he is there to support her. The two get married and she becomes his coach, the architect of his international success. Meanwhile, Patrick’s career remains in the doldrums, though he and Tashi maintain contact. When Art’s career also hits the buffers, she suggests he play the New Rochelle tennis tournament, at which Patrick will be waiting. What’s the point of all this competition? Tashi and Art are rich, thanks to their sporting success, but it’s clear that wealth doesn’t motivate them – and Art is nonplussed by the fandom that swirls around him. Perhaps it is the pursuit of excellence that drives them. This, however, is clearly not the case for ill-disciplined Patrick, who spends his time in bars and sleeping in his car, despite coming from an inordinately wealthy family. Art too seems ready to give everything up rather than ruthlessly recover his brilliance. Even Tashi, apparently the most dedicated and driven of the trio, is ready to risk professional excellence for an erotic thrill. In his 1903 essay, The Sociology of Competition, philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel argued that competition between two competitors is often aimed at impressing a third party. It is the presence of that third person that gives competition both its meaning and its intensity. Challengers can be viewed as a representation of precisely this three-way dynamic of competition. In the film’s erotic scenes, the desire for Tashi is conditioned by the sexual charge between Art and Patrick. She is attracted to them both at various times. Having apparently “won”, Art remains insecure about his status and the presence of Patrick. The borders between sporting and erotic competition are often blurred. “If you don’t win, I’ll leave you”, Tashi tells Art. Is her incitement to rivalry between the two purely strategic, a means of pushing Art to achieve better performance? It may be. Yet she seems to enjoy the attention of either one when it is on display for the other, be it on the court or in the bedroom. Any tension can only be held so long before one starts to tire, and it is as well that Challengers reaches its stylish pitch when it does. The film ends with a genuine display of affection between two of the characters. This might lead the audience to conclude that an intimate two-way relationship can transcend the competitive urge to perform for another. Yet the very public and performative nature of that moment leaves us wondering whether even reconciliation stems from the need to be wanted, and the desire to impress. Looking for something good?

University of Leeds provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners Warning: this article contains spoilers for Abigail. The horror film Abigail sets out to offer a new and refreshing perspective on the vampire tradition. Gone are the male Draculas of old and the fetishised lesbian vampires of the 2000s that haunted the vampiric horror genre in films like Jennifer’s Body (2009). Instead, the titular Abigail (Alisha Weir) is a young ballerina – the picture of childlike innocence. Child vampires are rare in film, though the commercial success of M3gan (2022), a horror film about an evil AI doll that looks like an eight-year-old girl, proved that monstrous young girls are a marketable film villain. In Abigail, a group of ragtag criminals kidnap a young girl (not knowing that she’s actually a bloodthirsty vampire) and hold her in a mansion in order to each receive a hefty payout. Though she appears to be a child, we soon learn Abigail is centuries old, and has developed a habit for “playing with [her] food” – this is a vampire hellbent on getting what she needs. The cast is stacked with familiar faces, headed by Scream (2022) star Melissa Barrera as recovering drug addict and medic Joey. Other stars include Angus Cloud as Dean, Kathryn Newton as ditsy hacker Sammy, and Dan Stevens as former detective Frank. The ensemble cast works well, adhering to the traditional horror trope of a group of strangers turned allies. Abigail has a lot of potential to offer its audiences: popular horror themes with a fresh twist in its child star. But none of the film’s strengths can outweigh its biggest weakness – its antiquated treatment of women. Between the bloodthirsty young ballerina and a group of criminals (most of whom have no issue harming Abigail even when they think she is a regular young girl) there’s little room to root for anyone. In having no clear protagonist, Abigail could have told an interesting and compelling story. But at a time when women in horror are finally becoming more complex (see so-called “good for her” films such as Midsommar and Ready or Not), Abigail’s treatment of its women characters is frustrating. In her role as Joey, Melissa Barrera continues her reign as a contemporary scream-queen – but she shines despite the writing, not because of it. Joey’s motivations and background are frequently overshadowed by the emphasis and importance placed on her maternal instincts. Joey is the only criminal who objects to hurting Abigail. She also takes the lead when it becomes apparent all is not what it seems. It is established she has a son, who she has abandoned, but her motherly instinct shows in her treatment and comfort of Abigail. Despite being assigned an androgynous nickname earlier in the film, Joey adheres to traditional feminine maternal behaviour. She forms a bond with Abigail, who is revealed to act out because of her absent father in unsuccessful bids for his attention. This supposed atonement for her previous lack of maternal instincts, in abandoning her son, is the reason that Joey is the only member of the criminal group to survive the film. Read more: What makes a film score frightening? Expert explains the techniques that build tension and make us jump Joey’s character adheres to the guidelines of the “final girl” trope (the final heroine left at the end of a horror movie). She remains sexually pure, rejecting the advances of another criminal. She defies gender roles through her nickname and her action-ready nature, leading the pack against Abigail. Yet the film seems to save her because of her feminine instincts and her desire to protect Abigail from harm. Joey being a maternal figure to Abigail isn’t an inherently negative plot point, but her survival hinging on it, and not her strength or mind, inextricably ties her value to her status as would-be mother. She does not save herself, whereas “final girls” generally emerge triumphant because of their determination. Joey gets to live because she cares for others – she has utilitarian purpose in a patriarchal world. When Abigail and Joey team up in the film’s final scenes to kill Frank, who is now a vampire, their success after an extensive fight scene is as close as the film comes to a feminist moment. But just as Abigail decides to let Joey leave, her vampire father (the film’s version of Dracula) arrives. This stunts any progressive female representation by introducing another dominant male figure moments after Frank was killed. Abigail has to beg her father to let Joey live, meaning the women of the film are once again held accountable to a man. Joey fails to take her place among final girls of past, such as Laurie Strode in the Halloween franchise and Sidney Prescott in the Scream series, because she wins her life not by brute force, but by following maternal instincts. I found Joey’s “reward” of life for her conformity to patriarchal ideas of how women should behave tiresome. This is a film that could have taken its place in the horror hall of fame, but instead ties itself up in its references to its classic horror roots, meaning it falls prey to gender standards of old.

The University of Edinburgh provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners The Beautiful Game is a film of second chances — where teams of homeless men and women from around the world find that all roads lead to Rome and everything’s to play for. Starring Bill Nighy as coach Mal, it follows the England team as they prepare for the Homelessness World Cup in Rome. At the last minute, Mal decides to bring with them a talented striker Vinny (Michael Ward), who could give them a chance at winning, but only if he’s ready to let go of his past and become part of the team. The Homelessness World Cup is a real football tournament and the film was made by the foundation responsible for the annual games. The idea for Homeless World Cup (HWC) Foundation emerged in 2001. It was created by The Big Issue, a magazine that supports homelessness, co-founder Mel Young and Austrian journalist Harald Schmied with the aim of transforming lives, creating opportunities and changing perceptions of homelessness. To date, HWC has helped 1.2 million homeless people through a network of more than 70 grassroots organisations in more than 70 countries. The Cities Ending Homelessness Report supported by HWC notes that along with interventions around housing, mental health and employment, HWC football is helping to change the narrative from managing the homeless problem to ending homelessness. As someone who has worked with people who have been helped by the tournament, I found the film captured the spirit, commitment and, in part, the remarkable story of the Homelessness World Cup. Last year’s tournament involved 400 players representing 40 countries and took place in Sacramento, California in the US. The teams competed in a week-long football tournament for seven prizes: four for the men’s competition and three for the women’s. The tournament marked 20 years of HWC and was won by Mexico’s women’s team and Chile’s men. An HWC survey found that 94% of players say the foundation has had a positive effect on their lives, 83% improved their relationship with families and friends and 77% say that HWC has changed their lives significantly and 76% continue to enjoy and play the sport. Many of the extras in the film had been helped by HWC. Bill Nighy told the BBCthat the best bit about being in the film was meeting the extras who had participated in the real tournaments and are now no longer homeless. As a sports academic, I have worked with HWC and spoken to many people who they have helped. In a journal article, my colleague Susan Ahrens and I sought to find out to what extent football could increase the capability of the homeless and those living on the street. We did so by focusing on how the Homeless World Cup and Street Soccer (Scotland) have affected the lives of some people. During this research, I spoke to people whose lives had been changed by competing. The stories I heard were about finding hope in sport. As one man told me: “It helped me mentally because I was starting to get depressed but the football and goal of HWC helped me feel more positive.” Others spoke of gaining purpose and control. “I want to feel like I have control in an aspect of my life again … At the moment soccer gives me this.” Many also said that the experience had given them hope for the future. “To me it [HWC] was a symbol of hope, determination, strength, and courage. It was the first time in my life I was proud to say I was an addict in recovery.” Our research found that interventions that start small can make a big difference. Football can contribute to non-football outcomes, such as reducing homelessness and building other skills such as team work and communication. The Beautiful Game echoes our research as it celebrates the power and potential of team sports for those who might feel pushed to the margins. We watch as Vinny refuses to relate to his team mates and to accept his homelessness. Playing as part of a team helps him to open up and be hopeful. Winning is not the real reward of playing in the HWC, it’s the interpersonal skills Vinny learns and the personal development he experiences.

University of East Anglia provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners This article contains spoilers for Sometimes I Think About Dying. Director Rachel Lambert’s sweet and sedate film Sometimes I Think About Dying frames suicidal thoughts as a strategy for survival. In the film, introverted office worker Fran (Daisy Ridley) takes solace in increasingly elaborate, surreal and aesthetic fantasies of her own death, including hanging from a crane, lying dead in the woods and being attacked by a python. But she isn’t seemingly suicidal. Or even depressed. She is isolated and lacking connection, but this seems to stem as much from choice as from social anxiety. Fran doesn’t want to conform to the social expectations she sees her colleagues awkwardly performing in order to fit in. The film begins with the retirement of likeable colleague, Carol (Marcia DeBonis) and pivots with the arrival of her replacement, Robert (Dave Merheje), who has relocated following a divorce. Affable Robert uses gentle humour to fit in to the workplace, but the moment when he reaches out to Fran on the work message board shows that he also seeks a deeper connection. Lambert understands the gendered nature of the pressures we feel and the strategies we adopt to fit in within social and work environments. Men are seemingly accepted more easily than women as being eccentric or laconic, as we see with several of Fran’s colleagues. Soon Fran and Robert go to the cinema and a restaurant for pie, but these don’t feel like dates, just the first steps in a tentative friendship. While Robert struggles to prise information from Fran about who she is and what she likes, the film’s fantasy sequences give us access to the complex and creative inner world into which she escapes in order to feel real. Lambert and Ridley really understand and connect with Fran’s psychology, and reveal it in a way that avoids either pathologising her or reducing her to a quirky indie movie cliche. Having recently completed a book on the historical interactions of psychiatry and cinema, I have watched a lot of films about young women quietly – and sometimes not so quietly – descending into “madness”. In films like Repulsion (1965), Images (1972) and Black Swan (2010), young female characters’ violent experiences of psychosis are exploited by male auteurs to confound and impress audiences and critics. The proliferation and persistence of this cinematic trend prompted the Canadian film critic Kier-La Janisse to class them as a specific “psychotic women” sub-genre. These films typically trigger flurries of psychological think pieces that ask questions such as: “What mental health problem has she really got?”. Lambert’s film is therapeutic rather than diagnostic. She doesn’t want Fran to change. Just to feel as comfortable being herself around other people as she is when she’s alone. The film concludes with Fran sharing her titular secret with Robert, opening up the possibility for understanding, intimacy and connection – for a more real friendship rather than a romance. As the film shows, the need for connection and intimacy is a universal human need rather than an individual mental health issue. As the recently retired Carol explains: “It’s hard being a person.” This is the simple but substantive message of the film. In one scene, Fran goes to buy doughnuts as a gesture of goodwill with the office and as an olive branch to Robert. In the cafe, she bumps into Carol. This is the film’s most poignant moment. Fran asks why Carol isn’t on the dream cruise with her husband that she had long saved for, and had retired to enjoy. Carol’s husband had a debilitating stroke on the eve of their trip, and now she is just waiting to see if he will ever recover. Carol had spent her working life dreaming about living, and this dream has been cruelly curtailed. In the film, dreams of living and dreams of dying are two sides of the same coin. They are alternate strategies for coping in a banal but uncertain world. Ultimately – as in Harold and Maude (1971), an older but similarly unconventional film making the connection between social isolation and thoughts of suicide – the protagonist’s dreams of dying are actually wishes for and a pathway towards connection, acceptance and freedom. Sometimes I Think About Dying concludes with Fran and Robert hugging in the office copy room, which has now been taken over by the forest floor upon which Fran had earlier fantasised about lying dead. Fran’s inner world and external reality have become aligned and alive through her sharing with Robert. The slow camera pan revealing Fran’s merged worlds is accompanied by With a Smile and a Song from Disney’s 1937 animation, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Lambert said the unusual but effective song choice was “found” by accident. It was initially suggested in jest by the editor, but they both then realised that it felt emotionally right. This final act of freeing yourself from expectations and doing what feels right is a fitting ending for this cliche-avoiding film. Looking for something good?

Copyright © 2010–2024, The Conversation"," In the film, introverted office worker Fran (Daisy Ridley) takes solace in increasingly elaborate, surreal and aesthetic fantasies of her own death, including hanging from a crane, lying dead in the woods and being attacked by a python. The film begins with the retirement of likeable colleague, Carol (Marcia DeBonis) and pivots with the arrival of her replacement, Robert (Dave Merheje), who has relocated following a divorce. Affable Robert uses gentle humour to fit in to the workplace, but the moment when he reaches out to Fran on the work message board shows that he also seeks a deeper connection. Men are seemingly accepted more easily than women as being eccentric or laconic, as we see with several of Fran’s colleagues."

View all partners When Amy Winehouse died at the age of 27 in 2011, many felt the world had been robbed of one its greatest stars who had barely shown us the extent of her talent. The new biopic Back to Black – directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and named after Winehouse’s seminal second album – attempts to make sense of her tumultuous life and musical output. The film follows Winehouse – played by Marisa Abela – from the early days of her career in early-2000s London, through to global stardom. In the process, it reveals the ways in which female celebrities are objectified in contemporary media and celebrity culture, even after their death. At the height of Winehouse’s fame, gossip tabloids still ruled the media. They created what became known as “trainwreck celebrities” – predominantly female stars who were portrayed as publicly promiscuous and frequently intoxicated. The most famous from this period include Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and Lily Allen. These female celebrities were regularly shamed in the tabloid and gossip press on both sides of the Atlantic. Winehouse shot to fame with her first album, Frank, in 2003, and was quickly considered one of these “trainwrecks” for being outspoken, performing intoxicated, and stumbling out of north London bars with her on-off lover and future husband, Blake Fielder-Civil. Throughout her life, Winehouse tried to resist this form of control and commodification. She was seen fighting with paparazzi and resisting rehab when her record company tried to get her help (she even wrote a song about it). Abela’s ability to imitate Winehouse’s voice and mannerisms is often impressive. However, while in the early stages Back to Black tries to counteract Winehouse’s tabloid image, it ultimately fails to shift this widely accepted narrative surrounding her chaotic lifestyle. The beginning of the film centres on Winehouse’s songwriting talent and musical performance, which is swiftly followed by the offer of a record contract. Abela’s Winehouse doesn’t tire of reminding her family and the viewer that she’s not in this for the fame or money. Indeed, the film both begins and ends with her telling us that all she wants is to make music that helps people forget their troubles, and only wants to be remembered for being a singer and for being herself. Winehouse’s distinctive personal style is central to the visual storytelling of the film. The singer became known for her trademark beehive and eyeliner, as well as a signature Fred Perry polo and skinny jeans combination. She was also known for wearing pink satin ballet flats, which gained notoriety in paparazzi photos that showed them bloodied in the public aftermath of a fight with her husband in August 2007. The film uses Winehouse’s distinctive style to communicate changes in her health. Instead of showing the unglamorous and often visually disturbing realities of bulimia and drug abuse, the progressively more torn clothes and dishevelled hair come to signify Winehouse’s physical and mental decline. Many of these style moments used in the film were not inspired by looks she wore in her performances, but instead were captured through paparazzi footage. While the use of these visuals amid the dramatised scenes serve as a reminder of the relentless media chase Winehouse had to endure, the film ultimately reinforces this sense of media exploitation. Rather than offering a complex visual portrayal that goes beyond the “trainwreck” images the viewer may be familiar with, Back to Black almost banks on how recognisable they are. It relies on the tabloid media’s damaging visual narrative instead of venturing to create its own. As a biopic, the film attempts to reclaim Winehouse from the victimhood often ascribed to her. However, the story it tells reduces Winehouse’s complex character and her life to a series of episodes of suffering. Take a scene set in the wake of her beloved grandmother’s illness and death. Winehouse’s husband is presented as the villain who exploits her trauma as a moment of weakness, to introduce her to the same hard drugs she rejected early on in the film. This sets Back to Black’s story on a familiar trajectory. In the film, her bulimia happens in the background, with scenes briefly showing Winehouse in front of the toilet. The only somewhat explicit discussion of it appears when her flatmate complains about the flushing noises that wake her up. These brief moments serve as markers of unhappiness, but offer no exploration of where this unhappiness may come from. They eschew the complexity of Winehouse and her mental health, and don’t offer more than the shallow broken artist shaped by tragedy and the love of a bad man – a narrative we already know. When Back to Black does look for causes of unhappiness, it settles on odd territory. At one point, it seems to suggest that her suffering stems from an unfulfilled desire to be a mother – a take that has garnered deserved criticism. Ultimately, Back to Black is unable to capture what made Winehouse so special: the grain of her voice, and her ability to craft stories of female experience that reject simplistic narratives of suffering.

View all partners One track on Taylor Swift’s new album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” honors a long-celebrated, oft-miscast heroine of American feminism: actress Clara Bow. As historians of the 1920s, we’ve studied Bow’s fame and her cultural legacy. At her ranch in rural Nevada, we oversee a collection of her personal artifacts, including her clothing and a makeup case. Bow was a woman way ahead of her time, a star who owned her success and her sexuality. There’s the popular perception that Bow was a victim of her own demons. But her story is anything but a cautionary tale. It is a victory march. Bow’s career got its start in her native New York, where in 1921, at the age of 16, she won a beauty contest and got a bit part in a film as her prize. Bow took every opportunity to be on set and learn the craft. She showed up early, stayed late and studied how to work with the cameras and lights. In a nascent film industry, Bow’s professionalism and graciousness defined her success. After she moved to Hollywood in 1923, Bow’s ability to steal a scene earned her a series of roles as a peppy sidekick in films such as “Dancing Mothers” (1926). The actress’s star turn happened in 1927’s “It,” in which she starred as a department store clerk who tries to woo her boss. Variety went on to dub Bow, who had become known for her trademark pout, flirty eyes and fiery red hair, Hollywood’s “hottest jazz baby.” Off the screen, a string of high-profile romances made her personal life fodder for the gossip pages. In 1926, Photoplay told readers that Clara “plays the reckless younger generation – on and off the screen,” noting that she kissed her boyfriend “so hard that his jaw was ‘sore for two days.’” Bow’s relationship with the press ran hot and cold. But the stories were unremitting. They ranged from studio-sponsored puff pieces in big trade publications to thinly sourced stories about orgies and abortions, published by small-time papers battling it out in Los Angeles’ cutthroat media environment. According to the press, Bow was plagued by “nervous breakdowns,” unlucky at love, and too brash for her own good. Her legions of fans loved her anyway. By 1929, she was receiving 45,000 fan letters a month. That same year, sales of the reddish dye henna tripled as fans tried to mimic her look. On set, she played cards, told rude jokes and doled out generous gifts, including an emerald-encrusted watch that she bestowed on one of her hairdressers. A century before Swift’s “Eras Tour,” Bow’s brand of American femininity – cocksure, adventurous, sexy – had real reach. In his 1981 memoir, producer Budd Schulberg wrote, “Millions of followers wore their hair like Clara’s and pouted like Clara, and danced and smoked and laughed and necked like Clara.” As powerful as Bow was in the late 1920s, she was largely powerless to direct her own career. Time and again, she signed lowball deals from male studio heads who demanded a nonstop production schedule. At the beginning of her career, her bosses at Preferred Pictures loaned her to other studios and pocketed her pay. They imposed rules and codes of conduct in her contracts to hem in her behavior. The demands of work were relentless. Exhausted, Bow told Motion Picture magazine in 1930, “People don’t know the studios are factories, that you get up at seven and work hard all day under uncomfortable conditions. People don’t know it because the studios don’t want them to know it.” Her family mooched. Maids stole. A friend-turned-personal assistant embezzled money and then sold her secrets to the press, sparking a scandal and trial. She had a gambling problem and mental health issues that reporters greedily chronicled. Bow ended up making 58 films in just over a decade. The studios owned her. Then she pulled the ultimate power move. She quit. In the early 1930s, Bow left Hollywood and moved to the Walking Box Ranch in rural Nevada, a 400,000-acre property owned by her husband, cowboy film star Rex Bell. The press was unaware of her whereabouts. Some colleagues wondered if her Brooklyn accent had done her in with the arrival of talkies, or if she had experienced another breakdown. In reality, she had fallen in love. She said of Rex, “He’s given me the only unselfish devotion I have ever had.” Together, they raised two sons. He stayed in Nevada and moved on to a career in politics. Although they never divorced, Bow eventually returned to California, where she spent her later years living quietly in Santa Monica with her black poodle, Angel. She read voraciously, a habit fueled by her lifelong insomnia. She loved to decorate for Christmas. It turns out, Bow was not a victim of her time. She wasn’t pushed out of film because talkies exposed her Brooklyn accent. Nor was she shunned by Hollywood society for the ever more scandalous stories that emerged. She simply left and, for the most part, didn’t look back. As to her reputation as a recluse, her eldest son, Rex Bell Jr., said, “She wasn’t near as reclusive as people thought.” She hid behind scarves and glasses, “hoping people wouldn’t recognize her,” but when they did, “they’d walk up and say, ‘You’re Clara Bow, aren’t you?’” Of his mother’s fame, he remembered, “She was always nice to people. She really was.” Her legacy as a figurehead of American feminism is accurate, if incomplete. Bow came to the fore of American culture at a time when Hollywood’s nascent studio system developed the formula for selling sex. In the late 1920s, the press realized celebrity gossip sold papers, and the personal lives of actors and actresses were fair game. Realizing that any attention is good attention, studio executives embraced the media’s sensational coverage of Bow’s implied abortions or mental health issues. Taylor Swift and Clara Bow have much in common: a meteoric rise to fame built on talent and hard work; a series of closely watched love affairs; and legal drama with managers, former friends and the press. Both women redefined expectations of what an American woman could – and should – be. In 2019, in the midst of a dispute with her former label, Big Machine Records, Swift decided to rerecord her prior records and rebrand them as “Taylor’s Version” in order to regain ownership of her music. There was no “Taylor’s Version” for Bow. But her choice to leave Hollywood ended up being a middle finger to the men whom she had made rich and powerful. Now, Swift is bringing Bow back into the spotlight for an encore – and for a new generation of fans to appreciate.

University of Essex provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners The point-of-view (POV) shot is a filming angle that is usually used to put the viewer into the rigid perspective of how a character sees the world, either for a few scenes, or in some cases, the whole film. Used well, it can be extremely effective, presenting an entirely new way of looking at a character or their motivations. This can be very useful for filmmakers depicting difficult characters, like murderers, machines or monsters. Here are five films that have used POV to depict difficult or inorganic characters in convincing ways. James Cameron’s classic dystopian sci-fi film is about a cold killing machine hunting a woman to win a future war. Viewers learn early into the film that the killer cyborg (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) “can’t be reasoned with” and “doesn’t feel pity, remorse or fear”. At several points, we are shown events through the eyes of the mechanical killer – witnessing the world through its confined lens. A red filter replaces natural colours, while numeric data and targeting systems remind us of the unnatural objectives programmed into this machine. Viewers do not inhabit the cyborg’s gaze for long, but experience it often enough to differentiate between the war on humanity as seen from killer robotic eyes and everybody else’s. Robocop (1987) later took this format and added an element of victimhood to it, using POV to signify a character who had human vulnerability mixed in with their mission as synthetic executioner. Julian Schnabel’s biographical drama about Jean-Dominque Bauby’s experience of locked-in syndrome is a harrowing film of vulnerability told through a single working eye. Bauby wrote his memoir (of the same name) using the only part of his body that he could control, his left eye. Using structured blinking patterns and a complex alphabetical chart, his eye became his only means of communication. Schnabel’s film uses POV to present the extreme discomfort of this condition. Lopsided imagery of medical staff, therapists and loved ones enter our vulnerable and immobile gaze, flooding our field of vision without warning. The camera movement used is ironically more active than most POV films, as shots rapidly scan the room with intermittent blackouts to emphasise blinking and optical hysteria. In one of the most difficult scenes, an operation is carried out on the right eye to seal it shut. A piece of latex covers the lens, making the viewer feel and experience the pain of each stitch. Michael Powell’s darkly controversial film about voyeurism and scopophilia (the pleasure of looking) brought his directorial career to a premature conclusion in 1960. The film’s subjects – sex, trauma and murder – were met with scathing critique from audiences who were not yet ready for such themes, particularly from a director who made more palatable films like The Red Shoes (1948) or A Matter of Life and Death (1946). Peeping Tom opens with a two-minute unbroken POV sequence in which camera-obsessed Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhn) approaches a sex worker while covertly filming her. Following her up to her flat, he murders her with a concealed phallic spike protruding from the camera apparatus. The Freudian message is clear, as too is the challenging way that Powell lambasts viewers for watching. Lewis explains that his obsession is a consequence of his own father (played by Powell) constantly training a camera on him, allowing the killer and victim gaze to overlap. However, the opening sequence is purely killer vision, shown through a viewfinder reminiscent of a hunting rifle, as predator stalks its prey. POV is used in the first third of Delmer Daves’s experimental thriller to tell the story of escaped convict Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart), who is arrested for murder. After Parry’s escape, we learn that he has been framed. In order to clear his name, he undergoes plastic surgery with a sadistic doctor. His vulnerability is emphasised through the use of POV. The doctor looks down on us and cuts the viewer during a POV shot. As Parry’s new identity heals, so the spectator has the opportunity to look at him rather than through him. He is no longer a killer or victim but rather an innocent hero setting forth to clear his name, embodied in the guise of charismatic Bogey. Spike Jonze’s experimental film adopts POV scenes to give viewers a unique way to experience everyday life as a passenger inside the head of an unsuspecting John Malkovich. Awkward puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) discovers a portal to Malkovich’s subjectivity and hacks in permanently to make up for his own shortcomings in his failed life. POV is used to emphasise Schwartz’s awkwardness, which is a recognisable trait within other films and television programmes. The sitcom Peep Show (2003-15) frequently incorporated this shot style into early episodes, to show the awkward perspectives of its two misfits, Jeremy (Robert Webb) and Mark (David Mitchell). And Mike Nichols’s The Graduate (1967) uses an extensive POV shot during a pool scene from anxious protagonist Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) to emphasise his sense of isolation. The final scene of Jonze’s film, also at a swimming pool, is hauntingly reminiscent of Braddock’s alienation as Schwartz is left trapped and forlorn, imprisoned in a POV gaze that he can no longer control.

She has previously received research funding from NIHR.  King's College London provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Content warning: this article discusses mental health, addiction and eating disorders. Back to Black is a new biopic about the life of musician Amy Winehouse. It covers the time from when she gets her record deal aged 18, until her tragic death from alcohol poisoning in 2011 at the age of 27. Ahead of the film’s release, reactions to promotional material suggested the critical response could be mixed. This was borne out in early reviews, which ranged from resoundingly positive to somewhat scathing. Others have and will discuss the filmmaking, musical performances and storytelling, or compare Back to Black’s retelling against existing accounts of Winehouse’s life. As someone who researches alcohol and its effects, I was interested in how Winehouse’s addiction to alcohol and other substances would be portrayed. Winehouse died in 2011 of alcohol poisoning and an inquest into her death found that she had a blood alcohol level of 0.416. This level of intoxication is life threatening, and is associated with loss of consciousness and suppression of vital life functions. The film focuses on Winehouse’s (Marisa Abela) relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil (Jack O'Connell). His substance use is first shown in opposition to Winehouse’s (him: “cokehead”, her: “drinker”), but their behaviour come to mirror each other. Fielder-Civil talks about “toxic codependence” in one scene, when Winehouse visits him in prison. More striking than the codependency, though, is the lack of agency Winehouse seems to have despite her talent and success. In her relationships with Fielder-Civil and her father (Eddie Marsan) she is almost deferential. Her manager and label hold power over her career. But most shocking of all is how normal life is made impossible by the intrusiveness of the paparazzi. Alcohol is present in the film from the first scene, a family party that introduces us to Winehouse’s close relationship with her nan, Cynthia (Lesley Manville). Before it becomes an overt part of the storyline, viewers are given clues about Winehouse’s relationship with alcohol. She is shown drinking neat vodka in a pub with her soon-to-be manager, drinking a murky-looking “Rickstasy” (Southern Comfort, vodka, Bailey’s and banana liqueur) cocktail alone the day she meets Blake Fielder-Civil for the first time. In one scene she tells her nan that she’d had “a couple of drinks” for courage before appearing on the Jonathan Ross show. Less clearly signposted, however, are her concurrent mental health problems. It is well documented that Winehouse experienced mental health difficulties including depression and bulimia. There is a strong link between substance use and mental health problems and they often coexist. The filmmakers’ choice not to show Winehouse’s other mental health problems too heavily is arguably a fair one, as the director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, has said she wanted the film to “joyfully honour” Winehouse. But the result is that Winehouse’s relationship with alcohol and other substances lacks nuance on the screen. There is extensive research on how social stressors, parental conflict, interpersonal trauma and complicated grief are related to substance use. Viewers are reminded of what Winehouse has lost or does not have (her parents’ marriage, Fielder-Civil, her nan, a baby), in ways that validate the notion of “drinking to cope” or self-medication. Most of us understand the idea of self-medicating intuitively. But depictions of it on screen should not be too simplistic. Research into post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol use disorder found there was a lack of good evidence for the self-medication model. Alcohol use and mental health also have relationships that go in both directions, with evidence that mental health drives alcohol use and vice versa. Towards the end of the film, Winehouse’s request to go to rehab comes as a rapid acceleration through the psychologists’ classic “stages of change” theory of behaviour, which claims that people move through six stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance and termination. We see little of her time in rehab, and while we later get a sense of the chronic and relapsing nature of addiction, viewers are left to fill in the blanks at the end. On the whole, while Back to Black succeeds in avoiding harmful and stigmatising representations of addiction and mental health problems, viewers don’t get a deep insight into the realities and complexities of addiction.

University College Cork provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners In March 2024, Japanese film fans celebrated what would have been the 100th birthday of one of Japan’s most popular female film stars, Hideko Takamine (1924-2010). Many of Takamine’s roles captured the essence of 20th-century Japanese society in flux, challenging and redefining what it means to be a woman through the decades. Her performances are like time capsules, offering insights into the changing roles and expectations of women in a rapidly evolving Japan. They are compelling portraits by an artist whose work was closely linked to the upheavals of the 20th century. These six films – some well-known, some more obscure – highlight the richness of her career, which spanned 50 years and more than 180 films. In a fascinating blend of grit and optimism, this film showcases the complications of life in Tokyo just after the end of the second world war. As a tomboyish aspiring artist in dungarees, Takamine represents a new idea of Japanese women exploring creative freedom after the war. Through her decision to abandon her beloved canvas and paints, joining a musical troupe that toured the cafés and night clubs of Tokyo’s Ginza district, the film symbolises Takamine’s own journey. In this reborn Japan, her bold act of taking agency carved out her place as an artist. As an early post-war example of media-mix marketing, a record of Takamine singing the catchy title song was released at the same time. The film marks a significant milestone in Takamine finding her voice in postwar Japan. Takamine takes the starring role in Japan’s first colour film. With vibrant dance scenes, Takamine questions traditional gender norms in her role as a striptease dancer. Navigating the contradictory expectations and ideas of womanhood, her performance masterfully encapsulates the cultural and moral dilemmas faced by Japanese women during the postwar era. Striptease in Japan was widely tolerated and even supported by the American occupation forces and is sometimes discussed as a marker of female freedom. But when Takamine’s character returns to her rural home, the film comically depicts the utter confusion of the people in her village. Is she a representative of the new age or just a glamorised sex worker? This poignant antiwar film cast Takamine in perhaps her most famous role – as a primary school teacher witnessing the devastating impact of militarism and war on her students in rural Japan. Takamine’s heartrending portrayal, grappling with the moral quandaries of wartime, deeply moved its audience. While its exclusive focus on Japanese victimhood has been highlighted by film critics including Sato Tadao, a pioneer in the research of Asian films, the open depiction of Japanese suffering was novel after years of American postwar censorship. This novelty, along with the film’s use of nostalgic music, goes a long way to explaining the film’s impact. Takamine’s transformation from youthful educator, shocking the rural people riding a bicycle to work (how unladylike…), to a broken woman in mourning is unforgettable. Takamine delivers a powerful performance as Keiko, a widowed bar proprietor navigating the complexities of running a hostess bar on her own. Keiko struggles financially, but what are her options? Giving in to her male customers, waving their wallets around while they vie for her affection and her body? Should she start a new business altogether? Or get remarried, possibly to one of the more decent looking regulars? Takamine’s own persona as a film star, finding her own way as an independent woman without relying on a man’s money, is intertwined with Keiko’s story. This is what gives the film its authentic power. It’s one of Takamine’s most haunting performances – and a strong warning to her fans never to rely on a man. Takamine was married to screenwriter Matsuyama Zenzō in 1955. The marriage fitted her developing persona and was celebrated as a partnership between equals. The groom was far from being a good catch financially for the film star. The Happiness of Us Alone was Matsuyama’s debut as a director, and this collaboration was a manifestation of their artistic partnership, with the film celebrating marital love. Portraying a deaf couple’s struggle against postwar societal challenges, the film delves into disability and social inclusion. Takamine’s commitment to authenticity, demonstrated by her learning sign language for the role, adds a layer of depth and empathy to this powerful story. By 1967, Takamine was a seasoned veteran in front of the camera. And in The Wife of Seishu Hanaoka, she skilfully deploys her talents to show the darker side of the human soul – and the sacrifices some women are ready to make for men’s affections. Takamine plays the jealous mother of a historical Edo period surgeon, embroiled in rivalry with her daughter-in-law for his affection. They go so far as to offer themselves as human guinea pigs for his often-terrifying experiments with anaesthesia and appear willing to sacrifice their health and even their lives for his success. Takamine’s chilling depiction of determination and contempt for her daughter-in-law remains unsettling to this day. Men in Japan often remain the sole breadwinners for their families, making their success critical for the family and relegating the women to a background role. These six films represent just a small fraction of Hideko Takamine’s wide-ranging oeuvre, but together provide a fascinating insight into her acting prowess and the themes running through her work. Takamine was an iconic artist whose work reflected and shaped womanhood in 20th century Japan. In the year of her 100th birthday, these powerful and authentic performances are ripe for rediscovery and deserve to be more widely seen outside Japan. Looking for something good?

Copyright © 2010–2024, The Conversation"," View all partners In March 2024, Japanese film fans celebrated what would have been the 100th birthday of one of Japan’s most popular female film stars, Hideko Takamine (1924-2010). Many of Takamine’s roles captured the essence of 20th-century Japanese society in flux, challenging and redefining what it means to be a woman through the decades. As a tomboyish aspiring artist in dungarees, Takamine represents a new idea of Japanese women exploring creative freedom after the war. Through her decision to abandon her beloved canvas and paints, joining a musical troupe that toured the cafés and night clubs of Tokyo’s Ginza district, the film symbolises Takamine’s own journey. Navigating the contradictory expectations and ideas of womanhood, her performance masterfully encapsulates the cultural and moral dilemmas faced by Japanese women during the postwar era."

View all partners Seventy years after his first appearance in the 1954 Japanese film Gojira, Godzilla has become a global star. Meanwhile King Kong, his gigantic Hollywood counterpart, has been circling the globe for a shade over 90 years. The two come together  in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire for the second time in the MonsterVerse film franchise, this time as unlikely partners protecting the Earth. Godzilla’s globalisation began early in the character’s life. In 1956, Gojira was remade, with new scenes starring Canadian actor Raymond Burr as a US journalist explaining the film’s action to American audiences. The local and transnational politics of the Godzilla franchise have been mutating ever since. Godzilla began as an post-war destroyer of human cities like Tokyo, but over time the character has shifted, occasionally becoming humanity’s protector, an eco-warrior and even (infamously) a father in Son of Godzilla in 1967. The MonsterVerse films, which began with Godzilla in 2014 have replayed as many of the Japanese franchise’s main themes as it has remixed and amplified them. Across five films, the MonsterVerse has emerged as slick, well-defined giant monster mythos that has further globalised Godzilla – and King Kong along with him. Read more: Why Godzilla is the perfect monster for our age of environmental destruction In the original Japanese film, Godzilla is awakened by American atomic bomb testing in the Bikini Atoll. He represents a warning about the dangers of nuclear power. But by contrast, in the MonsterVerse, nuclear power stations and bombs are used routinely to “power up” Godzilla. This is taken to new extremes in Godzilla x Kong. Godzilla not only absorbs the nuclear radiation from a power plant, but also turns quasi-cannibal, killing the sea-serpent Titan Tiamat to absorb its power. This extra dose of radiation results in a radical new look. Each of the Titans (ancient gigantic creatures) in the MonsterVerse has its own colour scheme. Tiamat’s signature colour is pink, and so for the second half of Godzilla x Kong, Godzilla shines with rosy radioactive hues. The MonsterVerse has added the idea of the “Hollow Earth” to bolster Godzilla’s murky origin story. Hollow Earth is a longstanding myth about a world existing inside our own, which has been the subject of conspiracy theories. In the MonsterVerse, the Hollow Earth is a pre-modern landscape filled with Titanic creatures. In Godzilla x Kong, King Kong is in Hollow Earth searching for his lost species. In this way the film is something of a sequel to director Adam Wingard’s 2021 Godzilla vs Kong. In it, Kong discovers an enslaved giant ape community near the heart of the Hollow Earth, under the control of the Skar King. The Skar King is another giant ape who controls Shimo, the Titan whose icy breath brought on the last ice age. Defeated and badly injured in his initial attempt to free this giant ape community, Kong turns to his human friends from Monarch (the subject of Apple TV’s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters) for help. In a nod to the popularity of the Transformers franchise, Monarch provides Kong with an exoskeletal arm with which to fight the Skar King. When Kong and Godzilla finally come together they make inventive use of the Hollow Earth’s passageways. Ever since Godzilla began travelling these tunnels to destroy global cities like San Francisco (in the franchise’s first film), the MonsterVerse filmmakers have been carefully selecting famous global cities for the Titans to use as wrestling rings. In Godzilla x Kong alone, Godzilla’s battles take place in Rome, Egypt and the Arctic. The Skar King’s obsession with the surface world brings him eventually to Rio de Janeiro. The city is burned, frozen and stomped on as Godzilla and Kong face off against their enemies. There is humour in these battles, in which familiar tourist destinations are ripe for destruction. Among the beloved national landmarks reduced to rubble is the Coliseum, which becomes a giant cat bed for Godzilla. But, there is also an industrial logic to the way the locations are being selected. The Chinese-owned production company, Legendary Pictures, are working with their American studio partner, Warner Brothers, to maximise the MonsterVerse’s global appeal by taking a global approach to these battlegrounds. Through these familiar cities, the MonsterVerse films are carefully targeted to audiences from across the globe. And, the opening weekend’s blockbuster box office shows that this strategy is paying off. It can even be seen in the transnational casts. Previous instalments of the franchise have featured major international stars like Ken Watanabe, Juliet Binoche and Ziyi Zhang, balanced out by Hollywood stars like Brian Cranston and Millie Bobby Brown. Aside from the Titans, Godzilla x Kong is largely populated by secondary characters from previous films, along with broadly drawn characters like Trapper, a dentist and vet for Titans (Dan Stevens on scene-chewing form). This is where the young Jia, played with graceful poise by Kaylee Hottle, comes into her own. Jia is the lone survivor of the Iwi people of Skull Island (wiped out in an off-screen Titan disaster). Hottle, a rising star, is a deaf performer, and provides a signed, subtle performance that supplies the film’s heart. However, in Godzilla x Kong it seems like the Titans are finally the main attraction in their own movies. As Godzilla and Kong make themselves at home in semi-flattened cities all over the world, the global power of the MonsterVerse is hard to argue with. Looking for something good?
