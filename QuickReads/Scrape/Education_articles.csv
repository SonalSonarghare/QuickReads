300,Education,14 Essential Reads for New Teachers,https://www.edutopia.org/article/essential-books-new-teachers,"https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hero_feature_New-Teachers_Education-Trends_New-Teachers_Book-Collage.jpg?resize=220,150.92000000000002&quality=85","February 2, 2024",We asked educators in our community to share the most important books they’d recommend to the next generation of teachers. Here are their top picks.,"When math lecturer Howie Hua is working with his students—future elementary school teachers—he often talks about the power of giving yourself grace. “Is it kind of ridiculous to be asked to get it right on the first try?” he asks. “Whatever it is, you’re going to need patience with your learning. You don’t give up. You don’t say, ‘Well, I fell trying this new skill, so I guess I’m not meant to do gymnastics.’ It’s important to help students embrace that and embrace the learning journey.” This is also true for educators—especially new teachers. The early years in every teacher’s career are peppered with firsts—from navigating classroom management hurdles to establishing routines and procedures that work for a room filled with students of varying backgrounds and identities. New teachers often feel a strong desire to be flawless, to walk into the classroom and do all things perfectly. But it’s OK to make a misstep, to fall and pick yourself up again, because it’s all part of the process of working toward getting it right. Generations of educators have walked that same path—and many have documented their experiences of exactly what worked and what didn’t. We asked our community to share the books they would recommend as most important to new teachers—the books that helped guide them, shape their pedagogy, challenge their perspectives, and motivate them. Over 100 titles were suggested—including some that surprised and delighted us, like educator Lily Crull’s comment on Instagram that she reads “at least 5–6 new” young adult books that her students recommend each year. Classics like Harry and Rosemary Wong’s bestseller The First Days of School made an appearance, while some more recently published titles were heavily nominated as well: Bettina Love’s 2023 offering Punished for Dreaming easily made it into our final list. These 14 titles represent the topics that resonated most deeply with our audience. There’s no need to read all of them in the span of a year—much less before you ever set foot in the classroom. Consult them throughout your teaching journey as you grow into your role.

Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain: Promoting Authentic Engagement and Rigor Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students by Zaretta Hammond
You won’t find a list of tips and tricks within this book. Hammond probes at the very nature of the term culturally responsive teaching: interrogating what it means philosophically, dissecting its nuances, and examining the impact of this work on students’ brains. Designed to prompt self-reflection and action, Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain empowers educators in diverse classrooms to begin intentionally bolstering engagement and fostering deeper learning in a way that honors students and their identities. The First Days of School: How to Be an Effective Teacher by Harry and Rosemary Wong
Almost 30 years after its publication, this teacher-focused how-to manual currently in its fifth edition remains a “must-read,” according to our audience. Though much has changed in the school system since then, the book’s insights on evidence-based practices of high-functioning classrooms and the importance of establishing procedures and routines stand the test of time. Some critics argue that the authors’ approach to classroom management may “stifle spontaneity in classrooms and lead teachers to become overly controlling,” so consider taking the sections that don’t resonate with you with a grain of salt. Cultivating Genius: An Equity Framework for Culturally and Historically Responsive Literacy by Gholdy Muhammad
Steeped in the historical context of 19th-century Black literary societies, Muhammad’s Cultivating Genius presents a piercing exploration of current literacy practices and pedagogy. The book’s backbone is her equity framework, ""Historically Responsive Literacy,” which focuses on four “learning pursuits”: criticality and students’ intellectual, skill, and identity development. These learning pursuits, when taught in tandem, she writes, create the foundation of an ecosystem where students from all backgrounds—especially those that have been historically marginalized—can thrive and achieve academic success. The book’s aim is to foster a smarter, more self-aware, and more discerning next generation of young readers and thinkers. Grading for Equity: What It Is, Why It Matters, and How It Can Transform Schools and Classrooms by Joe Feldman
Grading isn’t always a topic of discussion in teacher preparation programs, Feldman writes, leaving many new teachers with little insight on how to set up an equitable system for their students. Grading for Equity offers an implementation road map toward ensuring accuracy, preventing bias and subjectivity, and presenting a dynamic picture of academic performance—all plotted by a 20-year veteran teacher, principal, and district administrator. The recently published second edition zooms in on the impacts grading can have on students’ mental health, as well as the role the Covid-19 pandemic played in changing perceptions around traditional grading. Building Thinking Classrooms in Mathematics, Grades K–12: 14 Teaching Practices for Enhancing Learning by Peter Liljedahl
Can you tell if your students are actually thinking or just taking notes and mimicking what they see? With the help of over 400 K–12 teachers, Liljedahl—a professor of mathematics education—spent more than a decade pinpointing the qualities of a high-functioning math classroom. It all comes down to 14 key variables, including where students work, how groups are formed, the quality of assessments, and the types of tasks used and how they are given to students. As one reviewer put it, this book doesn’t simply identify common problems in math classrooms but provides intentional, actionable takeaways and next steps. The First Six Weeks of School by Responsive Classroom
The First Six Weeks of School is a blueprint for those crucial initial days in the K–6 school year—it’s like having a seasoned mentor teacher in your back pocket. Alongside sample schedules, each chapter encompasses a week’s worth of time-specific suggestions like how to set up the flow of the day and how to create and maintain high expectations for behavior. From welcoming a new student to setting up a substitute teacher for success, this book shows teachers how to handle each new scenario with ease. Punished for Dreaming: How School Reform Harms Black Children and How We Heal by Bettina Love
A searing and unflinching examination of over four decades’ worth of prejudice and racism in education reform, as well as its disastrous legacy for generations of Black and Brown children. Love interviewed 25 Black Americans whose lives were forever changed by policies that spanned from Ronald Reagan’s presidency to the Obama administration, and the book seamlessly traces the impact of those policies into the present day. Ultimately, Love asks—and answers—the questions: What price did these people pay? And how can we prevent children from suffering the same fate in the future? Teach Like a Champion 3.0: 63 Techniques That Put Students on the Path to College by Doug Lemov
The third edition of Lemov’s Teach Like a Champion is an “expanded and up-to-date revision” of his original comprehensive overview of more than 60 teaching techniques that set students up for success. Lemov walks teachers through the right ways to phrase and ask questions, how to check for understanding, the best ways to motivate and encourage active participation, how to ensure that students retain material, and more. Readers particularly enjoy the over 100 accompanying videos found online, which showcase actual teachers implementing Lemov’s strategies in their classrooms. The Knowledge Gap: The Hidden Cause of America’s Broken Education System—and How to Fix It by Natalie Wexler
Education journalist Wexler embarks on a thoughtful and thorough trek through history and research, arriving at an in-depth critique of skills-based literacy curricula. With an eye toward equity, she urges schools to reconsider the ways they teach elementary students of diverse backgrounds to read—and she shares accounts from classrooms where educators are doing just that. Wexler characterizes this book as a criticism not of teachers but of a system that has become strikingly resistant to change. Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom by bell hooks
In this collection of essays on the intersections between education and politics, race, class, and gender, hooks takes ample inspiration from Brazilian educator and philosopher Paulo Freire, whose seminal text also made this list. Rethink the role of the student and teacher, hooks says, by engaging in the deeply vulnerable work of self-reflection and scrutiny. And hooks does this herself, recounting memories of her identity as both student and teacher. One reviewer on Goodreads explains that this isn’t the sort of book you read once and put back on your shelf—instead it reveals itself to you in layers each time you revisit it. Readicide: How Schools Are Killing Reading and What You Can Do About It by Kelly Gallagher
“Readicide,” which Kelly Gallagher defines as “the systematic killing of the love of reading,” is the unintentional outcome of many common teaching strategies. If you want your students to read more and actually enjoy doing so, he suggests taking a good hard look at the practices you employ in your classroom. Are you asking students to read challenging texts without instructional support? Is there space in your classroom for recreational reading, or are only academic texts prioritized? Gallagher provides practical ways to make reading enjoyable for students. Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire
The educational landscape of today is very unlike the one Freire spoke about back in 1968 when this was originally published, but the need for a critical look at our pedagogical systems remains as salient now as it was then. Perspectives on knowledge, access, education reform, and class are heavily colored by Freire’s experiences with poverty in Brazil, as well as his work with marginalized communities—many of whose members could not read. Freire speaks neither of a “sage on the stage” nor a “guide on the side” model, instead articulating one where teachers view themselves as active participants in learning from their students and view their students as sharers of valuable insights to teach. Book Love: Developing Depth, Stamina, and Passion in Adolescent Readers by Penny Kittle
Reluctant readers are an unfortunate reality of any English classroom, no matter the age or grade. So what to do when students simply won’t engage with assigned texts, or even pick up a book for fun? Kittle—a seasoned teacher and literacy coach—shares a mixture of inspirational and personal anecdotes balanced with clear and concise strategies to help start students on their personal reading journey. Whether you’re trying to build an engaging classroom library or revamping your instructional efforts to better support struggling readers, Book Love will breathe new life into your practice. The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life by Parker Palmer
As you develop your unique teacher identity—who you are and how that relates to being an educator—Palmer walks the same philosophical path. Reflecting on his own time teaching, Palmer doesn’t focus just on the motivational “heart” side of the work; he also explores ways to safeguard against burnout, demonstrates the importance of fostering connections with students, and explains why “good teaching cannot be reduced to technique alone.” The advice may be, as some reviewers on Goodreads claim, abstract rather than immediately actionable, but it could be a dose of encouragement just when you need it."," You don’t say, ‘Well, I fell trying this new skill, so I guess I’m not meant to do gymnastics.’ It’s important to help students embrace that and embrace the learning journey.” This is also true for educators—especially new teachers. Over 100 titles were suggested—including some that surprised and delighted us, like educator Lily Crull’s comment on Instagram that she reads “at least 5–6 new” young adult books that her students recommend each year. Classics like Harry and Rosemary Wong’s bestseller The First Days of School made an appearance, while some more recently published titles were heavily nominated as well: Bettina Love’s 2023 offering Punished for Dreaming easily made it into our final list."
301,Education,In the News: Do Classroom Expectations Affect Student Performance?,https://www.edutopia.org/article/blog-classroom-expectations-student-performance-weekly-news,No image found,"September 24, 2012",,"Last week, several thought-provoking studies made the news. Here's a look at a few studies and other interesting stories -- including a school district that pays for college, a case for why Wikipedia should be used in the classroom, and a look at how high-stakes testing can encourage cheating. When test scores don't improve and teachers are required to return bonuses, what affect does that have on classroom performance? A recent study, which was featured on NPR's Morning Edition, attempted to answer that question. (NPR) We read the major academic journals and case studies so you don’t have to. Sign up for The Research Is In, and we’ll send you the key takeaways once a month. With recent cheating scandals at prestigious schools -- including Harvard and the New York City prep school Stuyvesant -- the question remains: Why are smart students cheating? Author Robert Kolker looks at the psychology and various factors that can contribute to cheating -- including high-stakes testing and culture shifts caused by the Web. (New York Magazine) The ""glacial pace of change in education"" is astounding, author Madeline Levine says in an interview with MindShift. Levine notes education is resisting change, and she highlights five specific areas that would benefit from needed improvement.

Not only is Wikipedia a great tool for teachers, Obar writes, but he notes it's also an excellent aid for research. (ReadWriteWeb) Do a teacher's expectations influence student performance? NPR tried to answer that question, looking at a couple of studies. The first, which was conducted in 1964, tricked teachers into thinking some students were more likely to succeed. In turn, those students improved more than others. But why? The research found that students expected to succeed were treated differently, often in minute ways. Another more recent study also looked at how those expectations can change and suggested seven ways teachers can adjust classroom expectations. (NPR) Although several recent surveys show education in the U.S. lagging behind other developed countries, author Gregory Ferenstein makes the case for why that's never mattered.

She'll enter middle school next fall after having a great elementary school experience. She's in public schools in Virginia, and they've done a fabulous job integrating our tough standards, and managing our painfully intense testing and accountability, all the while keeping a positive focus on the child. Like every educator parent, there were times when I cringed a little about what was going on in class, or what wasn't going on.

The tool can also function as a text compactor that analyzes readings and creates more concise and condensed versions. Furthermore, the AI will generate differentiated rubrics for an assignment so that each heuristic emphasizes customized expectations and levels of challenge. Using ChatGPT, teachers can streamline communication with parents, colleagues, and administrators via AI-composed welcome-to-class letters, newsletter copy, volunteer and donation requests, supply lists, grant and field trip proposals, assembly programs, and permission sheets.

The chatbot’s prose represents another shortcoming. Without clear directions from the user, it comes off as canned, like it was written by an algorithm, when a prerequisite for uplifting, informing, and empowering students and school stakeholders is correspondence that sounds like you, not Wikipedia.

304,Education,The Overlooked Qualities That Signal Future Success—and How to Nurture Them,https://www.edutopia.org/article/the-overlooked-skills-that-signal-future-success-and-how-to-nurture-them,"https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Adam-3-final-small.jpg?resize=220,150.92000000000002&quality=85","February 23, 2024",Bestselling author and psychologist Adam Grant on rethinking grade point averages and how we misjudge what drives potential.,"A massive upset took place at the 1991 National Junior High Chess Championships. Dalton, a ritzy private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, was defeated by the Raging Rooks, a scrappy team from Harlem. “Unlike their adversaries,” writes Adam Grant, the Raging Rooks “didn’t have a decade of training or years of competition under their belts. Some of them had only learned the game in sixth grade.” How did they exceed expectations? The Raging Rooks won against the defending champions because they had a coach who was skilled at spotting “potential where others had missed it,” Grant says, and who knew how to identify and nurture powerful character traits in his students.   In his latest book, Hidden Potential: The Science of Achieving Greater Things, Grant takes on the enduring myth that “greatness is mostly born—not made.” Leaning on cutting-edge social science and economic research, as well as case studies of artists, athletes, and public figures, he argues that there are millions of overlooked students—much like the Raging Rooks—and for the most part, we’re going about the business of motivating them to reach their potential all wrong. Debunking the narrative that early academic prowess is the sole predictor of future success, Grant points instead to important intangible qualities that are vital for future career success—dispositions like discipline and determination and being proactive and prosocial. Developing these skills, he says, can’t happen in a vacuum. “You need the opportunity and motivation to nurture them.” Schools, for example, should be infusing play into the school day, challenging students to push through academic struggle and discomfort, and rethinking grading practices so they highlight not just performance but growth over time.  Grant, a Wharton professor of psychology and noted New York Times opinion columnist, is the author of influential bestsellers such as Think Again, Originals, and Option B, which he coauthored with Sheryl Sandberg. His books have sold millions of copies and have been translated into 35 languages, and his popular TED Talks have been viewed more than 30 million times.  Sign up for our newest newsletter, The Wired Classroom, and get time-saving tech tips from educators just like you. In our discussion, Grant identified some of the constraints and misconceptions that prevent schools from implementing the best evidence-based practices and suggested steps that educators can take to cultivate kids’ potential in significant ways.  ANDREW BORYGA: Why do you think we’re missing so many kids with potential?  ADAM GRANT: Teachers are crunched for time and have a tremendous amount of pressure on them. They have tests and many other core responsibilities to fulfill.  Tapping into hidden potential requires getting to know students beyond the classroom, and teachers rarely have the time, space, and freedom to do that. In a landmark study, Benjamin Bloom looked at world-class artists, scientists, athletes, and musicians and found that in many cases, their early teachers and coaches didn’t see their potential. That’s because, in part, they only get a sliver of access to somebody’s capacity. If you only have a kid in one art class, for example, you don’t know that they have a real flair for sculpting.  Another issue is that we tend to misjudge what drives potential. We tend to think, almost entirely, about natural talent. We think the kids who stand out from the start are the ones who will reach the greatest heights. But motivation is a bigger factor in growth than raw ability. Unfortunately, the tools teachers have at their disposal assess talent and ability better than they assess motivation or some of the other character skills I write about in the book.  BORYGA: Certain “character skills,” according to research by Raj Chetty and colleagues that you examine in the book, are more important to future success than early math or reading skills. What are some of those intangible skills, and why are they so valuable?  GRANT: In the data, there are character skills that are as much as 2.4 times more accurate than math and reading standardized test scores at predicting adult income. These skills include being disciplined and determined and being focused and able to persist in the face of obstacles. Another important skill is being proactive about seeking out new knowledge as opposed to just reacting to what’s presented.  One of the most underappreciated character skills is being prosocial—forging strong relationships with peers and trying to help your peers learn. A lot of people think a good way to learn something is to seek out someone who is more knowledgeable than you and soak up all of their expertise. That’s not a bad strategy. But research makes the case that you’ll tap into deeper learning if you find someone who knows less than you and teach them what you’ve already learned. Teachers inherently recognize the best way to learn something is to teach it because you understand it better once you’ve explained it. One way to build a character skill like being prosocial is to implement a jigsaw classroom, where you give students a common problem to solve or a project to do and make them each responsible for mastering a segment of the material and teaching it to the rest of the group.  If you teach kids to be interested in sharing what they’ve learned and create a classroom environment dedicated to every student enriching the knowledge of others, that’s just as good for the students doing the teaching as it is for the students doing the learning. BORYGA: A lot of educators, understandably, want to avoid putting kids in uncomfortable situations. Why is it so important to “embrace, seek, and amplify discomfort” for learners, as you say? GRANT: Lots of teachers have been taught that kids have different learning styles—that some are more visual, others are more verbal, others are more auditory. The idea is to replace one-size-fits-all education with something that’s tailored to each student’s style. The problem is we have decades of evidence which shows that while students may have a way that they like to learn, that style doesn’t predict how well they actually learn.  When something feels uncomfortable for a kid, teachers should recognize that the feeling of struggle is usually a sign students are in a position to grow. We should be challenging kids to stretch beyond their strengths and learn in ways that make them uncomfortable. Not only will that propel student growth, it will teach them not to take discomfort as a signal that they’re not naturally good at something.  BORYGA: Speaking of discomfort, civil dialogue and debate are clearly in decline. What role does disagreement play in the learning process, and why is it important for students to engage in civil debate over important issues and concepts? GRANT: Most of us fall victim to what psychologists call the bias blind spot, which is to believe that other people are biased but that you’re objective. It’s the mother of all biases. Because if you don’t even recognize that you have biases, you can’t anticipate and correct them.  But other people can see your blind spots, and when you debate them, they can challenge you to sharpen your reasoning. Debate also fuels creativity. You don’t learn by affirming your beliefs. You learn by evolving your beliefs, and that happens when you confront people who believe different things.  Unfortunately, we’re living in a world where a lot of students are argument illiterate. A big part of education is learning to reason through ideas that are not intuitive to you. If classrooms are only designed for people to build on each other’s ideas and work toward a consensus, students don’t learn the skills of questioning their assumptions or rethinking their opinions.  BORYGA: How can teachers apply some of these insights in the classroom?  GRANT: Research shows that highly creative kids are less likely to be the teacher’s pet in school because they’re poking holes in the teacher’s lesson plan, and they’re arguing with the point teachers are trying to get across. They can be a little bit disruptive and difficult. But what they’re also doing is thinking independently. That defines their creative capacity and also builds their creative muscles.  Often, however, teachers won’t entertain these disagreements in front of the class. I think we should model this in front of the class and make it clear: We don’t agree, but we can still respect and learn from each other’s point of view. What you’re doing there is instead of teaching students what to think, you’re demonstrating how to think and how to disagree. That sets them up to start thinking for themselves. And that means they are more likely to have original ideas moving forward.  BORYGA: You write that perfectionism often stops students from making the progress they have the potential to make. What’s harmful about perfectionism, and what can teachers do about it?  GRANT: Perfectionism wreaks havoc on kids. Perfectionists do get better grades in school, but they don’t do better at work. And that’s in part because perfectionists are at risk of losing the forest in the trees. They focus on small details they can get right and often miss out on the big picture.  In school you can figure out what’s going to be on the test and master all the material. But in the real world, not only do you not know what’s on the test, there isn’t even a test. Perfectionists struggle in that situation. They tend to focus on the things they know they can ace, and that means they end up with a really narrow comfort zone. They’re not trying new things, and they’re constantly beating themselves up for tiny mistakes.  I think the lesson teachers need to instill in students is that you shouldn’t shame your past self, you should try to educate your future self. The value of your mistake is that you’re going to learn how to avoid that mistake and others like it in the future. And that’s a skill. It’s a character skill. It’s one we need to develop early and reinforce often.  BORYGA: Our audience of teachers are always interested in grading practices. You write that traditional grading methods often judge students based on past performance rather than tracking improvements over time. How can schools do a better job of measuring progress?  GRANT: I think the idea of a grade point trajectory, as opposed to a grade point average, is really powerful.  If you look at high school and how performance is a predictor of college success, freshman grades are almost irrelevant. Sophomore grades are a little bit predictive, and junior and senior year grades are much more consequential. But for the most part, we just use the average of all four years and collapse across that.  A student who has a B-plus average, consistently, year over year, is scored the same as one who started out getting B-minuses and ended up with As. But that second student has shown tremendous growth and demonstrates an ability to recover from early failure or struggle. And over time, those are the students we want to invest in because we can see their hidden potential in that trajectory.  We can grade students relative to their starting performance as opposed to just assessing where they land. This would help students, teachers, and parents get a map of what a kid’s progress looks like over time. This could also be a helpful antidote to the tendency to compare yourself to other people. We want students comparing themselves to their past selves more often and to their peers less often. This interview has been edited for brevity, clarity, and flow."," “Unlike their adversaries,” writes Adam Grant, the Raging Rooks “didn’t have a decade of training or years of competition under their belts. The Raging Rooks won against the defending champions because they had a coach who was skilled at spotting “potential where others had missed it,” Grant says, and who knew how to identify and nurture powerful character traits in his students."

Our teachers were in the same position several weeks ago that U.S. teachers are in now—we were expecting to teach in classrooms in Beijing. Now we’re teaching virtual classes remotely from our homes in China and countries around the world. We had about half a week to prepare for online school, including setting up a digital platform that none of us had ever used before. For the first few weeks, we needed to be very flexible and patient. Everything we would have done in person took longer virtually as we learned to navigate online learning. But we’ve worked out many kinks and are now engaging our students in high-quality learning experiences online. Since our students have stopped physically attending school, their Chinese classes happen in real time following the regular schedule, using a Chinese app. Our international team teaches using Moodle, an open-source learning platform that has the ability to do live video conferencing with digital whiteboards and break-out rooms. We also use it to give students feedback, do partner and group work, and publish class materials—things that can be done through Google Classroom as well. Here is some of what we’ve learned so far about teaching students who must stay home. Start by continuing to use lessons that are clear and simple, and don’t introduce new programs for teachers and students to learn if you can help it. Our international teachers are on four continents across eight time zones, so most of our classes are asynchronous, meaning our teachers post assignments and recorded lessons and students complete work at different times. Teachers respond using a rubric, comments, and sometimes recorded video or audio feedback through our online learning platform. Most of our teachers have at least three live classes each week in addition to the asynchronous classes. This helps build community in the class, engages students, and makes the learning more interactive. Some teachers have found it more effective to teach live classes daily. It’s easy for students to spend a lot of time in front of screens for their online school. As much as possible, we’re assigning students tasks that get them up and moving and away from their devices. We’ve also been working out ways to have students continue to create art without screens. Videos: A first-grade class recently had a homework assignment where students needed to describe a pet. One boy’s mother video recorded him while he used descriptive language to introduce the audience to his two cats. Students can also write and perform plays, or create and cook recipes and conduct interviews, and submit these assignments through video. Workbooks and drawing: Many of our classes at school intentionally used workbooks and paper-based tasks instead of laptops to reduce students’ screen time. We’re continuing this by having students complete some assignments on paper, taking a picture of their completed work, and uploading the photo to submit the task. Similarly, our art classes are continuing to have students work on drawing, and they are taking pictures of their work to submit it to their teacher and share with the class. Subscribe to the Edutopia Weekly newsletter—full of innovative teaching and learning strategies that will work with your students. Get articles recommended for you. In addition to asynchronous and live classes, our teachers all have daily three-hour office hour shifts. They log into Moodle for the duration and are visible as “online” for any student visiting the page. This enables students to contact a teacher for help as they’re doing their schoolwork, and it helps our teachers maintain regular schedules. This resource is comforting to both students and parents as a way to maintain instant communication with the school and teachers in real time. It’s also a way for everyone to feel a little less isolated. Office hours are not for tech support. Early on, we clearly communicated to families how to reach our IT support staff for technical help. We remind families and students regularly—at first we did this daily—who to go to for what types of support. We also have our teachers’ office hours schedules and IT contact information clearly posted on our online learning site. Tech support is vital to your remote learning being successful. Decide as soon as possible who will be responsible for what types of IT support, and how they will be reachable by students, families, and staff. Make sure all of your stakeholders know how to reach out for support. Give teachers, students, and families video and written instructions on how to use your platform so they can answer some of their own questions before reaching out for help. Many students don’t have laptops at home, but in the U.S., most families have access to at least one smartphone that has internet. Fortunately, Google for Education and other online learning platforms typically have good user experiences for smartphones and tablets, in addition to computers. Between having to find childcare and supervise squirmy young learners, remote learning can be a very stressful experience for parents. Proactively and regularly communicate with them in mediums and languages that you know they’ll actively check and understand. Give them clear directions and resources. Solicit, listen to, and act on their feedback. And, as you would with regular school, make sure to reach out to parents with news of great work their children did. Specific work-related praise goes a long way to strengthening relationships with both families and students. At school, our team has weekly professional development sessions. We’ve continued this using our online platform every week with consistent start and end times. Agendas are developed with our instructional leadership team and distributed to teachers in advance. We split our time between continuing to work on our year-long focus of developing our unit plans, modeling how to use our online platform, and answering questions teachers have in real time. In addition to professional development and regular communication, we teachers are working on maintaining our sense of community. We celebrate birthdays and share photos and videos of where we are in the world. There’s even talk of doing virtual yoga classes together. When building digital lessons, it’s helpful to reduce the number of external links on your online learning platform. For example, if you want students to read an article, it’s safer to upload a PDF, rather than a link to an external site that may or may not work. This helps ensure that students are always able to access their digital learning resources. Collaborating: All of our planning materials are shared on Microsoft OneDrive. Like Google Drive, this platform lets us share documents among staff and send students links to documents and folders. Video: We download YouTube and other videos locally to our computer using the free app 4K Video Downloader, and then upload them to OneDrive (you can do this with Google Drive as well). Make sure to download captions. Readings: When assigning students articles from sites like Newsela and CommonLit, we download the articles onto our computer as a PDF and then upload them to OneDrive. This allows us to label files by reading level and have all the resources for a lesson in the same place. Videoconferencing: Moodle has its own video conferencing platform, but Zoom is a very convenient way to have live classes with students—and it is now free for schools. The platform also lets you share your desktop, which is helpful for PowerPoint presentations, reviewing student work with a class, and modeling how to do online research."," Since February 17, I’ve been teaching 11th-grade humanities writing to students who are self-quarantined in China.

Christakis says that we’ve reached a perilous moment for very young kids: Increasingly we treat them as commodities and find ourselves “in danger of losing the child in childhood.” Instead of imposing adult expectations, she argues, parents and teachers should try to “take their blinders off” and see the world through the eyes of young children—a change in perspective that might allow us to better understand and cultivate their unique abilities. I recently had the opportunity to ask her about our evolving cultural values around childhood, what good early educational environments look like, and how we can resist the tendency to “adultify” young children. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Your book on early childhood education is called The Importance of Being Little. Why is “being little” so important? What do you want parents, educators, and policy makers to know about this developmental stage? Traveling around the country, teaching and talking with parents and educators from a variety of backgrounds and environments, has persuaded me that we’re in danger of losing the child in childhood. The notion that there is something of value in being a little kid—with little kid desires and, above all, needs—seems to have fallen out of favor. We talk about young children, increasingly, as commodities to “invest” in for future payoffs. Parents express enormous anxiety about their children’s futures, and seem to be curating their children’s life experiences in a way that would look quite unnatural and even rather joyless to previous generations. There’s a weird paradox that early childhood is both safe and stressful. On the one hand, for most children, especially in the industrialized world, the early years are safer than they’ve ever been in human history. Children have fewer fatal accidents and debilitating diseases. We don’t send children down coal mines to work. Of course there is poverty, stress, and trauma—and some of these problems affect very large numbers of children—but in general terms, many of the big ‘killers’ of childhood have been vanquished. On the other hand, 21st-century American society poses many challenges for young children too. Technology is not always a friend to the young, and there are new and troubling stresses. We have an actual epidemic of preschool expulsions, for example (which disproportionately affect children of color and boys), and increasing numbers of kids with mental health and behavioral challenges. “Being little” is of critical importance because we see the signature of early childhood experience literally in people’s bodies: their life expectancies are longer and their social-emotional capabilities are more robust when they have a chance to learn through play and through deep relationships, and when their developing brains are given the chance to grow in a nurturing, language-rich, and relatively unhurried environment. It’s clearer than ever before that young children are not simply mini-adults. Get our new newsletter, The Research Is In—a monthly roundup of the most impactful education research, translated into actionable classroom strategies. Right, and you use the term “adultification” in your writing. How do you define adultification, and what does it reveal about how we think about childhood? Adultification is the failure to see the world from a child’s perspective. I sometimes ask teachers to get down on the floor of their classroom and just look around from the height of a 4-year-old, or try to put on a snowsuit with the motor abilities of a young child. It’s eye-opening to reflect on the many ways that adults inflict adult pacing, adult expectations, and adult schedules on young kids. And for what reason? Young children sleep less and have far more transitions in their days than in previous generations—and I think most educators and parents would agree that their developing brains aren’t really designed to cope with adult schedules and pacing. We all basically know this is a problem, but it’s hard to break the cycle. We need to step back and see the world from a child’s point of view. We see their development through an adult’s eyes, imagining that we couldn’t possibly learn anything from an hour digging in a container of mud, so it must be time to whip out the math worksheet! It boggles the mind how little outdoor time and gross motor play many young children have in their days. Some of this adultification comes from an inattention to what makes little kids tick and a profound lack of faith in what young children are capable of. What does high-quality early education look like? If you walked into a preschool that uses best practices, what would you see and hear? Quality education is about relationships. Caring teachers who understand child development and who know and are attuned to the children in their care are far more important than many of the measures of quality we use today, such as class size, physical environments, or a specific curriculum. Rich, open-ended conversation is critical, and children need time in the day to experience warm, empathic oral language—to converse with each other playfully, to tell a rambling story to an adult, to listen to high-quality literature and ask meaningful questions. The research shows that quality caregivers know both the broad parameters of child development (“This is what a 3-year-old looks like”) and know their children as individuals (“This is what this child is like”). But it’s crucial to keep in mind that intentional, attuned teaching is the opposite of a free-for-all where children are running the show. Quality preschool teachers are intentional about everything they do: the classroom routines, the physical environment, the schedule, the types of materials they make available for children to explore and manipulate. These teachers do an extraordinary amount of observation and reflection—and it’s really almost impossible to do that in a vacuum: the best preschools have collegial, inquiry-based cultures so that they can continually experiment with and modify their learning environments to take advantage of children’s natural curiosity. This is especially true for the many young children who have backgrounds of trauma and adverse childhood experiences. If a child walks in the door not having had anything to eat the night before—or maybe they are processing something positive, like welcoming a new sibling or a grandparent—the high-quality preschool classroom will have a mechanism to respond to those experiences and to channel them into cognitive and social-emotional growth. Educators in these environments take as a starting point that children are fully capable of learning, and they refuse to let school or state mandates dictate how children learn. You write a lot about the importance of play. How do you define play, and why is it so crucial? Play is the defining feature of mammalian development: the impulse is hardwired into us and can’t be suppressed. However, it’s crucial that we recognize that while the play impulse is one thing, the play know-how—the nuts and bolts of playing—is not always so natural, and requires careful cultivation. We’re seeing more dysfunctional play in modern industrialized societies. Children don’t play as much in mixed-age groups, where younger kids can learn from older ones, and the older children in turn have to learn to be gentle and fair with their littlest players. Children have less free time to mess around and make their own rules. They need the time and space to learn how to play effectively, and they require a culture that values play. Increasingly, we don’t seem to have that kind of early childhood culture. So if you suddenly tell a child to “go make a fort out of a cardboard box” when they haven’t had a steady diet of free, unstructured time and access to open-ended materials, well, you will see a cranky and possibly incredulous child. You’ve said, “The authentic early childhood curriculum isn’t necessarily contained in the word we reflexively call ‘preschool.’ It doesn’t need to be in a school at all.” Would you explain what you mean by that? Anyone who has seen the wonder on a child’s face when they see a butterfly landing on a flower understands that learning goes far beyond a classroom. The good news is that children are wired with the capacity for learning in almost any setting. With the loving support of responsive adults, they can learn without the bells and whistles of what we call preschool. So much learning comes about naturally from what scientists call the serve-and-return style of communication between an adult and young child, which others have referred to as a conversational “duet.” There’s a lot of evidence that we can close some of the gaps between lower-income children’s academic trajectories and those of higher-income families by coaching parents and educators to use this approach in their everyday interactions with children. I often coach teachers to ask open-ended questions such as “Tell me about your drawing,” rather than “checking” questions like “What color is the apple?” or “What are you drawing?” The open-ended response really opens up a huge space for spontaneous and deep learning."," Christakis says that we’ve reached a perilous moment for very young kids: Increasingly we treat them as commodities and find ourselves “in danger of losing the child in childhood.” Instead of imposing adult expectations, she argues, parents and teachers should try to “take their blinders off” and see the world through the eyes of young children—a change in perspective that might allow us to better understand and cultivate their unique abilities.

For many educators, technology has driven it toward extinction—and it’s time to get serious about reclaiming it.","Technology is compromising the health and well-being of teachers, blurring the already-indistinct boundaries between work and home and leading to an unsustainable “always on” mentality, researchers assert in a new study. It’s not an entirely new problem. For decades, educators have labored under the twin pressures of expanding responsibilities at work and increasing domestic demands. As dual-income families became the norm, larger class sizes, more paperwork, and a gradual shift in caretaking duties toward school systems have strained the capacity of educators, encroaching on personal time traditionally set aside for family and friends. Well before the pandemic, stress topped the list of reasons teachers quit, according to a RAND study, which identified long hours and the burden of taking on second jobs to supplement income as primary factors in early retirement.  Get a first look at our new newsletter—a monthly roundup of education research curated by our editors, and presented in a way that’s clear, concise, and practical. Technology is rapidly pushing things toward a breaking point. The proliferation of computers, and especially cell phones, is putting the last vestiges of personal space at risk, compelling teachers to spend more time outside of school hours planning tech-enriched lessons while responding to nighttime emails and text messages. This pattern of incursion—researchers call it “techno-invasion” or “pervasive connectivity”—can make them feel as though they’re on call at all hours of the day and even late into the night, explains Caroline Murphy, a researcher at the Kemmy Business School at the University of Limerick, in the current study.  For teachers, there are few places to turn to for respite. While the public sector has typically traded lower wages for better work-life balance, the commodification of teaching—driven by a greater focus on test scores and evaluating teacher performance—has led to what some experts call the “marketization of education.” Increasingly, the profession looks like the private sector, “in particular in relation to demands around working time, and the development of an ‘always on’ culture,” Murphy points out. In what amounts to a broken promise, the expectations keep growing, but the pay hasn’t kept pace.  Without new policies defending teachers’ fundamental right to disconnect—to reclaim time with their families and friends, and to relax and restore themselves—the outcomes are all too predictable. Rising job dissatisfaction and deteriorating mental and physical health are real risks, according to the research. The issue is serious and growing, and it demands immediate attention. Online communications have led to a pervasive “encroachment of work on individuals’ time off through ubiquitous connectivity,” says Murphy. The mere expectation that an email or text may arrive from a principal or student, and demand a response, is an intrusion into a teacher’s personal space. Theoretical emails eventually become real ones. The average teacher receives up to 100 emails each day, a staggering amount that can feel insurmountable—and the pressure to reply quickly can feel irresistible. In a 2019 study, employees reported that they started responding to emails 6 seconds after receiving them. Meanwhile, in a 2015 study, researchers observed that employees experienced “significantly lower daily stress” when limiting the frequency of checking email to three times a day, compared with those who had no restrictions.  There’s also a significant cognitive tax to checking emails and other notifications, like texts or reminders: According to a 2017 study, the barrage of pings and warnings emanating from our phones are almost impossible to ignore, even when the phone is off and turned upside down on the table. “The mere presence of one’s own smartphone may occupy limited-capacity cognitive resources,” the researchers conclude, “thereby leaving fewer resources available for other tasks and undercutting cognitive performance.” Shutting the cell phone off and abandoning it in another room was the only way to restore sanity.  The deluge of new technologies unsupported by adequate training—from learning management systems to new apps, videoconferencing software, and multimedia lesson-planning—is undermining competence and professionalism, Murphy argues. “I have NEVER been this exhausted,” exclaimed Sarah Gross, a veteran high school English teacher who did hybrid teaching last fall, according to the New York Times. “This is not sustainable.” Gross isn’t alone: In 2021, researchers analyzed over a decade’s worth of studies and found that teachers were being pushed to adopt technology in their classrooms without the “technical resources and equipment necessary for its correct didactic use,” a particularly insidious problem that culminated in “conflicts between teachers, as well as in their relationships with colleagues or with other people involved in the environment, eventually producing, in the worst case, damaged personal and interpersonal relationships that affect their health.” In a study published earlier this year, researchers found that nearly half of the teachers surveyed spent 20 or more hours per week creating new lessons, adapting materials to online classrooms, and troubleshooting tech issues. Notably, this pattern is expected to continue past the pandemic as schools commit to deeper integration of technology and even offer some form of remote instruction permanently. This new source of anxiety is not only linked to decreased job satisfaction, motivation, and competency but is also a health and safety concern, “causing physical ailments such as headaches, sleep issues, muscle cramps, back aches and high blood pressure,” according to Murphy.  It’s not technology itself that’s the problem—it’s that technology erodes the boundaries that have historically constrained altruistic teachers. “We may feel that if we don’t get a task done, our students will suffer or programs will fail,” explains John McCarthy, a former teacher and current consultant. “However, if we become mentally exhausted, overtired, or drained of energy, we risk a complete shutdown mentally or physically—and at that point, no tasks will get done.” According to a 2015 survey, 78 percent of teachers feel physically and emotionally exhausted at the end of the day, and while technology isn’t the sole source of stress, it is “one of the most significant contributing factors to increasing stress levels,” Murphy points out, adding that educators routinely report that “invasion of privacy” is a “significant source of work exhaustion.” That’s not to say that Ludditical solutions like banning technology should be pursued; technology creates enormous efficiencies and is here to stay, but it must be carefully managed. Murphy asserts that we need to establish and adopt policy that “supports the healthy adoption of technology outside of school hours by both teachers and students.” While the United States is lagging behind other countries, “right to disconnect” legislation has been proposed in New York to protect workers from being penalized if they choose not to respond to emails after work hours. Meanwhile, major companies have begun to acknowledge the problem. Volkswagen banned internal emails from being sent or received through its servers during off-work hours in 2012, following “complaints that staff’s work and home lives were becoming blurred.” And in 2016, France adopted new labor laws giving employees the right “to not have to take calls or read emails related to work during their time off.” The law’s stated goal is to “ensure that the employees’ non-work hours, vacation time, and personal and family life be respected.” So what should be under consideration for schools?"," Technology is compromising the health and well-being of teachers, blurring the already-indistinct boundaries between work and home and leading to an unsustainable “always on” mentality, researchers assert in a new study.

308,Education,"Schools Are Opening Worldwide, Providing a Model for the U.S.",https://www.edutopia.org/article/schools-are-opening-worldwide-providing-model-us,"https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Getty-1211656925.jpg?resize=220,150.92000000000002&quality=85","May 8, 2020",Children are returning to school in countries that are weeks—or months—ahead of the U.S. in battling Covid-19. Here’s how it’s happening.,"Yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report setting out guidelines for opening child-care programs, day camps, and K-12 schools—or the report leaked, depending on who you read. 

The guidelines break school reopening into three phases—each with incrementally more relaxed rules, if infection rates are sufficiently low—but the big picture provides some good news: the recommendations reveal a path forward for schools to reopen, albeit with restrictions. 

High-touch surfaces, toys, drinking fountains, and school buses should be cleaned frequently, the CDC says; playgrounds and cafeterias should be closed or used in staggered shifts; field trips should be canceled; health screenings and body temperature checks for adults and students upon arrival should be considered; cloth masks should be mandatory for staff; and good air circulation throughout the school should be a priority. If someone in the building is later confirmed to be sick with Covid-19, the CDC writes, you might consider closing the school for one or two days to allow for cleaning. Already a few U.S. states with low case and fatality rates—Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming—have quietly announced reopening dates for some schools or school populations this year (students with IEPs, for example), though final decisions in Montana, for example, are left up to the local districts. Most of the country’s K-12 schools will remain closed until at least the fall. In parts of Western Europe and Asia, though, where Covid-19 touched down weeks, and in some cases months, earlier than in the U.S., the threat from the virus has gradually diminished—and schools have reopened to welcome students and teachers into classrooms. Reports from major news publications indicate that even with the strict new rules, children and teachers are generally happy to be back, but the reopenings have not been without controversy: In Denmark, some parents have protested, reported Patrick Kinsgley for The New York Times, and in Tel Aviv some teachers have pushed back over health and safety concerns, wrote Steve Hendrix in The Washington Post. A recent article by Business Insider’s Emily Cavanagh peeked inside the equivalent of K-12 schools operating around the world, from Taiwan to Denmark, China, Norway, and Israel, and looked at the common safety precautions in place. We also looked at recent coverage from The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, CNN, NBC, and The New York Times to get a better picture of the state of schools internationally. We’ve been hearing about staggered start times, or alternate day attendance, ever since California Gov. Gavin Newsom broached the topic in mid-April, as reported in the Los Angeles Times.

In Israel, as some schools began to open as the country’s infection rate declined, staggering arrival times has reduced the crowding that often occurs as buildings open, The Washington Post’s Hendrix reported. Other schools are increasing the number of school entry points to cut down on congestion. 

Meanwhile, in Denmark, where many schools have been open since mid-April—it was “the first country in the Western world to reopen its elementary schools since the start of the coronavirus pandemic,” according to The New York Times’s Kingsley—there’s another big change: Parents aren’t allowed in the building. Teachers, students, and parents are subject to temperature scans at the door—and in some countries, several times throughout the day—often from temperature guns that measure heat coming off the body, though there are concerns about the reliability of these devices outside carefully controlled health-care settings. The CDC guidelines recommend that schools develop protocols for isolating and transporting potentially sick adults or students: Schools should “identify an area to separate anyone who exhibits Covid-like symptoms” and set up “procedures for safely transporting anyone sick home or to a health-care facility.” In Shanghai, special isolation rooms have been set aside to separate people suspected of having the virus from everyone else, according to Business Insider’s Cavanagh. Protecting the vulnerable is crucial. In Israel, teachers and other school staff over the age of 65, and anyone with underlying health concerns, are encouraged to stay home, The Washington Post’s Hendrix reported. The CDC mirrors this guidance: “Protect and support staff and students who are at higher risk for severe illness, such as providing options for telework and virtual learning.” Social distancing throughout school is being enforced: In Denmark, Israel, and Norway, desks “are spaced six feet apart, which is the official recommendation for effective social distancing,” noted Cavanagh. Playgrounds, gym classes, school libraries, and even teachers’ lounges are closed in some countries.

Communal lunches are barred, in most cases, which is consistent with CDC guidelines: “If a cafeteria or group dining room is typically used, serve meals in classrooms instead. Serve individually plated meals.” In some schools, students are assigned seats in the cafeteria, which are arranged three feet apart. Buffet-style grazing is out; food is often plated and served individually, to reduce the obvious channels of transmission.

Small groups of students are often kept together for the whole day—social mixing is discouraged—and are sequestered in a single classroom to avoid congregating in hallways. In Denmark, many classes are conducted outdoors or in outdoor tents, where social distancing measures are easier to accommodate, according to CNN, NBC, and others. Many, though not all, schools require masks for adults and students, and hand washing and sanitizing are frequent. “In Denmark, schools have installed handwashing stations outside of the buildings and students have to wash their hands at least once an hour,” Cavanagh writes, while in Norway classrooms, toys, and frequently touched surfaces are now sanitized twice daily. In another safety measure, notes Kingsley about Danish schools: “Tea ladies have the new task of touring the school with disinfectant, cleaning each door handle at least twice during school hours.”

With a pandemic disrupting life across the entire globe, teachers scrambled to transform their physical classrooms into virtual—or even hybrid—ones, and researchers slowly began to collect insights into what works, and what doesn’t, in online learning environments around the world. Meanwhile, neuroscientists made a convincing case for keeping handwriting in schools, and after the closure of several coal-fired power plants in Chicago, researchers reported a drop in pediatric emergency room visits and fewer absences in schools, reminding us that questions of educational equity do not begin and end at the schoolhouse door. When students are learning a new language, ask them to act out vocabulary words. It’s fun to unleash a child’s inner thespian, of course, but a 2020 study concluded that it also nearly doubles their ability to remember the words months later. Researchers asked 8-year-old students to listen to words in another language and then use their hands and bodies to mimic the words—spreading their arms and pretending to fly, for example, when learning the German word flugzeug, which means “airplane.” After two months, these young actors were a remarkable 73 percent more likely to remember the new words than students who had listened without accompanying gestures. Researchers discovered similar, if slightly less dramatic, results when students looked at pictures while listening to the corresponding vocabulary.  It’s a simple reminder that if you want students to remember something, encourage them to learn it in a variety of ways—by drawing it, acting it out, or pairing it with relevant images, for example.

In 2012, brain scans of preliterate children revealed crucial reading circuitry flickering to life when kids hand-printed letters and then tried to read them. The effect largely disappeared when the letters were typed or traced. More recently, in 2020, a team of researchers studied older children—seventh graders—while they handwrote, drew, and typed words, and concluded that handwriting and drawing produced telltale neural tracings indicative of deeper learning. “Whenever self-generated movements are included as a learning strategy, more of the brain gets stimulated,” the researchers explain, before echoing the 2012 study: “It also appears that the movements related to keyboard typing do not activate these networks the same way that drawing and handwriting do.” It would be a mistake to replace typing with handwriting, though. All kids need to develop digital skills, and there’s evidence that technology helps children with dyslexia to overcome obstacles like note taking or illegible handwriting, ultimately freeing them to “use their time for all the things in which they are gifted,” says the Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity. A 2020 study found that ACT test scores, which are often a key factor in college admissions, showed a weak—or even negative—relationship when it came to predicting how successful students would be in college. “There is little evidence that students will have more college success if they work to improve their ACT score,” the researchers explain, and students with very high ACT scores—but indifferent high school grades—often flamed out in college, overmatched by the rigors of a university’s academic schedule. Just last year, the SAT—cousin to the ACT—had a similarly dubious public showing. In a major 2019 study of nearly 50,000 students led by researcher Brian Galla, and including Angela Duckworth, researchers found that high school grades were stronger predictors of four-year-college graduation than SAT scores. The reason? Four-year high school grades, the researchers asserted, are a better indicator of crucial skills like perseverance, time management, and the ability to avoid distractions. It’s most likely those skills, in the end, that keep kids in college. A simple step might help undercut the pernicious effect of grading bias, a new study found: Articulate your standards clearly before you begin grading, and refer to the standards regularly during the assessment process. In 2020, more than 1,500 teachers were recruited and asked to grade a writing sample from a fictional second-grade student. All of the sample stories were identical—but in one set, the student mentions a family member named Dashawn, while the other set references a sibling named Connor. Teachers were 13 percent more likely to give the Connor papers a passing grade, revealing the invisible advantages that many students unknowingly benefit from. When grading criteria are vague, implicit stereotypes can insidiously “fill in the blanks,” explains the study’s author. But when teachers have an explicit set of criteria to evaluate the writing—asking whether the student “provides a well-elaborated recount of an event,” for example—the difference in grades is nearly eliminated. When three coal-fired plants closed in the Chicago area, student absences in nearby schools dropped by 7 percent, a change largely driven by fewer emergency room visits for asthma-related problems. The stunning finding, published in a 2020 study from Duke and Penn State, underscores the role that often-overlooked environmental factors—like air quality, neighborhood crime, and noise pollution—have in keeping our children healthy and ready to learn. At scale, the opportunity cost is staggering: About 2.3 million children in the United States still attend a public elementary or middle school located within 10 kilometers of a coal-fired plant. The study builds on a growing body of research that reminds us that questions of educational equity do not begin and end at the schoolhouse door. What we call an achievement gap is often an equity gap, one that “takes root in the earliest years of children’s lives,” according to a 2017 study. We won’t have equal opportunity in our schools, the researchers admonish, until we are diligent about confronting inequality in our cities, our neighborhoods—and ultimately our own backyards. Some of the most popular study strategies—highlighting passages, rereading notes, and underlining key sentences—are also among the least effective. A 2020 study highlighted a powerful alternative: Get students to generate questions about their learning, and gradually press them to ask more probing questions. In the study, students who studied a topic and then generated their own questions scored an average of 14 percentage points higher on a test than students who used passive strategies like studying their notes and rereading classroom material. Creating questions, the researchers found, not only encouraged students to think more deeply about the topic but also strengthened their ability to remember what they were studying. There are many engaging ways to have students create highly productive questions: When creating a test, you can ask students to submit their own questions, or you can use the Jeopardy! game as a platform for student-created questions. One of the most widely used reading programs was dealt a severe blow when a panel of reading experts concluded that it “would be unlikely to lead to literacy success for all of America’s public schoolchildren.” In the 2020 study, the experts found that the controversial program—called “Units of Study” and developed over the course of four decades by Lucy Calkins at the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project—failed to explicitly and systematically teach young readers how to decode and encode written words, and was thus “in direct opposition to an enormous body of settled research.” The study sounded the death knell for practices that de-emphasize phonics in favor of having children use multiple sources of information—like story events or illustrations—to predict the meaning of unfamiliar words, an approach often associated with “balanced literacy.” In an internal memo obtained by publisher APM, Calkins seemed to concede the point, writing that “aspects of balanced literacy need some ‘rebalancing.’” In 2020, a team at Georgia State University compiled a report on virtual learning best practices. While evidence in the field is ""sparse"" and ""inconsistent,"" the report noted that logistical issues like accessing materials—and not content-specific problems like failures of comprehension—were often among the most significant obstacles to online learning. It wasn’t that students didn’t understand photosynthesis in a virtual setting, in other words—it was that they didn’t find (or simply didn't access) the lesson on photosynthesis at all. That basic insight echoed a 2019 study that highlighted the crucial need to organize virtual classrooms even more intentionally than physical ones. Remote teachers should use a single, dedicated hub for important documents like assignments; simplify communications and reminders by using one channel like email or text; and reduce visual clutter like hard-to-read fonts and unnecessary decorations throughout their virtual spaces. Because the tools are new to everyone, regular feedback on topics like accessibility and ease of use is crucial. Teachers should post simple surveys asking questions like “Have you encountered any technical issues?” and “Can you easily locate your assignments?” to ensure that students experience a smooth-running virtual learning space. Learning how to code more closely resembles learning a language such as Chinese or Spanish than learning math, a 2020 study found—upending the conventional wisdom about what makes a good programmer. In the study, young adults with no programming experience were asked to learn Python, a popular programming language; they then took a series of tests assessing their problem-solving, math, and language skills. The researchers discovered that mathematical skill accounted for only 2 percent of a person’s ability to learn how to code, while language skills were almost nine times more predictive, accounting for 17 percent of learning ability. That’s an important insight because all too often, programming classes require that students pass advanced math courses—a hurdle that needlessly excludes students with untapped promise, the researchers claim. “Content is comprehension,” declared a 2020 Fordham Institute study, sounding a note of defiance as it staked out a position in the ongoing debate over the teaching of intrinsic reading skills versus the teaching of content knowledge. While elementary students spend an enormous amount of time working on skills like “finding the main idea” and “summarizing”—tasks born of the belief that reading is a discrete and trainable ability that transfers seamlessly across content areas—these young readers aren’t experiencing “the additional reading gains that well-intentioned educators hoped for,” the study concluded. So what works? The researchers looked at data from more than 18,000 K–5 students, focusing on the time spent in subject areas like math, social studies, and ELA, and found that “social studies is the only subject with a clear, positive, and statistically significant effect on reading improvement.” In effect, exposing kids to rich content in civics, history, and law appeared to teach reading more effectively than our current methods of teaching reading.

Perhaps defiance is no longer needed: Fordham’s conclusions are rapidly becoming conventional wisdom—and they extend beyond the limited claim of reading social studies texts. According to Natalie Wexler, the author of the well-received 2019 book The Knowledge Gap, content knowledge and reading are intertwined. “Students with more [background] knowledge have a better chance of understanding whatever text they encounter. They’re able to retrieve more information about the topic from long-term memory, leaving more space in working memory for comprehension,” she recently told Edutopia."," Researchers asked 8-year-old students to listen to words in another language and then use their hands and bodies to mimic the words—spreading their arms and pretending to fly, for example, when learning the German word flugzeug, which means “airplane.” After two months, these young actors were a remarkable 73 percent more likely to remember the new words than students who had listened without accompanying gestures. “Whenever self-generated movements are included as a learning strategy, more of the brain gets stimulated,” the researchers explain, before echoing the 2012 study: “It also appears that the movements related to keyboard typing do not activate these networks the same way that drawing and handwriting do.” It would be a mistake to replace typing with handwriting, though."

At the time, psychologists were interested in general intelligence—a person’s ability to solve problems and apply logical reasoning across a wide range of disciplines. Popularized in part by the IQ test, which was originally developed in the early 1900s to assess a child’s ability to “understand, reason, and make judgments,” the idea of general intelligence helped explain why some students seemed to excel at many subjects. Gardner found the concept too limiting. “Most lay and scholarly writings about intelligence focus on a combination of linguistic and logical intelligences. The particular intellectual strengths, I often maintain, of a law professor,” Gardner explains. Having grown up playing piano, Gardner wondered why the arts weren’t included in discussions about intelligence. As a graduate student studying psychology in the 1960s, he felt “struck by the virtual absence of any mention of the arts in the key textbooks.” That doubt planted the seed that grew into Gardner’s big insight: The prevailing idea of a single, monolithic intelligence didn’t match the world he observed. Surely Mozart’s genius was partially, but not fully, explained by an extraordinary musical intelligence. And wasn’t it the case that all people demonstrated a wide range of intellectual capabilities—from linguistic to social to logical—that were often mutually reinforcing, and that ebbed and flowed over time based on a person’s changing interests and efforts? Those hypotheses have largely been confirmed by recent studies from the fields of neuroscience. A 2015 study, for example, upends the centuries-old idea that reading occurs in distinct areas of the brain; scientists have discovered, instead, that language processing “involves all of the regions of the brain, because it involves all cognitive functioning of humans”—not just visual processing but also attention, abstract reasoning, working memory, and predicting, to name a few. And a growing body of evidence has dramatically altered our understanding of brain development, revealing that we continue to grow and change intellectually well into adulthood. But if Gardner’s objective was to broaden and democratize our conception of intelligence—an idea that resonates deeply with teachers—the pull of the old model has been hard to shake. Today, the idea of multiple intelligences is as popular as ever, but it’s starting to look suspiciously like the theory Gardner sought to displace. “It’s true that I write a lot and also that I am misunderstood a lot,” says Gardner, who originally proposed seven distinct intelligences, adding an eighth a decade later. The big mistake: In popular culture, and in our educational system, the theory of multiple intelligences has too often been conflated with learning styles, reducing Gardner’s premise of a multifaceted system back to a single “preferred intelligence”: Students are visual or auditory learners, for example, but never both. We’ve stumbled into the same old trap—we’ve simply traded one intelligence for another. “If people want to talk about ‘an impulsive style’ or ‘a visual learner,’ that’s their prerogative,” Gardner clarifies. “But they should recognize that these labels may be unhelpful, at best, and ill-conceived at worst.” It’s clear that children learn differently—teachers in Edutopia’s audience are adamant on that score—but research shows that when students process and retain information, there is no dominant biological style, and that when teachers try to match instruction to a perceived learning style, the benefits are nonexistent. Still, the idea endures. Get our new newsletter, The Research Is In—a monthly roundup of the most impactful education research, translated into actionable classroom strategies. Over 90 percent of teachers believe that students learn better when they receive information tailored to their preferred learning styles, but that’s a myth, explains Paul Howard-Jones, professor of neuroscience and education at the University of Bristol. “The brain’s interconnectivity makes such an assumption unsound, and reviews of educational literature and controlled laboratory studies fail to support this approach to teaching.” Students are also swayed by the idea. In a study published earlier this year, medical professors Polly Husmann and Valerie O’Loughlin found that many of their students “still hold to the conventional wisdom that learning styles are legitimate,” and often adapt their study strategies to match these learning styles. But after analyzing the test scores of these students, researchers found no improvement. Instead, they found that tried-and-true strategies—such as viewing microscope slides online—worked equally well for all students, whether they considered themselves linguistic or visual learners. The study highlights the value of learning through multiple modalities, which is an effective way to boost memory and understanding. A 2015 study found that students have a deeper conceptual understanding of a lesson when teachers pair lectures with diagrams. And a review spanning three decades of research found that students retain more information when textbooks contain illustrations because the images complement the text. When students use more than one medium to process a lesson, learning is more deeply encoded—and being overly reliant on a perceived dominant learning style is a recipe for learning less effectively. So what should teachers do? Gardner argues that “multiple intelligences should not, in and of itself, be an educational goal.” Instead, here are a few evidence-based dos and don’ts for applying multiple intelligences theory in your classroom. Do: Don’t:"," Popularized in part by the IQ test, which was originally developed in the early 1900s to assess a child’s ability to “understand, reason, and make judgments,” the idea of general intelligence helped explain why some students seemed to excel at many subjects.

Have you had a student who refuses to go to school? How about a student who attends but skips class? Or a student who puts their head on the table when told to work on a task during class? As adults, we may run because we think we can’t handle a situation in what’s known as avoidance, or we may hide because we don’t want to deal with a situation in what psychologists call escape. Students are no different. Avoidance/escape is a key factor in current national concerns about student absenteeism and disengagement. Think about 15-year-old “Avery,” who experiences an upset stomach because of test anxiety. Or 16-year-old “Andres,” who puts his head on the table because of frustration with schoolwork. Avoidance/escape can be helpful in situations perceived as threatening or uncontrollable because it prevents harm and provides immediate (albeit temporary) emotional relief. Imagine 14-year-old “Alisha,” who refuses to go to school because of bullies. Or 17-year-old “Amir,” who skips class because of teachers labeling and calling him a “bad kid.” This emotion regulation strategy becomes unhelpful, however, when used excessively. It increases our belief that we can’t handle the situation or that the situation is beyond our control. Students frequently avoid or escape from completing a task that they don’t like doing, or they avoid interacting with others who have done something that hurt or upset them. As an educator, what can you do when your student uses avoidance/escape in an unhelpful manner? Get our essential newsletter featuring must-read articles on the education topics that matter to you—it’s personalized and delivered every Wednesday. You can encourage students to explore their emotions in situations they tend to avoid or escape from. Research on emotionally based school avoidance looks at children and adolescents who have difficulty attending or engaging in school due to negative emotions. Using a mood meter helps students identify their emotions and their energy levels. Aptly called “Name It to Tame It” by Dr. Daniel Siegel, noticing and labeling emotions that are influencing their mind and body enables students to be more aware of and make better sense of their emotions in different situations. Or, you can be a role model by sharing how your own emotions affect the way you think or act and how you use avoidance/escape at times, too (hint: the piled-up laundry). You can also encourage students to reflect on the helpfulness of avoiding or escaping from emotional situations by asking them, “Is it helpful for you to avoid/escape this situation?” If avoidance/escape is perceived to be helpful to students, you can listen to and understand without judgment the ways in which avoidance/escape is helpful to them. This validates their emotions and normalizes their use of the strategy. You can also prompt students to consider the long-term helpfulness of avoidance/escape by asking them, “Would it be helpful for you in the future to keep avoiding/escaping this situation?” Self-reflection facilitates students’ awareness of avoidance/escape behaviors and insight into the utility of such behaviors. Research reveals that understanding why students choose to not attend or engage in school allows a more proactive and targeted approach to increasing school attendance and engagement. If avoidance/escape is perceived not to be helpful to students, you can support them to add or use other strategies in their emotion regulation toolbox, such as problem-solving, reframing, and/or relaxation, to regulate their emotions. Research shows that enhancing students’ emotion regulation improves school attendance and engagement. Take student disengagement, for example—you can use activities that students enjoy as rewards for engaging in activities they enjoy less (problem-solving strategy based on the Premack principle), shift students’ mindset from “I can’t do it” to “I can’t do it yet” (reframing strategy based on Stanford professor Carol Dweck’s growth mindset), and/or choose a reasonable work interval for students and have a break of laughter yoga or mindfulness coloring after each interval (relaxation strategy based on mind-body medicine). You can also support students to gradually confront situations that they tend to avoid or escape from (but do not involve harm) one at a time in manageable chunks. Remember that it’s OK to start with baby steps. For example, students can start with regular practices of one relaxation technique, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. Research demonstrates that gradual exposure builds students’ tolerance to uncomfortable emotions, challenges their dire imagined reality (or worst-case scenario), and boosts their confidence in handling the situation. Using a growth-mindset staircase, you can track students’ progress in approaching an undesired situation by asking them which step they have reached or will reach today. Note that this may be a slow process requiring much scaffolding and positive reinforcement (such as words of encouragement or verbal praise). By guiding and supporting students to better regulate their emotions in both academic and social situations, we can promote and maintain emotional states that enable them to feel better and do better at school and to be part of the solution to the student attendance and engagement crisis."," Students frequently avoid or escape from completing a task that they don’t like doing, or they avoid interacting with others who have done something that hurt or upset them.
