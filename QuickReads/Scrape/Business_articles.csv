Lower palm oil purchases by India, the world’s biggest importer of vegetable oils, could cap the rally in benchmark Malaysian palm oil futures that are trading near their highest in a year. Higher sunflower oil purchases will help to reduce sunflower oil inventories in the Black Sea region. Palm oil imports fell about 2.5% in March from the previous month to stand at 485,354 metric tons, the lowest since May 2023, the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA) said in a statement on Thursday. Falling palm oil stocks in producing countries drove prices higher, prompting Indian buyers to switch from palm oil to sunflower oil, B.V. Mehta, executive director of the SEA, told Reuters. Sunflower oil imports in the month surged about 50% to 445,723 tons, the second highest on record, the SEA said. Crude palm oil (CPO) imports are offered at about $1,040 a metric ton, including cost, insurance and freight (CIF), in India for May delivery, while soyoil and sunflower oil are offered around $1,015 and $975 a ton, respectively, dealers. Soyoil imports in March jumped 26.4% to 218,604 tons from a month earlier, and were far below the monthly average imports of 306,000 tons seen in the last marketing year ended Oct. 31. The higher sunflower oil and soyoil imports lifted India’s total edible oil imports in March to the highest level in six months at 1.149 million tons, up 18.8% from a month earlier, the data showed.

Earlier in January, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) had announced the introduction of a new registration and monthly return filing procedure effective April 1, 2024. The move to overhaul the registration, record-keeping, and monthly filing of such businesses was aimed at improving GST compliance for manufacturers of pan masala and tobacco products. The GST law was also amended via Finance Bill 2024, to say that manufacturers of pan masala, gutka and similar tobacco products will have to pay a penalty of up to Rs 1 lakh, if they fail to register their packing machinery with the GST authorities with effect from April 1. However, this penalty provision is yet to be notified. The procedure was to be applicable for manufacturers of pan-masala, unmanufactured tobacco (without lime tube) with or without brand name, ‘Hookah’ or ‘gudaku’ tobacco, smoking mixtures for pipes and cigarettes, chewing tobacco (without lime tube), filter khaini, jarda scented tobacco, snuff and branded or unbranded ‘Gutkha’, etc. The CBIC, through a notification, extended the date of implementation of this special procedure by 45 days till May 15. The manufacturers of such tobacco products were required to furnish the details of packing machines being used for filling and packing of packages in Form GST SRM-I, electronically within 30 days of the notification coming into effect i.e., April 1, 2024. Also a special statement of return filing GST SRM-II was to be filed by the 10th of the succeeding month.
Moore Singhi Executive Director Rajat Mohan said neither the GST Network has issued any advisory on the new procedure nor released new filing utilities. As a result, the government has decided to defer the implementation of the new procedure by 45 days to May 15. “This delay by the GST ecosystem has led to challenges for the industry in implementing the new scheme mid-year. Ideally, any new scheme should be implemented at the start of a new financial year to allow for smoother transitions and better compliance,” Mohan added. In February last year, the GST Council, chaired by the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising state counterparts, had approved the report of a panel of state finance ministers on plugging tax evasion in pan masala and gutkha businesses. The GoM had recommended that the mechanism for levy of compensation cess on pan masala and chewing tobacco be changed from ad valorem to a specific rate-based levy to boost the first stage collection of the revenue.

Europe is set for a subdued open ahead of the European Central Bank meeting, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures little changed. The ECB is all but certain to hold rates steady but the focus is on whether officials would back a rate cut in June. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.3%, paring some earlier losses, while Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.5%. Chinese shares eked out some gains even as data showed consumer prices in the world’s second-largest economy rose by a muted 0.1% in March from a year ago, versus a 0.7% rise in February. The blue chips rose 0.3% while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.6% thanks to resources stocks. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, however, lost 0.4%. U.S. stock futures were little changed after Wall Street fell around 1% overnight. Treasuries also steadied after yields surged 20 basis points to their highest levels since November. Data overnight showed U.S. inflation in March once again came in hotter than expected, decimating the chance of a rate cut in June. Core CPI advanced 0.4%, above forecasts of a 0.3% rise. Investors, who had been hanging onto the expectation of a June cut, now see September as the most likely timing for the easing cycle to start. The total easing expected this year fell to just 42 basis points, lower than the Fed’s own projection of 75 basis points. The chance of Fed not cutting at all this year rose to 13%, from 2.1% a day earlier, according to CME FedWatch. “While clearly not the data policymakers would be hoping for, for equities things haven’t really changed – the ‘Fed put’ remains well and truly alive,” said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone.
Brown added that should continue to give investors encouragement to move out the risk curve, keeping volatility relatively low, and with dips likely remaining shallow. Fed minutes out overnight also showed that officials had started to worry that inflation progress might have stalled before the March inflation data, with some raising the possibility that the current policy rate was not restrictive enough. Bank of Canada kept its interest rate unchanged overnight, and the bank governor said a cut in June was possible if a recent cooling trend in inflation is sustained. Asian bonds extended the heavy sell-off in Treasuries. The 10-year Australian government bond yield jumped 14.5 basis points to 4.259%, highest since mid-February, while the 10-year Japanese bond yield rose 6 bps to 0.855%, highest since early November. U.S. Treasuries, meanwhile, steadied on Thursday. The benchmark ten-year yield was flat at 4.5416%, having surged 18 bps overnight, and the two-year yield held at 4.9588%, after a rise of 22 bps the previous session. In currencies, the dollar was buoyant at a five-month high against its major peers at 105.14, having surged 1.1% overnight, the biggest daily jump in more than a year. The greenback also hit a 34-year high of 153.24 yen overnight, before easing 0.2% on Thursday to 152.90 yen as the risk of government intervention looms large now that the Japanese currency has weakened past the 152 level. Japan’s top currency diplomat, Masato Kanda, warned on Thursday that authorities would not rule out any steps to respond to disorderly exchange-rate moves. In commodities, metal prices were resilient in the face of a strong dollar while oil held gains after advancing more than 1% following an Israeli strike that killed three sons of a Hamas leader, fuelling worries that ceasefire talks might stall. Brent rose 0.15% to $90.62 a barrel, and U.S. crude was 0.1% higher at $86.33 per barrel.

Those worries took on added urgency following Wednesday’s robust consumer price data: futures markets now show investors expect rates to fall by just 40 basis points this year, compared to 150 basis points priced in at the start of 2024. The fading prospect of rate cuts presents a dilemma to market participants who piled into stocks and bonds over the last few months in hopes of policy easing, leaving some of them scrambling to readjust their portfolios. Though the S&P 500 stands near record highs, some equity investors are loading up on insurance in the options market or pouring money into popular inflation hedges such as energy stocks, wary that a key bull market support may be fading. The index fell nearly 1% on Wednesday. Bond investors are already feeling the pain, as they reposition portfolios amidst a weeks-long selloff that has hammered Treasury prices. Benchmark 10-year yields, which move inversely to bond prices, hit their highest level since November on Wednesday as they breached 4.5%. “We are heading to the possibility of no U.S. rate cuts in 2024, or at least fewer cuts than the market currently prices,” said Tara Hariharan, managing director at global macro hedge fund NWI. Investors cheered when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in December confirmed expectations of a Fed pivot towards rate cuts and policymakers penciled in 75 basis points of borrowing cost reductions for 2024, though that outlook was contingent on inflation continuing to cool. The S&P 500 has added some $4.7 trillion in market value since then and climbed to record highs as investors bet on a so-called soft landing scenario, in which the Fed was able to tame inflation without hurting economic growth. Months of strong data, however, have some investors questioning whether the excitement surrounding a pivot has been premature. Those worries have been readily apparent in the bond market, where yields have been steadily rising in recent weeks. Tim Murray, capital markets strategist at T. Rowe Price, said he has been shifting out of fixed income, wary that a possible inflationary rebound could erode bonds’ future cash flows. “Bonds are a really good recession hedge but they’re not a very good hedge against inflation,” he said. He has also been increasing positions in energy stocks, which have soared along with oil prices and are a popular inflation hedge. The S&P 500 energy sector is up 17% this year, dwarfing the 8.2% rise of the S&P 500. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said he reduced the interest rate exposure of some of the portfolios he runs, including the $2.7 billion BlackRock Flexible Income ETF, over the past few months by selling certain shorter and longer-dated bonds that could be hit harder if rates move higher. U.S. bond giant PIMCO, in contrast, has been raising its interest rate exposure, or duration, believing that bonds have become more fairly priced following their latest selloff. The company trimmed its rate cut forecast last week after strong U.S. labor market data. “If anything, we’re looking potentially at when we should be getting overweight,” said Mike Cudzil, a portfolio manager at the fund. Hariharan, of NWI, said yields on longer-dated U.S. government bonds are “too low given heavy Treasury supply.” Meanwhile, signs of caution are growing in the equity market. Bank of America clients sold a net $3.4 billion in equities last week, with individual stocks seeing their largest outflows since July 2023, the firm said in a note. Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said his firm has been positioned in short-term fixed income as a “parking spot” as it waits for an equities pullback to put money into stocks. “The next move by the Fed is down, but you’re going to have to wait,” he said. Stock investors are also seeking protection in derivatives markets. The Cboe Volatility Index – an options-based gauge of investors’ demand for portfolio protection – is hovering near a two-month high. Citi strategists, analyzing the historic relationship between stocks and yields, said in a note late on Wednesday that it would take the pricing out of approximately 50 to 75 basis points of Fed cuts and for the 10-year yield to rise by between 5 and 35 basis points over the next four to five weeks to badly hurt equities. For Bryant VanCronkhite, senior portfolio manager at asset management firm Allspring, a continued rise in commodity prices could be a major risk for equities, as it could accelerate inflation and price out rate cuts. He believes markets stand at a juncture where it is difficult to predict the next move in stocks. “Quite honestly, I don’t know if it’ll be up 10% or down 10%,” he said.      "," Those worries took on added urgency following Wednesday’s robust consumer price data: futures markets now show investors expect rates to fall by just 40 basis points this year, compared to 150 basis points priced in at the start of 2024.

In the article titled “Markets must stop comparing the UK and the U.S.”, Greene wrote the persistence of inflation is a greater threat for Britain than the U.S. “In my view, rate cuts in the UK should still be a way off as well,” she said.

The BoE policymaker said that difference in labour supply between the two countries is also stark and UK services inflation remains much higher than in the United States. “Overall labour market participation in the UK has not recovered to the pre-pandemic trend. Participation in the U.S., on the other hand, has exceeded the pre-COVID trend.” Higher inflation expectations have translated into higher pay growth, by some metrics now between 6-7% in the UK versus 4-5.5% in the U.S., Greene said adding that it will need to slow further to see services inflation return sustainably to target-consistent levels.

Both contracts rose more than 1% in the prior session after three sons of a Hamas leader were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, feeding worries that ceasefire talks between the two sides might stall. Earlier this week, Israel and Hamas began a fresh round of negotiations in their more than six-month-old Gaza war but those discussions have yielded no agreement. “Prices remain sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, with market participants pricing for the risks of supply disruptions if tensions were to drag for longer,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG. “This aids to offset some risk-off sentiments overnight, as markets recalibrate their rate expectations to price out a June rate cut and for rates to be kept high for longer until September,” added Yeap, referring to U.S. interest rates. Higher-for-longer rates could dampen economic growth and suppress demand for oil. Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve showed officials worried that progress on inflation might have stalled and a longer period of tight monetary policy would be needed to tame inflation in the world’s largest economy. Investors who had earlier expected a rate cut in June now see September as a likelier timing for the easing cycle to begin, following a third straight stronger-than-forecast reading on consumer inflation.
Yeap added that oil’s upward trend may persist as the Middle East geopolitical situation remains tricky. The region is on alert for possible Iranian retaliation over a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s embassy in Syria at the start of the month. A Bloomberg report on Wednesday said the U.S. and its allies believe major missile or drone strikes by Iran or its proxies against Israel are imminent. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that the United States will stand with Israel against any threats by Iran, the U.S. State Department said later on Wednesday. “The market has become increasingly concerned that the Israel-Hamas war could escalate across the Middle East, putting oil supply at risk,” ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said.

The ADB had in December last year projected the Indian economy to expand 6.7 per cent in the 2024-25 fiscal. “The economy grew robustly in fiscal 2023 with strong momentum in manufacturing and services. It will continue to grow rapidly over the forecast horizon. Growth will be driven primarily by robust investment demand and improving consumption demand. Inflation will continue its downward trend in tandem with global trends,” said the April edition of the Asian Development Outlook released on Friday. Growth will be robust despite moderating in FY2024 and FY2025, it said. For the 2025-26 fiscal, the ADB has projected India’s growth at 7.2 per cent. The ADB said exports are likely to be relatively muted this fiscal as growth in major advanced economies slows down but will improve in FY2025. “Monetary policy is expected to remain supportive of growth as inflation abates, while fiscal policy aims for consolidation but retains support for capital investment. On balance, growth is forecast to slow to seven per cent in FY2024 but improve to 7.2 per cent in FY2025,” it said To boost exports in the medium term, India needs greater integration into global value chains, the ADB added. The ADB’s growth forecast for FY25 is in line with the projections made by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI last week had said GDP growth in the current fiscal is projected at seven per cent on expectations of normal monsoon, moderating inflationary pressures and sustained momentum in manufacturing and services sectors.

Equity schemes saw a 16 per cent reduction in month-on-month inflows in the month, the latest data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) showed. Net outflows from the small-cap funds stood at Rs 94.17 crore in March; last time this category saw outflows was in September 2021, to the tune of Rs 248.73 crore. “We have made disclosures and we have also made available information about various stress tests that are done by the (mutual fund) industry. There was a negative reaction from the market (to the stress test results). So, we have seen outflows of Rs 94.17 crore (in March 2024),” said Venkat Chalasani, Chief Executive, AMFI. He said as some of the asset management companies have put restrictions on lump sum flows into small-cap funds, the pace of new flows has also reduced slightly. In March, total inflows into small-cap funds stood at Rs 5,721.99 crore whereas redemption was to the tune of Rs 5,816.16 crore, the AMFI data showed. Last month, the markets regulator, SEBI, and AMFI had asked fund houses to take steps to ensure investors are protected from the froth, which was building up in the small and mid-cap segment. The stress test results for small and mid-cap funds, released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) in March, showed that mutual funds will take at least five days to exit 25 per cent of small-cap funds having assets under management (AUM) of around Rs 5,000 crore, while they may be able to do so between one to three days in case of mid-cap schemes of a similar size. To exit 25 per cent of their small-cap funds with a size below Rs 5,000 crore, fund houses will take up to one to two days, and will require up to a similar time to liquidate mid-cap schemes of the same AUM. “While till February, equity inflows predominantly favoured mid and small-cap funds, we have seen slight halt in March. Many investors gravitated towards small-cap funds, driven by high return prospects, however, a disproportionate allocation to such funds can be risky in the long run,” said Swarup Anand Mohanty, Vice Chairman and CEO, Mirae Asset Investment Managers. He expects a shift towards balanced allocations such as in flexi-cap funds, large cap funds. When asked about the outlook on the inflows into the small-cap funds, Chalasani, said with the markets touching new highs, the flows will continue into such equity schemes. In March 2024, net inflows into equity-oriented schemes declined by 16 per cent to Rs 22,633.15 crore compared to Rs 26,865.78 crore in February. Despite reduction, March was the 37th consecutive month of positive net inflows into equity schemes, starting March 2021. In the January-March 2024 quarter, net inflows into equity mutual funds grew by 36 per cent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 71,279.49 crore, driven by a rally in the stock market. While the Sensex rose by 2 per cent, the NSE’s Nifty 50 climbed around 3 per cent in Q4 FY24. The recent surge in the Sensex and Nifty has been mainly on account of higher inflows from domestic institutional investors (DIIs) that have bought stocks worth Rs 1.12 lakh crore since January this year. In the fiscal ended March 31, 2024, net inflows into equity schemes rose by 26 per cent to Rs 1.84 lakh crore as against Rs 1.47 lakh crore. For FY24, the net asset under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry grew by Rs 14 lakh crore or 35 per cent to Rs 53.4 lakh crore as against Rs 39.4 lakh crore in FY23. In March, the amount collected through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route stood at Rs 19,270.96 crore, a record high, as compared to Rs 19,186.58 crore in the previous month. In March, the number of new SIPs registered were 42,87,117. The number of SIP accounts stood at the highest ever 8,39,71,299 in March 2024 as compared to 8,20,17,700 in February 2024. Among the equity schemes, net inflows into large-cap funds were Rs 2,127.79 crore and into mid-cap was Rs 1,017.69 crore in the last month of FY24. Sectoral/ thematic equity schemes received that highest inflows of Rs 7,917.72 crore. In March, debt-oriented schemes saw outflows of Rs 1.98 lakh crore, which resulted in a month-on-month decline in the net AUM of the industry. Outflows from such schemes was due to the advance tax payment requirement of corporates. “This (outflows from debt mutual funds) is the phenomenon observed in the quarter end and more especially in the year-end,” Chalasani said. Among the debt mutual fund schemes, outflows from liquid funds stood at Rs 1.58 lakh crore; ultra short duration funds at Rs 9,134.95 crore; and money market funds at Rs 8,719.75 crore. Inflows into hybrid funds decreased to Rs 5,583.62 crore in March compared to Rs 18,105.08 crore in February.
