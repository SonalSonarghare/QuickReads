They have had one batsman in Virat Kohli, they really don’t have any quality bowlers, and though Dinesh Karthik stepped up today after a rare Kohli failure to set a 197-run target, the writing was always on the wall, especially with the night dew sweeping in on a flat track. “As a bowling unit, we don’t have many weapons. It then comes down to our batsmen. We lack penetration from a bowling perspective. We batsmen have to get to 220…” Faf du Plessis would echo the worst-kept secret in IPL about his team at the end of a severe hammering. Ishan Kishan kept quiet for the first five balls in the first over of the chase, taking just a single. That was the only time RCB’s bowlers seemed to have a plan with Reece Topley swinging the ball away from the left-hander with a packed off-side field. Ishan must have known that he wouldn’t have to wait for long before RCB themselves opened the floodgates for him and it was Mohammad Siraj who obliged with lots of tripe to threaten his T20 world cup spot. Ishan Kishan & Rohit Sharma are on the charge 💥#MI off to a strong start, 72/0 in the Powerplay 🙌 Watch the match LIVE on @StarSportsIndia and @JioCinema 💻📱#TATAIPL | #MIvRCB pic.twitter.com/0d1ZtS49Ht — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 11, 2024 What’s the ball that Ishan would dream of when he is on just one run from 7 balls in a supposedly big chase? One on the legs, please. Siraj offered two in a row, one of which was thrown back from deep backward square-leg stands. Topley then caught the bug and offered full-pitches that were scythed for three boundaries – one flew past a diving Glenn Maxwell at slips- and Ishan and Mumbai were up and running. Was Siraj done with the gifts? No, for he offered three short balls to Ishan next over, and two sixes and a four resulted. The second six was a beauty: it was short all right but seemingly not much room, but he arched back, created room, and slashed it up and over point. Rohit Sharma’s expression as he walked towards his partner showed how impressed he was with that shot. And when Ishan collected a couple of fours and a six from the final over of powerplay bowled by Maxwell, Mumbai Indians were 72 for 0 and the game was over bar the formalities. One of those formalities was served in some style by Suryakumar Yadav, who was playing his second game of the season and celebrated it with his fastest IPL fifty ever. It was a highlight reel from his past with two shots used liberally. The pulls and the heaves to the leg side regardless of the line of the ball and the sliced drives as he would let his hands fly. The seamer Akash Deep was the one who bled the most, craning his neck to see balls that he thought he had delivered safely outside off disappear to the leg side as Surya unleashed his wristy carnage. Against the left-handed Topley, Suryakumar chose to go on the off side with fierce slices, one of which flew over backward point boundary. Just so that Topley shouldn’t think that he can only carve through the off side, Suryakumar pulled a slower ball over midwicket to bring up the fifty off his 17th delivery. He fell, slapping a full toss from Vijaykumar Vyshak to deep point and even as the DRS reviews were on to check the legality of the ball, Suryakumar sauntered off the field, chuckling away. That’s how intense or rather lack of it was apparent in the 197-run canter of a chase as RCB bowlers tanked collectively.

Jasprit Bumrah had jolted Bangalore by taking out Virat Kohli in the second over of the innings, as the premier RCB batsman went for a big swish across the line and could only feather a nick off the inner edge. Rajat Patidar and du Plessis attempted a brave revival but Patidar fell and Bumrah returned to take out the opposing captain to end with a five-for. It’s not a replay ❌ It’s just @DineshKarthik using his improvisation perfectly 👌 not once but four times. Watch the match LIVE on @JioCinema and @starsportsindia 💻📱#TATAIPL | #MIvRCB pic.twitter.com/IzU1SAqZ6m — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 11, 2024 There were four fours from Karthik in the 16th over off Akash Madhwal and three of those are likely to get a few hits on the IPL site. Each four bested the previous. Each four went to third man, and that direction itself was the chief highlight of the triple strike. The first was a low dipping full toss outside off and Karthik flipped his bat-face towards the off, and scooped it up and to third man boundary, as it was the easiest thing in the world. In hindsight, it was the easiest of the three.  The next ball was wider outside off and landed too, but somehow Karthik not only reached out, but also did the bat-flip at the most opportune time possible to make it a plank for the ball to ricochet off it to third man fence. In the meanwhile, Rohit Sharma, standing at covers, was already agog, trying to catch the attention of his captain Pandya perhaps to have someone plug that hole. Maybe, maybe not. Then came a slower ball from Madhwal but Karthik waited and waited before doing his bat-face-flip to guide it exactly between the two diving men: the wicketkeeper and the short third. There was one more boundary off the last ball as he sliced a full ball to wide third man boundary. All that effort only helped the game a bit longer and allowed the home fans to enjoy a heavy shower of boundaries in the chase.

But in walked Suryakumar Yadav, the Impact sub for MI. After missing the initial round of matches with injury and failing to get off the mark on his return against Delhi Capitals, Suryakumar finally announced his arrival at this edition’s IPL. As has been the case throughout his career, he managed to find boundaries early in his innings and from there on he was simply unstoppable. Mr 360 degree once again showed his range. Those usual scoops behind the wicket came to the forefront again as RCB’s attack failed to offer any challenge, quickly accepting their fate.

First, as Rohit Sharma was getting off the pitch after being dismissed, you could hear a ring of boos that continued as Hardik took his guard. Just when it looked like another round of booing is about to follow, the tone suddenly changed. The 33,000-crowd started chanting Hardik’s name. And soon enough, the MI captain welcomed the chants with a first-ball six over long on. From booing to cheering in the span of a few minutes. Bumrah 1, Kohli 0 Bumrah vs Kohli was supposed to be box-office stuff but it went down rather tamely. For some reason Virat Kohli was looking edgy from the get-go and when he started to shuffle around even to Jasprit Bumrah, the outcome seemed inevitable. He had backed away for a slog and missed. Then a nip-backer hit him on the pad as he tried to flick it rather forcefully. And then he went for a shot that he now and then plays in T20 in the recent years: the slog-swipe to the on side irrespective of the length. Considering that ball wasn’t that short for that shot and even seamed in, it wasn’t a surprise that it caught the inside edge for the wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan to lunge to his left to take the catch. Boom Boom Bumrah!@Jaspritbumrah93 comes into the attack and gets the big wicket of Virat Kohli. Live – https://t.co/7yWt2uizTf #TATAIPL #IPL2024 #MIvRCB pic.twitter.com/1QbRGjV2L0 — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 11, 2024 Patidar pulls not square but over mid-on Rajat Patidar’s pull off Akash Madhwal in the 6th over was interesting. It wasn’t a conventional pull over midwicket or square-leg. He had already seen Kohli perish, trying that pull rather square. And so, Patidar sort of collapsed his arms and wristed it over mid-on. Safe, interesting, and suited for balls that aren’t that short too. It isn’t an on-the-up punch that batsmen occasionally play over the straight infield. Not an easy shot, though, as if the last-instant wrist-scoop doesn’t kick in, it would pop up to mid-on. We have seen Prithvi Shaw play that shot and also fall to that shot. This time around, Patidar managed to pull it off. A 96-metre six of Patidar-Rap As soon as Hardik Pandya released that ball gently on a length, he must have know crack of doom awaits, and Rajat Patidar obliged him. He did that baseball move of his, as he drags his whole weight back and then sashays forward like a baseball hitter. And boy did he whack it. He absolutely walloped it and almost immediately had a glance at his captain and non-striker Faf du Plessis. The white ball kept flying to eventually fall on second tier. And Pandya would signal to no one in particular that he thought the ball would skid on. It did skid off the seats in the crowd though. Of regrets and reverse V shots In his interview on R Ashwin’s YouTube channel, Dinesh Karthik shared many fascinating insights. One of those was the regrets he had from his playing career. “If you had to actually ask me one of my regrets in my cricketing career in respect to IPL, it was the fact that I did not want to get retained in 2013,” he said. The other one was never getting the chance to play for Chennai Super Kings (‘but that I understand,’ he’d add). And on what is likely to be his last appearance at the Wankhede Stadium, DK played a blinder to rescue RCB’s batting against Mumbai Indians. Coming into bat slightly earlier than we are used to seeing him in RCB’s colours, DK took his time to settle in. At one stage, he was on 6 off 9 balls. Then came an over where he played in the V against Akash Madhwal… only this V was behind the wicket, for four fours. Despite RCB losing wickets in a bunch, he powered his side to a decent total with a brilliant 23-ball 53. A knock to be proud of at his former home. Siraj slackening On a night where Jasprit Bumrah made jaws drop, his India new ball partner Mohammed Siraj came up with another below par performance. With every passing outing at this IPL, Siraj is bowling his way out of T20 World Cup contention. Given Mumbai’s batting depth, RCB needed early wickets from Siraj, but once again his limitations in the format — the length he bowls, came to haunt him as Ishan Kishan and Rohit Sharma tore him apart in the powerplay. His economy rate in the powerplay stands at 12.30 this season.

The 17-year-old teenager from India is on top of the standings in the open section at the Candidates chess tournament after drawing with World No 3 Hikaru Nakamura on Thursday. The 17-year-old shares the top spot with Ian Nepomniachtchi, who is in action against Nakamura. Vidit Gujrathi is taking on rank underdog Nijat Abasov while R Praggnanandhaa is up against Fabiano Caruana. In the women’s category, after both Humpy Koneru and Vaishali Rameshbabu lost on Thursday, they’ll be hoping to bounce back against Anna Muzychuk and Lei Tingjie respectively on Friday. Scroll down to check out our live coverage of the seventh round of the Candidates      It's a draw in the Caruana-Praggnanandhaa game after 41 moves. Both players are still in joint third place behind the current leader Nepomniachtchi! Here are all the moves from the Alireza Firouzja vs Gukesh game:  The French GM is under massive time trouble. He needs to make 13 moves in just about 3 minutes! Massive pressure on him there with the game on the line against Gukesh.  Playing with the black pieces, Vaishali has been forced to resign after 36 moves!  Here's how the game played out:  At some point during the Lei Tingjie vs Vaishali Rameshbabu game, we had this interesting position with all four knights sitting on the central squares.   Vaishali has just about 1 minute 30 seconds to make 8 moves now in the game against Lei Tingjie.  After a 40-move tussle against Anna Muzychuk, the veteran Humpy agrees to a draw.  Both players were at the bottom of the standings before the start of the game. Now they have 2.5 points each after 7 rounds.  Here's a look at how the game panned out:  What a battle between Nepo and Nakamura, both on the table and via facial epxressions. But after everything, they agree to a draw. And that means 17-year-old Gukesh can become sole leader at the end of the day if he can defeat Alireza Firouzja.

The French GM is under time pressure now, with Gukesh having almost 25 minutes more on the clock after just 13 moves.  As Nepo takes his time trying to think about his next move, and goes into his customary ""head-down"" napping pose, Irina Krush asks Anand if he ever thought like this on the board.  ""I have looked at the ceiling. But not done the full flat bed,"" quips Anand.   Pragg plays the French against Caruana. And just like the rest of his compatriots in the open section, Pragg is playing with Black! Remember, at the FIDE World Cup, when Pragg had qualified after finishing second, Caruana was one of those he had defeated.  Vidit took four minutes to play his first move, 1...e5 in the game against Abasov, who comes into the game after losing to Vidit's India compatriots Gukesh and Pragg.  With a ranking in triple figures, and a rating of 2632, Abasov was supposed to be the pre-tournament underdog. Then, Abasov also tore his ACL in the months leading to the event.  He only qualified for the Candidates by finishing 4th at 2023 World Cup, thanks to Carlsen refusing to compete at the Candidates. At the World Cup, he went on a giant-killing run despite starting as the 69th seed, defeating the likes of Anish Giri, Peter Svidler (who’s a trainer for Pragg for the Candidates), and Vidit Gujrathi (his opponent today). He’s so far yet to touch the hallowed 2700 rating mark.  Before the event started, Magnus Carlsen had given a brutal prediction for Abasov.  “I think he’s most likely going to suffer. Once you start losing it’s hard to stop the bleeding when you’re a considerably weaker player than the others, which I think Abasov is. He will not have it easy,” he told Chess.com.       The Open section saw a string of great results for Indian chess players. Praggnanandhaa R and Vidit Santosh Gujrathi won their games against Nijat Abasov and Alireza Firouzja respectively. And Gukesh, despite drawing, managed to stay on top of the standings. Praggnanandhaa vs Nijat Abasov Praggnanandhaa joked at the press conference that he’s always trying to play solid but somehow manages to end up in messy double-edged positions. The game against Abasov was another mind-bending one, with numerous beautiful lines that did not appear on the board. The Indian star calculated more precisely than his opponent and was rewarded with a victory, putting him in joint third place. After their extensive analysis, the players agreed that the best try for Black was 34…Be6 instead of 34…g5, to retain greater chances of defending successfully. Praggnanandhaa’s confident answer (“no”) to whether he ever gets tired towards the end of the game with such insane calculations on every move is a clear sign to his rivals that he should not be underestimated.   Vidit Santosh Gujrathi vs Alireza Firouzja By now, we can proclaim Vidit a crowd favourite. With his exciting playstyle, he has been joining the post-game press conferences almost every day, and luckily it was for a good reason today. In his game today against Alireza Firouzja, everything went right for him. The Frenchman chose to play the Sicilian Defence and deviated from the most popular lines, playing 8…Qd8 in the Classical Variation and subsequent moves very quickly. Previously, this has been unsuccessfully tried by Boris Gelfand. Vidit, playing with White, castled long and started to directly attack Black’s king with 13. g4. Firouzja accepted the challenge and responded by taking the pawn on f2 (13…Qxf2). After 17 minutes of careful consideration, Vidit went for a central blow, playing 14. e5 and capturing the pawn back on the next move (15. exd6). With equal material but with vastly more active pieces, White’s position was clearly superior. On move 26, Vidit won an exchange and converted his advantage without great difficulty.  When asked to justify Firouzja’s quick opening play that led to a difficult position, Vidit said: “Probably it’s a bit of tilt. He lost yesterday, he’s on -3, and the tournament is not going his way. It happens; sometimes you become a bit emotional when you’re tilted.” Gukesh vs Hikaru Nakamura Gukesh, one of the two joint tournament leaders, managed to get a completely new position on move seven against Hikaru Nakamura in the Hyperaccelerated Dragon variant of the Sicilian Defense. The game took a quiet path and a draw was a logical result.  “I thought I had a slight pull in the opening, but [his] 14…Nc8 idea was very strong. I could not really see anything for White after that,” commented Gukesh after the game.  Ian Nepomniachtchi vs Fabiano Caruana Ian Nepomniachtchi and Fabiano Caruana played a quiet Four Knights Game, following the well-known line for 10 moves. Nepomniachtchi, playing with White, was mostly expecting a Sicilian Defence from Caruana, as he had already played it twice in this tournament. He tried a new move 16. Re1, but the game nevertheless quickly transformed to a drawish endgame. As the game progressed, the tournament’s co-leader thought that he could press a bit with White and declined a move repetition on move 32. However, Black’s defensive task was not difficult and Caruana found all the right moves to end the game by splitting the point.    (Courtesy FIDE Press) An incredible day at the Candidates ended with six decisive results in eight games. After the women's section saw four draws in Round 5, there were four results in Round 6. Tan Zhongyi vs Anna Muzychuk Tan Zhongyi kept her lead over the rest of the field with a third victory, this time playing with white pieces against Anna Muzychuk. After a few inaccuracies from black, Tan unraveled a strong attack, first leaving her dark-squared bishop up for grabs with 20. Nd4, and then sacrificing her light-squared bishop on h7 on move 28. The position was winning for white, but Tan did not play precisely and gave Muzychuk a chance to escape towards the end of the game. The Ukrainian player, however, did not find the 34…Bxe6 resource in time trouble and resigned soon after. At the press conference, Tan confessed that she was not happy with her calculation during the game and deliberately played quickly at the end to put pressure on Muzychuk’s clock. After Round 6, Tan has won three games and has made three draws. With 4,5 out of 6, she is in clear first place. Aleksandra Goryachkina vs Nurgyul Salimova Aleksandra Goryachkina continues to lead the pack hoping to catch Tan Zhongyi, with a win against Nurgyul Salimova with the black pieces today. At the post-game interview, Goryachkina confessed that it was not a difficult game for her, as everything went smoothly, and she did not give many opportunities for Salimova to create counterplay. Kateryna Lagno vs Vaishali Kateryna Lagno won her first game in the tournament against Vaishali. After a series of disappointing draws, she was happy to have a positive result and was radiating with delight after the game. “When she took the piece on b4 (21. Qxb4), I didn’t think she can hold this position. Maybe she should have played something like 21. Re3, but I think there is 21…Qd1+ 22. Bf1 and 22…Nc2, so this should be already good for me, but I’m not sure if this is winning though,” said Lagno after the game. With 3.5 points, Lagno is now in clear third place.  Lei Tingjie vs Humpy  Lei Tingjie also won today with the black pieces, beating Humpy Koneru. Unfortunately for Humpy, this tournament has not been going well for her so far – she now finds herself at the bottom of the standings. The game was complex but equal up to move 35, when the players entered the endgame. Being low on time, Koneru misplayed the position and allowed her opponent to capture a key pawn on a2, after which Black’s passed pawn on the a-file was unstoppable. With this victory, Lei compensates for her loss in the first round and is now back on an even score.

807,"PV Sindhu’s piling concerns dissected by coach Vimal Kumar: ‘Her reactions need massive improvement, there’s a sudden lack of confidence’",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/pv-sindhu-coach-reactions-lack-confidence-weakness-9264997/,"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/PV-Sindhu-6.jpg?resize=450,253","APRIL 11, 2024","PV Sindhu went down in the second round at the Badminton Asia Championships against Han Yue. Coach Vimal Kumar gives a stern assessment on where she is going wrong at the moment, but believes things will come together.","For a while now, PV Sindhu has been chasing shadows of her own past greatness. She’s simultaneously fleeing daily searing, scything comparisons with a glorious apparition from her own prequel, each time she plays. And is expected to deal with whatever are the diminishing physical powers from age 18 to 28 with a strong mind, because that’s what bonafide champions do. Coach Vimal Kumar, who sat for Sindhu’s last two matches at the Badminton Asia Championships, concedes he doesn’t take the din and fuss of social media where she’s casually scribbled off daily, seriously. And he reckons the frequent dissections of her erratic game, won’t bog Sindhu down. “She’s a top player and will get both criticism and praise obviously. I don’t know how she deals with it, but that shouldn’t be a worry. What I can say is, sweet talk won’t help at this moment. Sometimes, players need a kick on the backside,” he says, adding that Sindhu’s far too good a player to not be bluntly spoken to by her coaches. But Sindhu is India’s only world champion in this sport. And no one is quite equipped to understand how someone who took down a fleet of top Chinese challengers for a large part of the last 10 years, is supposed to cope with suddenly crumbling 18-21, 21-13, 17-21 against a moderately okay-caliber Chinese and stay stoic. Some points on Thursday at Ningbo, China, were silly when not downright sluggish. Sindhu went down to Han Yue in 70 minutes where the quality of her play had more people than Vimal, clucking in vexation. “I’m disappointed,” he said, after the match, as Sindhu wasted a fine 11-5 and 15-10 start in the opener to fritter 6 points, fall back, then force a decider, and promptly fizzle out after leading 8-4 in the third. Vimal had told her after her laboured first-round win against Goh Jin Wei, “Your tendency is to start with a poor match in opening rounds but come through from there on. Today she started well too, and both opponents were not of her calibre so she should’ve won in straight sets. But there’s a sudden lack of confidence that wasn’t there a month and half ago,” he adds. Sindhu’s more overwhelming tendency these days has been to cede points in a clump – both Set 1 and 3, she lost 6 on the trot between points 10 to 17. She also picked up 6 in a row in the second, but that makes her patchy play even more pronounced. Vimal breaks it down, brutally too. “Her reactions need massive improvement, she’s not responding quickly. And shot selection is very poor. In practice when I watch her, she has great variety. But she’s not implementing it in matches at all,” he says. In the last few tournaments, she’s flown off the lid too while the game retreats into a shell. “The body language is poor and she gets very desperate to pick points and anxiety is draining her out greatly,” he explained. The culprit on this day was her predictable strokes, when Han Yue would max out her slight deception in hold-and-flicks. Sindhu wanted to assert herself at the net, but beyond the aggression, there wasn’t too much construction of a cunning point. She would blindly push the shuttle to different corners, getting her lengths and judgments all wrong on when to play straight or cross or opt for the tumble. The net decision-making was in shambles, reckons Vimal. Sindhu had appeared far too tight and wasn’t playing too freely both days, Vimal says. “She’s way better than these girls. But they were anticipating her easily. Her choices were predictable. If they played down her left, she would flick it cross and Han was literally waiting for her to do that,” he said. Sindhu also stuck to a playing-downward metronome unceasingly, instead of trying attacking punch clears, he said. At one point, he was hoping Sindhu would push the pace, but it was the Chinese who took control of the cadence of the rally, dictating speed. “She has everything in her game. She has the net strokes. She thinks maybe her fitness is not good enough, but I don’t think that’s the case at all. She’s fit, but not applying herself on court, and low on confidence,” Vimal says. “Prakash (Padukone) and Agus (Dwi Santoso) will look into her sessions well I’m sure, but no amount of training will help if she doesn’t play fearlessly.” Sindhu will have to make her own breaks, he stresses because luck runs out faster than anyone can guess. “She was late for every return and the footspeed does need to go up. She was playing really well in February,” he stresses. “She has to make it happen for herself and can’t wait for fortune to favour her. There are people to help her, and she’s a very good player. All she can do is try and have a go at it,” he says. While Vimal reckons it might be too late now, he believes Sindhu ought to have played the Uber Cup, to get good quality matches against the No 1s of top nations under her belt. “Win or lose, she would’ve faced a different player which is good for her and would’ve tested her. And the only way to gain confidence is by playing those tough matches. I would’ve preferred she thought of it deeply and rationally,” he stated. Vimal however wasn’t too cognizant of how much the piling criticism with each loss can drag her further down mentally, and admitted it was her call as top player to decide in an Olympic year.  Sindhu’s struggles are finding outlets in aggression, but not necessarily in a well-thought-out game. “She’s a softer personality than Saina. They are different. Yes, she’s playing a little too emotionally, but it’s not a major issue. Her game has everything, it will come together,” he hopes, adding her attack is formidable enough to not need fake fierceness.

It allowed 64-year-old Sunil Bhatia and his wife Renu to drive from their home in Raleigh, North Carolina to Augusta to be with their son at the year’s first golf Major. Akshay had been marked as a prodigy for years and was even part of the Drive, Chip and Putt Competition, the informal event held earlier in the Masters week, in 2014, finishing sixth before watching the practice rounds from the stands. “Those memories are fresh in our minds. Akshay was as excited as anybody to get a chance to play at the course. When he watched the practice rounds from outside the ropes, he wanted to get inside and play with the world’s best golfers. To walk all the 18 holes to watch Akshay play at the same course is a special feeling for all of us,” Sunil told The Indian Express on his way to Augusta. Akshay was born in Northridge, California, and would grow up in Santa Clarita in the same state before the family relocated to Raleigh to support the golfing dreams of Akshay and his elder sister Rhea. While Sunil, who was born in London and has roots in New Delhi, worked in real estate business, Renu, who has her roots in Hyderabad, ran a golf catering company apart from working in a cruise liner ticketing agency. A young Akshay often accompanied his father to Wakefield Golf Club, where he is now an honorary member, and played with his plastic drivers and putter before getting his first golf set at the age of 10. Rhea played collegiate golf at Queens University in Charlotte and the family would drive to nearby clubs to let the kids play full rounds. “When your kids want to play golf, as parents your job is to support them and make whatever sacrifices you can make. The average monthly membership fee for one golfer was 200 dollars apart from the 80-100 dollars for every tournament they played. Sometimes, we spent more than 13 hours in a day with Akshay as he played two rounds of golf and then drove him back home,” remembers Renu. He even shifted to home-schooling in sixth grade so that he could focus on golf. Sunil remembers his son waking him up at 1 a.m once to ask how he could become the best golfer in the world. “I told him to sleep as he had school the next day. At breakfast, I told him that if he was the first person at practice and the last one to leave the golf club, it would make him a better golfer and a better person,” shared the father. In 2016, Akshay became the American Junior Golf Amateur champion before achieving the rare feat of winning the PGA Junior Championship two years in a row in 2017 and 2018. Being part of US teams for the Junior Presidents Cup and Junior Ryder Cup, Akshay also won the Youth Olympics silver medal in Argentina in 2018. His first appearance on the PGA Tour came in 2017 as an amateur before turning pro in 2019, at the age of 17, with a sponsor exemption at the Valspar Open in Florida. Success didn’t come instantly and all seven starts with the exemption ended in missed cust. It was only last year that he won his maiden PGA Tour title at the Baracuda Championship, pocketing a cheque of $6,84,000. Last week’s win at the Texas Open brought the biggest prize money of his career – 1.6 million dollars. “We were not there to watch him win the Barracuda Open as he wanted us to be with his goldendoodle dogs Torrey and Gooshoo,” says Sunil. In 2021, Akshay had spent a couple of days training with Phil Mickelson and shared his thoughts with this paper about spending time with the golfing great. “To train and to be under the mentorship of Phil is tremendous. I see him as a mentor, friend and big brother and he does a lot for me. To see one of the legends of the game care about a 19-year-old kid is really cool. He has helped with my chipping and my understanding of the short game and course management,” Akshay had said. Fellow Indian origin golfer Sahith Thageela would be competing in his second Masters this week. “I don’t know if I quite realise what Sahith and I can do for golf in India. I think it’s awesome just being able to grow the game and not just in the States, but in India,” Akshay told the media at Augusta earlier this week.  As for his parents, they hope that their son will get a chance to host the Masters Champions dinner some day. “He loves butter chicken as well as Korean food. So we know what will be his choice for the Masters Champions dinner if he wins the title some day,” shares Renu.

809,‘Rohit is out .. Mumbai will lose’: The comment that killed a Kolhapur IPL fan,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/ipl/rohit-out-mumbai-will-lose-comment-that-killed-kolhapur-ipl-fan-9264893/,"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/IPL-fan-death.jpg?resize=450,253","APRIL 12, 2024",IPL rivalry turns deadly in remote Maharashtra village as 65-year-old dies in fight with neighbour,"A woman’s wail pierces the narrow, winding lane at the end of which sit two houses separated only by a thin wall. The front door of one shack is bolted. Inside the adjacent home, a young man – head shaven, eyes moist and legs folded – sits on the floor in silence. In a room, village elders console his weeping mother. It’s Padwa, the first day of the New Year, but the woman can’t gather herself to forget the past and look forward to a new beginning. Inside her modest home, and on the streets outside, they are still mourning the passing of Bandopant Tibile. The 65-year-old died on March 30 – two days after he was seriously injured in a fight with his neighbour, 70-year-old Balwant Jhanjge, while watching an Indian Premier League (IPL) match on TV from their small Maharashtra village. Tibile’s son Vijay fights back tears as he says: “They were watching a match. The argument broke out because of an incident in a match. The biggest lesson is to not get too involved emotionally in cricket. When will we treat sport as sport?” It’s a question many have been asking lately. Since the start of this IPL season, social media has witnessed toxic battles between fans of Hardik Pandya and Rohit Sharma, the new Mumbai Indians captain vs his predecessor. Rivalry between fans of different teams always existed, but animosity between those idolising individual cricketers enjoying cult following is a recent trend in Indian cricket. In a much-debated transfer, Pandya had moved to MI from Gujarat Titans before the current season. This came within days of the Rohit-led Indian team finishing runners-up in the 2023 ICC World Cup. Pandya was booed during his first home game at Wankhede Stadium, and policemen in civil clothes were posted near the dugout where he sat with his teammates. It was during MI’s previous game, an away outing in Hyderabad, that the elderly farmer was killed for simply saying ‘Mumbai Indians will lose’. This was the real world, miles away from the glittering IPL stadiums. The tragedy has stunned Hanmantwadi, a village of a few thousand on the outskirts of Kolhapur, and left its inhabitants speechless. “It’s a modest village with people who are farmers with modest lands and meagre earnings. We are far away from the hustle of big cities. It’s an uncomplicated, peaceful life,” says Sangram Bhapkar, the sarpanch. The village itself is in the back of beyond and it’s an ordeal just to reach here – half a day from Mumbai or Pune, the two nearest major cities, to get to Kolhapur followed by another long journey to Hanmantwadi, where autos are often reluctant to travel because of the distance and buses are infrequent. The region’s sporting interests, too, are different from most of India. While cricket remains the undisputed number one in most parts of the country, here, football can rival it in popularity and practice. On the face of it, Hanmantwadi – or Kolhapur in general – doesn’t have skin in the IPL game. There isn’t any team representing the region nor has a player from here made it that far. Yet, such is the IPL’s lure that it has everyone hooked. Just last week, a fruit seller outside Shahu Market Yard won the jackpot of Rs 1 crore in a fantasy game. Ravi Jadhav, the police patil, says: “Cricket has always been popular but in the last few years, IPL madness has reached unimaginable levels. People identify themselves as Mumbai Indians or Chennai diehards. People put it as their status messages. Cricket is one part but the IPL khunnas (hatred) is a new thing.” Jadhav lives a few blocks away from the houses of the victim, Tibile, and the accused, Jhanjge. Until a fortnight ago, he says, the two neighbours lived as neighbours normally do – caring and peaceful for the most part, nosy and nagging sometimes. Tibile, the village residents say, was active socially and used to be the first to help anyone in need. Jhanjge, they say, was a little “whimsical”, but it was all “minor”. As they frequently did, on March 27, Tibile and Jhanjge met at a friend’s home across the street to watch IPL. They were joined by half a dozen others, who gathered around a tiny, antiquated box television set to watch the MI-SRH face-off. It was a high-scoring match, Hyderabad would set Mumbai a humongous target of 278. Mumbai made a brisk start, but when Rohit Sharma got dismissed, Tibile taunted Jhanjge, a die-hard Mumbai Indians fan. “After the wicket, Tibile turned to Jhanjge and said, “Oh, Rohit is out, now Mumbai will lose!” recalls Bhapkar. “That triggered Jhanjge and the duo got involved in a heated argument.” What started as banter turned into a full-fledged bashing of Tibile, who was thrashed with sticks. Some local residents tried to intervene, but out of nowhere, Jhanjge’s nephew Sagar emerged and landed a blow with a stick on the back of Tibile’s head. Tibile collapsed on the door of his house and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Two days later, he was declared dead. “There was no other angle to their fight. No prior enmity, no fuss over anything else. Cricket is the reason for what happened. But the incident was just an accident,” sarpanch Bhapkar says. Jhanjge and his nephew have been booked under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. The two families got together and ensured things did not spiral out of control within the village. It has left everyone, including the police, shocked. “We aren’t talking about youngsters. It’s two aged people who got involved in a fight that led to this tragic incident over a cricket match,” says Inspector Kishor Shinde of Karveer police station.  Subsequently, the police held a meeting, Shinde says, and decided to start an awareness programme among the villagers. “How much should one be obsessed about a particular thing? There has to be a limit. You can’t develop enmity towards others because of it. People get depressed too if their team loses, as if someone has died. How can it be addressed? Should the BCCI be responsible for educating the fans? Or the government?” Shinde adds: “Earlier, entertainment used to come in the form of movies that we saw in cinema halls. It used to be a community affair. The IPL now is a similar thing. Watching matches is a community event but we must not forget that it is just entertainment. We must treat it like that.” Get latest updates on IPL 2024 from IPL Points Table to Teams, Schedule, Most Runs and Most Wickets along with live score updates for all matches.

Here's why this move is considered historic for the Summer Games.","When a track and field athlete stands on the top of the Olympic podium in Paris this summer, a gold medal will not be their only prize. For the first time, they will also be rewarded with a cheque. On Saturday, World Athletics announced a cash prize of $50,000 (approx Rs 41.6 lakh) for each gold medal winner at the Paris Olympics, which begins on July 26. Four years later, at the Los Angeles Games, all three medal winners will receive monetary benefits in addition to a medal, the global body announced. With this decision, the body headed by British track and field legend Sebastian Coe partially shattered one long-standing myth that is often romanticised about the Olympics – that the athletes, unlike in other sports, are amateurs. A new milestone for our sport 🏟️ World Athletics becomes the first international federation to award prize money at the Olympic Games. Take a look at some of the other major athletics milestones at the Olympics. Press Release 🔗 https://t.co/8OZAwlJy5W pic.twitter.com/luNjZ9lhHP — World Athletics (@WorldAthletics) April 10, 2024 In tennis, football or cricket, athletes are paid to play matches and rewarded with hefty bonuses and cash prizes based on their performances. Sportspersons competing at the Olympics are held to a higher standard and expected to maintain the tradition where they compete to uphold the ‘spirit’ of the Games. This concept was put forward by Frenchman Pierre de Coubertin, the father of the modern Olympics, who said that amateurism was essential to the Olympic movement. For half a century, it remained like that. The International Olympic Committee even punished athletes who were caught receiving money. One of the classic examples of this remains that of the USA’s Jim Thorpe. The pentathlete and decathlete was stripped of his gold medals in the two events in 1912 after it was found that he received tiny payments from a baseball player two years before the Olympics. Gradually, over the decades the IOC loosened its position on the issue of Olympic athletes not getting paid at all. The shift began in 1971 when it was alleged that the Soviets financially supported their athletes and by the time the 1992 Olympics came, the concept was done away with after the USA fielded its ‘Dream Team’ – some of the world’s highest-paid athletes who played in a professional league. Yet, till today the athletes do not get directly paid for turning up or winning at the Olympics, unless it’s from their sponsors or the respective governments. This has been a friction point for a while. World Athletics introduces prize money for Olympic gold medallists at Paris 2024, and all medallists from LA28. — World Athletics (@WorldAthletics) April 10, 2024 For years, it’s been held that while almost everyone else involved in the Olympic movement make money off it, the key actors – athletes themselves – aren’t paid for their roles. Even the Olympic bosses – from the IOC president to members to executive board officials – make between $450 to $900 per day while on official business. The IOC said it redistributes 90 percent of the billions of dollars it makes in revenue back into sport. However, an Inside The Games report suggested that a fraction of it goes back to athletes. A major chunk of the money is distributed among the international federations and other IOC operations. The International Federations are placed in different brackets, depending on their performance at a Games that is determined using various parameters, and the revenue is distributed accordingly. For instance, according to a 2019 report in the Olympic watchdog website Play The Game, athletics, gymnastics and aquatics were placed in Group A and were entitled to receive $40 million each from the IOC. The lowest category was E, where golf, modern pentathlon and rugby were grouped with each getting $ 14.10 million. More than 50 percent of these federations depend on the IOC dole to carry out their basic functions and hence are left with very little money to distribute among the athletes as prize money. It leaves athletes in a precarious position. An Indian Express investigation earlier this year showed that the majority of India’s athletes depend on government jobs for income to sustain their sporting careers. After the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) awarded Rs 75 lakh to gold medal winners, Rs 40 lakh to the silver winners and Rs 25 lakh for those who won bronze. Before the Tokyo Games, NBC reported that more than half of the USA’s Olympic hopefuls – 59 percent – made ‘less than $25,000 during the year of their respective Olympics’, be it the Winter or Summer Games. Although a majority of federations might not be able to afford something like this, given they do not have $2.4 million which a body like the World Athletics can spare. By doing so, the Guardian noted that Coe-led World Athletics also highlighted ‘the fact (that) in the 128-year history of the Games it (IOC) has never paid its stars to compete in the biggest sporting show of all.’ And that is the sports politics side of this. Coe is among the candidates to succeed Thomas Bach as the IOC president when the German’s term gets over next year. This is Coe’s way of giving the athletes their due.  The amount offered might not be much – a Neeraj Chopra might make more from a 10-second commercial. But the message isn’t lost. As Chopra said, “Money-wise in athletics, there isn’t the kind of money that is in tennis or football among other sports. World Athletics’ decision to announce prize money for gold-winning athletes at the Paris Olympics is a good start. It’s a good addition.”   "," On Saturday, World Athletics announced a cash prize of $50,000 (approx Rs 41.6 lakh) for each gold medal winner at the Paris Olympics, which begins on July 26.

You see his career just stands as the most amazing tournament rap sheet. The innings he played us against us in Mohali in the 2016 T20 World Cup is the most amazing innings I’ve had played against me. It changed the face of the whole game. He was hitting balls to different areas on a wicket that was inconsistent. He had the ability to change his hands position at the last moment and flick it almost like a table tennis bat and time it into the gap or over the fences. It’s something that’s unmatched around the world. His awareness is phenomenal,” Maxwell recalled in ESPN’s Around The Wicket Show. “It’s been amazing to train alongside him and watch him go about it.
