On the face of it, Jonny Bairstow is a curious player. When he doesn’t click he can be very frustrating to watch. But when he does, just like he did on Friday night at the Eden Gardens, there’s rarely a cleaner hitter of the ball in T20s. After returning to the Punjab’s starting XI after being dropped for the last two matches, the English opener smashed the KKR pace battery to smithereens. He took 24 runs off the last over of the powerplay as Punjab reached 93/1 after the first 6 overs, improving upon their KKR counterparts’ 76/0 in the first innings.And the chase was well and truly on. Bairstow would not relent as the innings progressed, getting to his 50 from 23 balls as he all but silenced a 55k-strong home crowd at the iconic Eden Gardens. With the pace attack faltering, Shreyas Iyer introduced Varun Chakaravarthy but the opener would not be denied, as he nonchalantly hit the mystery spinner for 17 runs in the 11th over as Punjab brought up their 150 in the very next one. Even the usually potent Andre Russell wasn’t safe from the Bairstow blitzkrieg as he smashed 24 runs off the 12th over and then brought up his ton in 45 deliveries. He was ably supported by Shashank Singh with whom Bairstow brought up a 50-run partnership off just 27 deliveries as Punjab reached the target of 262 with eight balls to spare, making it the highest successful run chase in all T20s. Shashank, who has been the find of the season for Punjab, also did his part with a quickfire 67 off 27 after Rilee Rossouw was dismissed in the 13th over for 26. With his innings, which came at a crucial stage when Bairstow was appearing to run out of gas, ensured there was no comeback for Kolkata. Earlier, it was Prabhsimran Singh who started it all, bringing up his half century in just 18 balls before being run out as Punjab went all hell for leather from the word go in the chase of a steep target. In a hot, sticky, energy-sapping evening in Kolkata, Punjab Kings skipper Sam Curran chose to have a bowl after winning the toss. But his bowlers were bled dry by Kolkata’s opening pair Sunil Narine and Phil Salt, who brought up a 138-run partnership. To make matters worse, the Punjab bowlers weren’t helped by some really subpar fielding which saw both openers dropped thrice inside the first 10 overs. Since getting promoted to the opener slot again this season, opposition attacks are yet to find a way to stop the carnage from Narine. Even the best player of the 2022 T20 World Cup, Curran felt his wrath when he saw the first delivery he bowled to Narine getting slashed for a four. Same happened with Arshdeep Singh in the second over as the West Indies all-rounder nonchalantly pulled him for a six over square leg. He would reach his half century in just 23 balls before ultimately getting dismissed for 71 off Rahul Chahar. His knock had four sixes and nine boundaries. The carnage continued with his opening partner Phil Salt, who after quiet first 2 overs where he scored 2 runs from 5, signalled his intent by smashing Harshal Patel for two sixes and a four, marauding 18 from the third over. Even Kagiso Rabada wasn’t spared as both openers made him look absolutely ordinary with KKR reaching 50 in just 3.5 overs, 21 runs of which came from his first over. As the powerplay ended, Kolkata had reached 76/0 with Punjab already having a huge mountain to scale. From there on with their fielders not making it any easy, Punjab’s attack struggled to stream to the run flow as Kolkata’s 100 came up in the 8th over. The Englishman would also get his half century off just 25 as the hapless Punjab bowlers searched for a breakthrough. In all, Salt six sixes and as many boundaries. There wasn’t any let up for Punjab as the evening progressed with the bowlers gradually losing the plot as Kolkata batsmen made merry, posting 137/0 after 10 overs. Curran would strike in the 13th over, cleaning up Salt for 75 but the flow of runs was not stemmed with KKR opting to send Andre Russell up the order at number 4. The burly striker would start his innings by playing a well-timed shot which required him to arch his body and send the delivery to the third man boundary. He would build on that with a six off the 15th over bowled by Harpreet Brar as Punjab’s strategy to stifle KKR in the middle overs didn’t really pan out. Russell survived a thick edge which wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma failed to catch and it reached the boundary to bring up KKR’s 200 in the 16th over. The West Indies allrounder would perish in the very same over, having made24 off 12. Shreyas Iyer would replace him in the middle scoring 28 off 10 deliveries with three sixes and a four off the 18th before falling in the next one. The Knights would ultimately post 261/6, the highest-ever IPL score at the Eden Gardens. But little did they know at the half-way stage that the record would be surpassed within a couple of hours and eight balls to spare.

His partner and chief architect of the chase, Jonny Bairstow soon embraced. In a trice, ecstatic teammates piled on in cathartic joy. It has been a difficult season for Punjab Kings, having lost six of their eight encounters before this. But here they pulled off the highest run chase ever in this format, with eight balls to spare no less. The Eden Gardens crowd stood and stared shocked, wanting to celebrate the moment yet mourn their team’s defeat. They recovered from the initial jolt and gamely applauded Punjab Kings. A gutted Shreyas Iyer, the KKR captain, would tell the host broadcasters: “Both teams played tremendously. You have to go back to the drawing board and see where you went wrong. Not defending hurts but it’s a great lesson for the players.” Shashank, who leathered 68 off 28 balls, choked for words as he explained his methods. It was just another league game, but the mood was akin to a big knockout match that had just gotten over. Then again, every day, teams don’t chase down 262 in this format. It’s a night to celebrate the game as much as the record chase. .@PunjabKingsIPL are roaring again 🦁 A special victory at the Eden Gardens for #PBKS who secure the highest successful run chase in the IPL and T20s ❤️ Scorecard ▶️ https://t.co/T9DxmbgIWu#TATAIPL | #KKRvPBKS pic.twitter.com/FNxVD8ZeW6 — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 26, 2024 Prabhsimran Singh had developed an unfortunate habit. Frequently used as the Impact Player by Punjab Kings, he almost always comes out to bat, goes bang-bang, then gets out in the 20s and 30s. Of the 8 innings before Friday night in Kolkata, Prabhsimran crossed 19 five times but didn’t cross 35. At Eden Gardens though, he seemed to put it right in some style. He took Punjab to a blistering start, smashing Harshit Rana, Dushmantha Chameera, Anukul Roy in the powerplay. Then came Sunil Narine, and Prabhsimran welcomed him with a four and six. The 20-ball 54 was a brilliant knock… but it came to an end with a run out at the end of 24-run over. Jonny Bairstow smashed Anukul Roy 4-6-4-4-6 but off the last ball, took off for a single that saw Prabhsimran fall short thanks to a Narine direct hit. As he walked off, he put the bat face close to his helmet grille and roared in frustration. A soft end after a stunning start. Sam Curran has developed so many slower-ball variations that he rarely nudged 130kph, let alone 140 which once he regularly clocked. But for once, he was forced to rev up his pace and was indeed rewarded. Phil Salt had clouted him for a pair of flat sixes, both off slower balls. The first one hovered around the 115kph mark, the second even slower at 109 kph. Salt would judge the length and just swing through the line. Curran had already conceded 30 runs in 14 balls and he wanted a shot at redemption. He reverted to his biggest strength, that is to bowl a yorker at full-pelt. The ball only measured 131 clicks on the speedo, but it was pinpoint accurate. The ball drifted in a tad from his wrists, and upon landing, block-hole or thereabouts straightened to blast the off-stump. The batsman was beaten chiefly for pace. Perhaps this is his new trick—reverse the routine. Batsmen are expecting him to take the pace off the ball. So slip one faster, and beat them for pace. It worked. Punjab Kings needed to break the KKR opening partnership early. Phil Salt and Sunil Narine have been key to Kolkata’s fast starts eventually ending up in big totals but with their all-out attacking approach, there is also the downside of giving opportunities for the opponents. Punjab actually did well to create these chances. But unfortunately, they came to Eden Gardens with butter fingers. Narine was dropped by Harpreet Brar as early as the third over. Then Salt was put down twice, one an absolute sitter by Sam Curran. The openers went on to add 138 for the first wicket. Then Andre Rusell was given a life too. A smart field placement saw Arshdeep bowl with a fine fly slip but the outside edge that was heading straight into the hands, but gloved away by a diving Jitesh Sharma. Fortunately, this time around, DreRuss was out the next ball as Arshdeep bowled a bouncer. Harshal did take the catch this time. In an otherwise all-out attacking approach KKR have adopted for this season, Shreyas Iyer has been going slow in the middle order. After starting the season with a 24-ball 39, Shreyas either played short cameos or dropped anchor. There was a 32-ball 34, a 38-ball 38 and a 36-ball 50 thrown into the mix. So it was a little bit of a surprise that he came out to bat in the 16h over when DreRuss got out. The first thought was it would have been the ideal entry point for finisher Rinku Singh. But after struggling with the short balls early on, Shreyas went out all guns blazing this time around. He smashed a 10-ball 28, with intent to go big without taking his time to settle in. Sure, the match situation helped but still, it was a welcome display of aggression from the KKR captain that hasn’t been seen too frequently this year. Amidst Shreyas Iyer’s carnage of Sam Curran—6,4, 6, 6— one stroke stood out for its impossible trajectory. The second six, a flick that was both brutal and beautiful. Iyer had premeditated and moved across, assuming that Curran would spear a wide yorker. But he bowled full on middle and leg stump. So Iyer had to readjust. He did so by keeping his front-leg upright, his back knee bent a touch, careful that it did not slide further away, which could have obstructed the path of the bat. It was an awkward pose, but he kept his poise, and let those malleable wrists twist and close and take the ball to the stands over deep midwicket, all the while standing tall and not bending forward as most batsmen naturally do when flicking, Watch out for the snapping wrists, that imparts direction onto the ball. Iyer loved the shot, as he watched it’s stand-ward ascent.

He turned behind and celebrated, pointing to his teammates who soon mobbed him in the middle. A new World Champion was crowned, and India became only the sixth different country to lift the prestigious Thomas Cup since its inception in 1949. In Chengdu, starting Saturday, the Band of Brothers that triumphed in Bangkok, will begin their campaign to defend that title. It is almost entirely the same set of players who are tasked with that challenge. The group believed they are capable of winning the title much before Bangkok 2022 as the now-famous Whatsapp group ‘It’s coming home!’ was created. A medal seemed possible from the word go, but they defied the odds to go all the way, blanking the most successful side in the history of the tournament in the final. Now, as champions, they will have a target on their backs. Winning it once was a big deal, defending the title is going to be much tougher in what seems to be a very open race too. Hosts China will go all out, Indonesia will be raring to put 2022 behind them and have players hitting some terrific form, Denmark and Japan will fancy their chances too and watch out for Chinese Taipei, who are capable of doing what India did last time. India will again be in the mix. Indian badminton found its love for team events at the last Thomas Cup and talent wise, there is no reason to put a repeat past them. Coach Vimal Kumar, who hailed it as the country’s greatest achievement, said that day it was “an achievement of pure team spirit which I haven’t seen in the past.” India have boasted of some star singles players over the last two decades, but to come together in a team event like they did was a sensational achievement. Since then, there have been medals in other team events too like the Asian Games men’s team event and the Badminton Asia Team Championships. 𝗟𝗢𝗢𝗞𝗕𝗔𝗖𝗞: 2⃣0⃣2⃣2⃣ #ThomasUberCupFinals#ThomasCup 𝙁𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙡 This is how 🇮🇳 sealed their first-ever triumph in the competition. 👏 pic.twitter.com/tEqdDkAeGp — BWF (@bwfmedia) April 26, 2024 While the personnel India will be employing over the next few days is simliar, the roles are likely to be rejigged. HS Prannoy’s presence as the third singles player was a crucial factor in Bangkok, but this time he is the top-ranked Indian singles player and will have to shoulder a different, tougher burden. If picked, he will play the opponent’s toughest players. While at his best, Prannoy can beat anyone in the world – even Viktor Axelsen, as he has shown in the last few years – his 2024 has been off to a rough start. With older health issues resurfacing, he hasn’t hit the highs of 2023, although the signs were good at the Asian Championships. Lakshya Sen was flying high in 2022, but things have not been easy for him since. His Paris 2024 dreams looked distant at the start of this year, but the Almora kid climbed this hill in the nick of time, putting together crucial runs in Europe. In 2022, Srikanth Kidambi played arguably the best badminton of his career since the remarkable 2017 season, going undefeated in Bangkok. This time – if picked as the third singles player – he will have to overcome patchy form and step up under high pressure in deciding fifth matches. Priyanshu Rajawat was a rookie in Bangkok as he soaked in the experience, but is now more than a viable option for the third singles slot, should India seek to rotate. In men’s doubles, MR Arjun and Dhruv Kapila’s fortunes nosedived post-2022 mostly due to injuries, but they have hit some good form recently. The one thing that hasn’t changed, however, is the form of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, if anything they have gone on to become world-beaters. Currently world No 3, SatChi will have to spearhead India’s challenge as a bankable win in every tie they play. India’s opponents in Group C will first be Kunlavut Vitidsarn-led Thailand. The world champion could well give his side a winning start but the depth on paper is much better for India, with Thailand not having their best second singles or main doubles options. England is next, and that should be winnable too. Then comes the grudge match against Indonesia, who have their main singles players Jonatan Christie and Anthony Ginting in great form, and despite their legendary doubles players missing, possess great depth there too. Being played so close to Paris 2024, there is also the question of how much teams will push in Chengdu. Some teams have withdrawn, while others have not sent their full strength teams (like Indian women in the Uber Cup). But, Race to Paris now in the rearview mirror, India have made their intentions for Thomas Cup clear by opting for the big guns. And at a team event, all it could take is a spark, leaning on teammates to overturn tough situations. The early signs are similar in Chengdu as in Bangkok, as the team has been projecting confidence and team spirit. “Rok sako toh rok lo,” seems to be the rallying cry. Even though defending the famous trophy will be daunting, the group that made history are striking a defiant note. Indian women gained automatic qualification for the Uber Cup 2024 Finals after a sensational week at the Badminton Asia Team Championships in Malaysia earlier this year. A semifinal spot would have assured them their spot but they went the distance to clinch the title, overcoming a series of higher-ranked opponents. That title, albeit in a depleted field, was a shot in the arm for the women’s badminton contingent in the country, where the big wins have often come in individual tournaments. It marked PV Sindhu’s comeback to action from an injury break, but was made memorable by Anmol Kharb’s incredible arrival on the big stage. But in Chengdu, as Uber Cup gets underway on Saturday, India will unlikely build on that success in Shah Alam. A medal at the World Team Championships wouldn’t have been easy anyway, but it became improbable when Sindhu, Tanisha Crasto-Ashwini Ponnappa, Treesa Jolly-Gayatri Gopichand opted out. “Sindhu informed the selectors that due to back-to-back tournaments leading up to the Olympics, she and her team have decided to skip the Uber Cup to prepare for the Olympics Top doubles pairs also cited similar reasons and, since it is not a full-strength team, they also pulled out. The selectors then decided to go ahead with young players who have done well recently at the National Championships,” BAI had said in a statement while announcing the squad. And so the mercurial lefty Ashmita Chaliha will lead a young Indian team, that could still stand an outside chance at getting out of Group A in second place. China will be the overwhelming favourites in the group but against Canada and Singapore, India can’t be written off. The crucial tie would be the opener on Saturday against Michelle Li’s Canada. National champion Anmol, who stole headlines at BATC, will get another chance to go toe-to-toe with some more higher-ranked opponents while Tanvi Sharma is another teenager to keep an eye out on. Shruti Mishra-Priya Konjengbam and Simran Singhi-Ritika Thaker will shoulder doubles responsibilities. Thomas Cup squad: (Singles) HS Prannoy, Lakshya Sen, Kidambi Srikanth, Priyanshu Rajawat and Kiran George (Doubles) Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, Chirag Shetty, MR Arjun, Dhruv Kapila and Sai Pratheek Uber Cup squad: (Singles) Anmol Kharb, Tanvi Sharma, Ashmita Chaliha and Isharani Baruah (Doubles) Shruti Mishra, Priya Konjengbam, Simran Singhi and Ritika Thaker     "," Hosts China will go all out, Indonesia will be raring to put 2022 behind them and have players hitting some terrific form, Denmark and Japan will fancy their chances too and watch out for Chinese Taipei, who are capable of doing what India did last time.

807,Sports,"Belting sixes from the outset, new-age leftie Abhishek Sharma makes an impact at the top",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/ipl/abhishek-sharma-batting-sixes-sunrisers-hyderabad-powerplay-9292634/,"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/New-Project-2024-04-26T193914.900.jpg?resize=450,253","APRIL 26, 2024","Sunrisers Hyderabad's Abhishek Sharma has hit a six every fifth ball during the IPL, and along with fellow opener Travis Head, he has provided SRH supersonic starts.","Abhishek Sharma has faced just 132 balls in eight innings this IPL season. That is just 16 and a half balls every game. It is not a wow stat. Except when you consider that he has smeared every fifth ball (5.07) over the fence, often landing in the stands. It indeed is a wow stat, because it’s six-hitting frequency that betters the best six-hitters in this business. The most ferocious six-striker of our times, the semi-retired Chris Gayle, smacked one every nine-and-a-half balls he faced in T20s; the Indian maharaja of maximums, Rohit Sharma buried one every 16th ball. Certainly, their careers span almost as long as Abhishek’s age (23). They have traversed the breadth of this world, tamed varied climes and bowlers. Abhishek is in the nascence of his career, yet to feature in one full season of the league, and four short of 100 T20 games. Gayle has played 10 times more than him; Rohit five-fold. Abhishek might or might not scale such lofty peaks. Before that he would have to maintain this season after season, and prove he is not a one-season wonder. Yet, he has become an unputdownable watch this season. In the company of Travis Head, who by the way pummels a six every 8.5 balls, he has teed off Sunrisers Hyderabad to supersonic starts. The pair has, in their daring and relish, dusted up memories of another time and format when Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana ripped new-ball bowlers apart to maximise the 15-over field restrictions in the 1996 ODI World Cup. If Head is the equivalent of Sanath Jayasuriya, Abhishek has been something of a Kaluwitharana, accomplice rather than an understudy.
Then it’s not so much about how many Abhishek hits as it is about how he hits them. He makes it all look like the most natural thing in the world, as though it wouldn’t have occurred to him to play any other way. There are few twiddles and fiddles as he takes strike, always with half a smile, as though he is passing his gentle greetings to the bowler before he subjects them to violence. There are no awkward shuffles or trigger movements, as is often the case with batsmen bred in Delhi and Punjab. Perhaps when you are as gifted as Abhishek at seeing and hitting a cricket ball, everything else is window dressing. He is still at the crease watching the ball with hawkish eyes and waiting for it to reach him. Only when he has processed the ball and the response — the length, line and the most productive stroke — would he commit. The feet then move nimbly, yet firmly. His movements are definite. The heart of his batting is his bat-swing — as it was with his mentor Yuvraj Singh and idol Brian Lara. It descends from a height like a crisp, clinical swish of the sword, generating an eye-twitching bat-speed. The two elements breathe timing and power into his shots. Even the follow-through is smooth and simple. He rarely falls over in the shuddering impact of the ball on bat. Leg-side predilection is evident. As do most six-hitters. As many as 23 of 26 maximums were hits on the leg. Of them, 16 were dispatched between midwicket and long-on. It could misconstrue an impression that he slogs his way to sixes. He does slog, but that’s not his most productive stroke. A lot of them are flick, lofted drives (especially of spinners) and pulls. The leg-side skew could also be because he often targets spinners rather than seamers for big shots (spinners account for 16 of them). He is a ruthless destroyer of spinners, not sparing even the finest of them, Kuldeep Yadav and Rashid Khan. A six off Rashid stands out — he shimmied down the track and lofted his googly over long-off. Kuldeep was carted for three sixes in an over, twice using his feet to reach the pitch of the ball. Against seamers, he resorts to the more conventional drives and uses the horizontal bat only when the ball is short. As his six-scything rages on, whispers of him waltzing into the consciousness of selectors, who would soon pick the squad for the World T20, have gathered girth. Abhishek himself was shocked when the question was put across to him recently. “If start thinking about selection and having a breakthrough IPL season, then my focus might be lost,” he had said. He is not yet ripe to barge into the squad that is well-stocked at the top. But he certainly is a glint in the corner of the selectors’ eyes, one for the future. His talents are rare — a new-age left-handed batsman who could belt sixes from the first ball he faces and bat anywhere in the order. There is a less-utilised skill of his too, bowling. He could bowl orthodox left-arm and possess a seamer’s leg-cutter of sorts. But that skill would only be an add-on, when compared to his incredible six-hitting prowess, the most precious currency in T20 cricket.

Yuvraj, named an ambassador for the tournament to be held in the USA and the West Indies from next month, said: “As you get older people start talking about your age and they forget about your form. “These guys (Rohit and Virat have been great players for India and they deserve to go (retire) when they want,” Yuvraj said. While Yuvraj, winner of the inaugural T20 World Cup, backed Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli for this edition, he insisted the duo must make way for youngsters post the tournament. “I would like to see more younger players in the T20 format, because it gets the load off them (experienced players) playing 50-over (ODIs) and Test matches. “After this (T20) World Cup I would like to see a lot of younger guys come into the team and make the T20 side for the next World Cup,” Yuvraj told ICC. Also Read: No Virat Kohli or Hardik Pandya, so which players did Sanjay Manjrekar pick in his India 15? Yuvraj also backed Shivam Dube, a batter often likened to the 42-year-old in terms of power and ball-striking as a left-hander. Dube has been prolific touch this IPL season with the Chennai Super Kings, carrying his hitting form from 2023. “I would like to see Shivam Dube in the squad. He has been in and out of the (India) team, but this IPL he has been batting very well and he is someone who can be the game-changer. There are a lot of other guys who have been playing for a while now, but I would like to see Shivam Dube in the mix.” In terms of spin-bowling options, Yuvraj also backed veteran leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, India’s leading wicket-taker in the format to bolt into the squad. Chahal, who made his debut in 2016, has yet to feature in a T20 World Cup, having missed out on both the 2021 and 2022 editions of the showpiece event. He also backed young uncapped seamer Harshit Rana, who has excelled with the Kolkata Knight Riders this season. The 22-year-old Delhi bowler has picked up nine wickets from five outings thus far. With the wicket-keepers’ tussle hotting up, Yuvraj said it would be wiser for India to back younger keepers in Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson rather than turning back to Dinesh Karthik who has rekindled his finishing capabilities with the Royal Challengers Bengaluru this IPL season. Karthik started the last T20 World Cup in Australia as India’s designated keeper before losing his spot ahead of the team’s semifinal defeat to England. “DK (Karthik) has been batting well, but the thing with DK is the last time (2022) they picked him and the T20 WC was on he didn’t get to play. If DK is not in your XI I don’t think there is any point in picking him. “There is Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson and both guys are in great form and obviously they are younger,” Yuvraj stated. Yuvraj, best remembered for his iconic six sixes in an over against Stuart Broad in the 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa, backed Suryakumar Yadav to be India’s critical gamechanger in the first 20-team World Cup alongside pace ace Jasprit Bumrah. “Suryakumar Yadav (is India’s key player) because the way he plays, he can change the complexion of a game in 15 balls. I think Jasprit Bumrah is also the key with the bowling and I would like to see a leg-spinner in the squad as well, like Yuzvendra Chahal as he has been bowling really well. “But being a batter, I would say Suryakumar Yadav (is the key player).” India open their campaign on June 5, nine days after the IPL 2024 season, facing Ireland at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. Pakistan, Canada and co-hosts United States complete India’s group.      "," “These guys (Rohit and Virat have been great players for India and they deserve to go (retire) when they want,” Yuvraj said. “I would like to see more younger players in the T20 format, because it gets the load off them (experienced players) playing 50-over (ODIs) and Test matches. “After this (T20) World Cup I would like to see a lot of younger guys come into the team and make the T20 side for the next World Cup,” Yuvraj told ICC.

Sam Curran won the toss and put Shreyas Iyer's side into bat first","Kolkata Knight Riders vs Punjab Kings IPL 2024 highlights: Jonny Bairstow’s 100 ensured Punjab Kings would create history at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Friday by chasing the highest total ever by an IPL side in the history of competition against the Kolkata Knight Riders. Alongside Bairstow, Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh chipped in with valuable contributions to make the improbable possible. Apart from Sunil Narine, it has been a sorry-looking bowling card yet again for KKR. KKR is currently second in the 10-team table with 10 points, four behind table toppers Rajasthan Royals (14 points) and the team’s success is largely due to the batting efforts from the top-order. Follow live score and updates of KKR vs PBKS from Kolkata below.  Very pleasing. Most importantly the win. Cricket is turning into baseball. We have had a few tough weeks. But we hung in there. The way guys train. The confidence and the coaches. The small grounds and the dew. The reviews which might give you an extra ball. We hung in there and managed to chase it down with balls to spare. Pleased for Johnny. What an amazing knock. Shashank Singh has been the find of the tournament for us. Ashutosh as well. Proud of everyone. “Save the bowlers” someone plsss
??? #KKRvsPBKS #IPL2024 Sandip G: Smuggling a single, Shashank Singh leapt and punched the air. His partner and chief architect of the chase, Jonny Bairstow soon embraced. In a trice, ecstatic teammates piled on in cathartic joy. It  has been a difficult season for Punjab Kings, having lost six of their eight encounters before this. But here they pulled the highest run chase ever in this format, with eight balls to spare no less. The Eden Gardens crowd stood and stared shocked, wanting to celebrate the moment yet mourn their team’s defeat. They recovered from the initial jolt and gamely applauded Punjab Kings. A gutted Shreyas Iyer, the KKR captain, would tell the hosts broadcasters: “Both teams played tremendously. You have to go back to the drawing board and see where you went wrong. Not defending hurts but it's a great lesson for the players.” Shashank, who leathered 68 off 28 balls, choked for words as he explained his methods. It was just another league game, but the mood was akin to a big knockout match that had just gotten over. Then every day, teams don’t chase down 262 in this format. It’s a night to celebrate the game as much as the record chase. It is ironical the match ended as after all the carnage of boundaries it was a quick single that gave Punjab Kings this historic win. Jonny Bairstow has been the anchor of the chase for lack of better words the likes of Prabhsimran and Shashank in the end did their cameo bit. As per KKR bowlers, there is a lot of work to be done with regards to their bowling.  Nine runs are needed from two overs in a normal game it would have looked fine but given the context of the chase, this is remarkable for Punjab. It will take some time to sync in for both sides but KKR need to sort out their bowling going forward in the torunament. Chameera has been brought back into the attack Shashank smacked him for three mammoth sixes to extract 18 runs. Punjab needs 18 more to win to make the highest chased total ever in the history of the tournament. What a game we are having. Bairstow gets to his 100 in just 45 balls what a knock he single handi did the damage in the middle overs and made sure the rate has been under check through and the way things are going this might not even need 20 overs for Punjab to get it done. The Indian Premier League (IPL) season has witnessed several high-scoring chases throughout 17 editions. Rajasthan Royals recorded the highest successful run-chase in IPL history during the 2020 IPL season where they overhauled a 224-run target against the Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) in Sharjah. They equalled the record in the 2024 season, with a sensational chase against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens. RR chased down 224 off the final delivery, led by an unbeaten hundred from Jos Buttler. (Read more) Narine has been brought back into the attack and the matchwinner again delivers the goods for KKR. Shashank has walked into the middle and he has a job to do here. This is a good time for KKR to bowl a few tight overs.  That is another expense over some brutal hitting from Bairstow against Russell. 24 runs came off that last over this is now getting bad to worse for the Kolkata Knight Riders here as well. The way things are going this could be over way before 20 overs.  This is turning into carnage here in Eden Gardens yes the ball is gripping but the brute strength with which the batters are clearing their front leg and hitting the balls into the stands has been remarkable. Off all the days it Bairstow has hit some form when Punjab needed the most.  Vinayakk: Prabhsimran Singh had developed an unfortunate habit. Frequently used as the Impact Player by Punjab Kings, he almost always comes out to bat, goes bang-bang, then gets out in the 20s and 30s. Of the 8 innings before Friday night in Kolkata, Prabhsimran crossed 19 five times but didn't cross 35. At Eden Gardens though, he seemed to put it right in some style. He took Punjab to a blistering start, smashing Harshit Rana, Dushmantha Chameera, Anukul Roy in the powerplay. Then came Sunil Narine, and Prabhsimran welcomed him with a four and six. The 20-ball 54 was a brilliant knock... but it came to an end with a run out at the end of 24-run over. Jonny Bairstow smashed Anukul Roy 4-6-4-4-6 but off the last ball, took off for a single that saw Prabhsimran fall short thanks to a Narine direct hit. As he walked off, he put the bat face close to his helmet grille and roared in frustration. A soft end after a stunning start. Bairstow smacked a six-through long off to bring up his 50 off just 23 balls. That is his first half-century since he came to India in January. His innings are here keeping Punjab Kings in the chase. This is promising to be another close contest. Harshit Rana has been brought back into the attack by Kolkata after a cluster of overs from spin and he bowled a decent over without picking a wicket. Punjab can afford that slowing down of rate because of the hyperaggressive start given by Prabhsimran Singh. After the expensive over from Anukul Roy it has been a good back from Narine just giving away one run in that over after the strategic time out. Here lies the challenge for Punjab batters. They need to deal with Kolkata mystery spinners.  Off the final ball of the powerplay, Prabhsimran got himself runout trying to sneak a quick single. It has also been a dream powerplay for Punjab as they scored their highest in the phase when it was needed the most.  Narine came into the attack and Prabhsimran slog-swept him for a six and brought up his fifty this has been an excellent start from Punjab Kings in this run chase but the challenge is they need to keep the momentum going even after field is spread.  Spin has been introduced by KKR Anukul Roy has been brought into the attack and Prabhsimran played a couple of ugly shots to get boundaries away. However, the wicket seems to be still gripping a bit for spinners.  Prabhsimran has got Punjab to a terrific start here. He is pummeling the bowlers all around the dial. It will be interesting to see if Iyer will turn to spinner as seamers are getting nothing out of this surface at the moment.  Harshit Rana took the new ball from the other end however, missed his mark a couple of times and Prabhsimran punished him with boundaries. They need plenty of these in this powerplay so that they can stay in touch with the target.  Dushmantha Chameera is the new face of KKR and he has taken the new ball and started well. There is not much of a swing on offer however, he did hit the top of the off stump in that first over.  287/3 - SRH vs RCB, Bengaluru, 2024

Punjab needs dew to set in even if they need to have any outside chance in this game as the wicket continues to get slower we will be right back for the 2nd innings action. Sandip G: Amidst Shreyas Iyer’s carnage of Sam Curran—6,4, 6, 6—one stroke stood out for its impossible trajectory. The second six, a flick that was both brutal and beautiful. Iyer had premeditated and moved across, assuming that Curran would spear a wide yorker. But he bowled full on middle and leg stump. So Iyer had to readjust. He did so by keeping his front-leg upright, his back knee bent a touch, careful that it did not slide further away, which could have obstructed the path of the bat. It was an awkward pose, but he kept his poise, and let those malleable wrists twist and close and take the ball to the stands over deep midwicket, all the while standing tall and not bending forward as most batsmen naturally do when flicking, Watch out for the snapping wrists, that imparts direction onto the ball. Iyer loved the shot, as he watched it’s stand-ward ascent. Vinayakk: In an otherwise all-out attacking approach KKR have adopted for this season, Shreyas Iyer has been going slow in the middle order. After starting the season with a 24-ball 39, Shreyas either played short cameos or dropped anchor. There was a 32-ball 34, a 38-ball 38 and a 36-ball 50 thrown into the mix. So it was a little bit of a surprise that he came out to bat in the 16h over when DreRuss got out. The first thought was it would have been the ideal entry point for finisher Rinku Singh. But after struggling with the short balls early on, Shreyas went out all guns blazing this time around. He smashed a 10-ball 28, with intent to go big without taking his time to settle in. Sure, the match situation helped but still, it was a welcome display of aggression from the KKR captain that hasn't been seen too frequently this year. Arshdeep picked up Shreyas Iyer and finished off his spell with a 10-run over. 9 run over. It has been a brilliant spell from the left-armer under the circumstances. Rinku has walked into the middle for the final couple of overs.  Vinayakk: Punjab Kings needed to break the KKR opening partnership early. Phil Salt and Sunil Narine have been key to Kolkata's fast starts eventually ending up in big totals but with their all-out attacking approach, there is also the downside of giving opportunities for the opponents. Punjab actually did well to create these chances. But unfortunately, they came to Eden Gardens with butter fingers. Narine was dropped by Harpreet Brar as early as the third over. Then Salt was put down twice, one an absolute sitter by Sam Curran. The openers went on to add 138 for the first wicket. Then Andre Rusell was given a life too. A smart field placement saw Arshdeep bowl with a fine fly slip but the outside edge that was heading straight into the hands, but gloved away by a diving Jitesh Sharma. Fortunately, this time around, DreRuss was out the next ball as Arshdeep bowled a bouncer. Harshal did take the catch this time. Well, Curran brought himself back into the attack missed his yorkers Iyer stood there and delivered the ball into the stands courtesy of his flexible rubber-like wrists. All the momentum that has been pulled back was regained in that over.  Another decent over in the context of the game from Rabada. After the rampage once the openers fell things have quieted down here. If Punjab can restrict KKR under 250 with the foreign batting options they have at their disposal they might have an outside chance. Arshdeep Singh is brought into the attack and he bounces out Andre Russell. After bowling an expensive first over this has been a good spell from the left-armer. However, still, four overs are remaining and Punjab would be hoping dew to fall in the second innings to help their cause. Sandip G: Sam Curran has developed so many slower-ball variations that he rarely nudged 130kph, let alone 140 which once he regularly clocked. But for once, he was forced to rev up his pace and was indeed rewarded. Phil Salt had clouted him for a pair of flat sixes, both off slower balls. The first one hovered around the 115kph mark, the second even slower at 109 kph. Salt would judge the length and just swing through the line. Curran had already conceded 30 runs in 14 balls and he wanted a shot at redemption. He reverted to his biggest strength, that is to bowl a yorker at full-pelt. The ball only measured 131 clicks on the speedo, but it was pinpoint accurate. The ball drifted in a tad from his wrists, and upon landing, block-hole or thereabouts straightened to blast the off-stump. The batsman was beaten chiefly for pace. Perhaps this is his new trick—reverse the routine. Batsmen are expecting him to take the pace off the ball. So slip one faster, and beat them for pace. It worked. Rahul Chahar has been brought back into the attack after the strategic timeout. He is done for the day and given the way things have unfolded tonight it has been a very good spell from Chahar. With six overs remaining it will be interesting to see how much can KKR get here. Sam Curran has brought himself into the attack and he picks Phil Salt with a brilliant yorker. Both the openers are now back in the hut but there is no respite for Punjab batters as Andre Russell has walked into the middle now.  Finally, Brar has been brought into the attack and he delivered a decent over. The over did not go for a boundary and remained under double digits. Punjab have shot themselves in the foot by not using the left-arm spinner till now as if he has to complete his spell it would go into the death overs of the game. That over is what Punjab needed. Rahul Chahar provides the breakthrough. The wicket is gripping and it is hard to understand why Curran has not even given one over to Brar despite pacers have been taken for cleaners.  10 overs into the game Kolkata are threatening to break SRH's record of highest total here. How will Punjab stop that is impossible to know. They have not taken the opportunities given and their bowling is below par. As we update Narine departs. Salt cuts one through point to get past his 50 of the night. Both openers have made 50. Punjab did take a review against Narina for an LBW which did not go their way. Nothing is working out for Punjab they have been in and out of all the games they have played this is the first time they are looking completely out of their depth.  Another big big over from Rabada and in the due course Narine has gone past fifty as well. This is turning into a nightmare evening for Punjab with batting order which is struggling whatever the score it is from here on it will take a lot for PBKS to get there. Rahul Chahar was brought into the attack and Phil Salt gave another opportunity to backwards point Rabada and he spilt it again. It is the third drop chance of the evening. The partnership is already flying for KKR and these drops are helping their cause as well. Arshdeep bowled a decent final over off the powerplay however, the disappointing part of that over was been Salt gave a catch which Curran standing at mid-off dropped.  This is getting bad to ugly for PBKS 30 minutes into the game already. This is a blistering start for KKR yet again. Punjab who has been playing low-scoring games at Mullanpur for the last five games need to adapt to the conditions quickly here. More importantly, they need to get a breakthrough as the batters just keep coming in this KKR line up one after the other.  Rabada was given the ball however, Sunil Narine was in no mood to show any respect to Punjab's ace bowler and he climbed onto him. Four overs into the game KKR have reached 59. It will be interesting to see how Punjab reacts from here on. Surprising tactic from Curran to throw the ball in the powerplay to Harshal Patel who got a bit of pasting from Phil Salt. This is another rollicking start for KKR. PBKS need to quickly get in a bowler who can pick a wicket aka Kagiso Rabada Arshdeep Singh has taken the new ball from the other end and it has been an expensive over from the left-armer. Must say his form in the tournament continues to spiral down as each game is passing by. Narine on the other hand has got himself a start. We are done with the first over Sam Curran has taken the new ball and instead of looking to swing the ball up front he used a few slower ones to get the better of Sunil Narine who was up to the task as he smacked the bowler over covers for a boundary.  The pitch is looking good for batting the last couple of games we had at this venue have been on the higher-scoring side and the atmosphere here is promising to be the same today. The openers are walking out into the middle and the ground is buzzing as it always does. Total matches played: 32,  Kolkata Knight Riders won: 21,  Punjab Kings won: 11 Coming back (into the IPL), obviously to a different team. Getting to know about the youngsters in this KKR set-up, I have played against a few, but I've seen a lot of talent in this franchise, sharing my thoughts and answering their questions, it's been enjoyable. We know that the grounds in India are smaller when compared to back at home (in Australia), the wickets are generally pretty good throughout the game, the impact player rule as well. The batters are coming in with an intention to throw their bats around. You can see that impact in the Sunrisers with Heady at the top, just going out and trying to clear the infield. It's been a challenge to come here and play in the best T20 league in the world. The wickets have played differently in the day games and the night games - it does become easier to bat under the lights, it has been a learning curve. Playing in the heat is a part of the game, fortunately it's only 20 overs in the field and you can deal with it. Things have been going well so far (for KKR), different individuals have stood up, the next two home games are very important for us before we travel. So the two points today could be very important in that regard. Punjab Kings Impact Subs: Prabhsimran Singh, Rishi Dhawan, Vidhwath Kaverappa, Shivam Singh, Prince Choudhary Kolkata Knight Riders Subs: Suyash Sharma, Anukul Roy, Manish Pandey, Vaibhav Arora, Rahmanullah Gurbaz Philip Salt(w), Sunil Narine, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Shreyas Iyer(c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Dushmantha Chameera, Varun Chakaravarthy, Harshit Rana Jonny Bairstow, Sam Curran(c), Rilee Rossouw, Jitesh Sharma(w), Shashank Singh, Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh We've had different players stepping up at different times, that's the thing I'm pleased about this season. Starcy got a cut on his finger in the last game, Dushmantha Chameera replaces him. Need a great start and then convert it into a big score, hoping to continue the same form and momentum. We will have a bowl. We had 4 games at home, unfortunately lost all four, guys are ready for the away games though. We know what we need to do from here, just go out and play. Liam Livingstone misses out, Jonny Bairstow is back. In Punjab Kings, they meet a side that has been inconsistent and despite two good finds in Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma, they haven’t exactly done well during key moments and like every other year, they are all but out of play-off contention. The experience has been very good, I'm enjoying right now and hopefully it'll stay the same during the rest of the season. Our only thought is to to have the right process (on his batting partnership with Shashank Singh), if we do that we'll definitely start winning. Not thinking about it., my job is only about batting and batting well for the team. I can't talk about the top-order failures, but I can assure that we'll do well tonight. It's absolutely scorching at mid-forty degrees which will make it slightly uncomfortable for the players. 66m and 63m square boundaries while the straight boundary is at 73m. This is going to play as it has right through the season, it has plenty of pace and bounce on offer, the pitch itself is rock hard, the silt content on this surface is around 70% or more, in general it's around 50-60%. There are a lot of patches on a good length area on both ends, the grass is abrasive and the spinners could get some help, especially in the first innings. KKR's spinners should have an advantage as they rely on pace and lateral movement. It's a high scoring venue, there's now dew, the curators have confirmed the same. The captain winning the tos could still opt to chase first In the heyday of fearsome Caribbean pace packs, Andy Roberts, the patron saint of fast bowlers, was asked if he would ever resort to a slower ball. He replied, in a condescending tone, the story goes: “The quicker one is the bouncer that hit him on the helmet because he played it too late; the slower one is the bouncer that struck him on the helmet because he played too early.” None of his compatriots or the fast bowling fraternity elsewhere, like Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thompson, felt the need to reduce pace to deceive batsmen. Times have changed. The slower ball is as powerful a weapon, across formats, as the toe-crusher or rib-tickler. Even more so in T20s, where not possessing a lethal slower ball is akin to a doctor without a super-specialization degree these days. Even the quickest and deadliest have it. Jasprit Bumrah and Pat Cummins; Shaheen Shah Afridi and Kagiso Rabada. Those that haven’t fine-tuned one find themselves swept aside in this format, even if they own several other gifts. As is the plight of Mitchell Starc, the most expensive fetch in IPL. Total matches played: 12,  Kolkata Knight Riders won: 9,  Punjab Kings won: 3 ""We need to stick to our routines and processes and see to it that we execute the things we want."" - Shreyas Iyer wants KKR to keep doing the basics right ""Now we know what to do, we have to win every game."" - Sam Curran knows his team's task ahead is simple yet complicated  Is the absence of the slower ball robbing Mitchell Starc off another dimension and making him predictable? A lack of a well-crafted slower-ball has compounded Starc's struggles, rendering him one-dimensional, neutering his death-over prowess. (BCCI) Mitchell Starc is an irresistible concoction of gifts–the in-swinging yorker, the head-winking bouncer, the untameable hard length balls, pace and control, strength and stamina; in short everything a fast bowler would crave for, enough to coax ₹24.75 crore from KKR’s pockets–except that he doesn’t possess a high-definition slower ball.

Alongside Bairstow, Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh chipped in with valuable contributions to make the improbable possible. Apart from Sunil Narine, it has been a sorry-looking bowling card yet again for KKR. KKR is currently second in the 10-team table with 10 points, four behind table toppers Rajasthan Royals (14 points) and the team’s success is largely due to the batting efforts from the top-order. #KKRvsPBKS #IPL2024 Sandip G: Smuggling a single, Shashank Singh leapt and punched the air. His partner and chief architect of the chase, Jonny Bairstow soon embraced."
