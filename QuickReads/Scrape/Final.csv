900,Business,Rooting for Trump to fail has made his stock shorters millions,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/world-market/rooting-for-trump-to-fail-has-made-his-stock-shorters-millions-9292812/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/Donald-Trump-5.jpg?w=450,"APRIL 26, 2024","As of Friday morning, a month since Trump Media's initial public offering sent its stock to USD 66.22, it has plunged to USD 38.49.","Rooting for Donald Trump to fail has rarely been this profitable. Just ask a hardy band of mostly amateur Wall Street investors who have collectively made tens of millions of dollars over the past month by betting that the stock price of his social media business — Truth Social — will keep dropping despite massive buying by Trump loyalists and wild swings that often mirror the candidate’s latest polls, court trials and outbursts on Truth Social itself. Several of these investors interviewed by The Associated Press say their bearish gambles using “put” options and other trading tools are driven less by their personal feelings about the former president (most don’t like him) than their faith in the woeful underlying financials of a company that made less money last year than the average Wendy’s hamburger franchise. “This company makes no money. … It makes no sense,” said Boise, Idaho, ad executive Elle Stange, who estimates she’s made USD 1,300 betting against Trump Media and Technology stock. “He’s not as great a businessman as he thinks. A lot of his businesses go belly up, quickly.” Says Seattle IT security specialist Jeff Cheung, “This is guaranteed to go to zero.” As of Friday morning, a month since Trump Media’s initial public offering sent its stock to USD 66.22, it has plunged to USD 38.49. An AP analysis of data from research firms FactSet and S3 Partners shows that investors using puts and “short selling” have paper profits so far of at least USD 200 million, not including the costs of puts, which vary from trade to trade. Still, amateur traders, mostly risking no more than a few thousand dollars each, say the stock is too volatile to declare victory yet. So they are cashing in a bit now, letting other bets ride and stealing a glance at the latest stock movements in the office cubicle, at the kitchen table or even on the toilet. There have been plenty of scary moments, including last week when DJT, the ex-president’s initials and stock ticker, jumped nearly 40 per cent in two days. “I don’t know which direction the stock is going,” says Schenectady, NY, day trader Richard Persaud while checking his iPhone amid the surge. “It’s so unbelievably overvalued.” Many who spoke to the AP say knowing their bets have helped slash the value of Trump’s 65 per cent stake in half is an added political benefit. If some of their predictions are right, they may able to someday push it to zero, making it impossible for him to tap it to pay his hefty legal bills or finance his GOP presidential campaign. They have a long way to go. Trump’s stake is still worth USD 4 billion. Normally, investors betting a stock will fall, especially a gutsy breed of hedge fund traders called “short sellers,” will do plenty of homework. They’ll pore over financial statements, develop expertise in an industry, talk to competitors, and even turn to “forensic accountants” to find hidden weaknesses in the books.
No need in Trump Media’s case. It’s all there in the Sarasota, Florida-based company’s 100-page financial report: A firehose of losses, USD 58 million last year, on minuscule revenue of USD 4 million from advertising and other sources. The losses are so big, as Trump Media’s auditor wrote in the report, they “raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.” A short seller’s dream? Or is it a nightmare? Amateur trader Manny Marotta has two computer screens at home, one for work, the other showing DJT stock’s movements where he can gauge how much he’s up or down. It wasn’t looking so good earlier this week. The legal writer from suburban Cleveland had been up about USD 4,000 on “put” options purchased over the past few weeks. But the screen that morning was showing investors, presumably rich ones, buying large volumes of DJT shares, pushing up the stock once again. “My options are worth less with every passing minute,” says Marotta, adding about DJT: “It’s being manipulated. It’s insane.” Waiting for the stock to drop is especially painful to “short sellers,” who pay a fee to borrow shares owned by others. The idea is to quickly sell them on a hunch they will be able to buy the same number of them later for much cheaper before having to return them to the lender. That allows short sellers to pocket the difference, minus the fee, which is usually nominal. In DJT’s case, the fee is anything but nominal. It was costing 565 per cent a year at one point earlier this month, meaning short sellers had only two months before any possible profits would be eaten up in fees, even if the stock went to zero. It’s a rate so off the charts, that only three other stocks in recent memory have exceeded it, according to data from Boston University’s Karl Diether and Wharton’s Itamar Drechsler, who have studied short selling back two decades. Add in massive buying by Trump supporters who see it as a way to support their candidate, and losses could multiply fast. “It’s scary,” says Drechsler, who likens buyers of Trump’s stock to unwavering sports fans. “It is everything that you hope that the stock market is not.” Trump Media spokeswoman Shannon Devine said the company is in a “strong financial position” with USD 200 million in cash and no debt, and said the AP was “selecting admitted Trump antagonists.” Another danger to the stock is a “short squeeze.” If the price rises sharply, it could set off a rush by short sellers who fear they’ve bet wrongly to return their borrowed shares right away and limit their losses. And so they start buying shares to replace the ones they borrowed and sold, and that very buying tends to work against them, sending the price higher, which in turn scares other short sellers, who then also buy, setting off a vicious cycle of price hikes. “If DJT starts rallying, you’re going to see the mother of all squeezes,” says S3 Partners short-selling expert Ihor Dusaniwsky, who spent three decades at Morgan Stanley helping investors borrow shares. “This is not for the faint of heart.” And if that wasn’t enough, there is a final oddball feature of DJT stock that could trigger an explosion in prices, up or down. “Lock up” agreements prohibit Trump and other DJT executives from selling their shares until September. That leaves the float, or the number of shares that can be traded each day by others, at a dangerously tiny 29 per cent of total shares that will someday flood the market. That means a big purchase or sale on any day that would barely move a typical stock can send DJT flying or crashing. The float is smaller than that of most other notoriously volatile stocks. At their smallest levels, AMC, GameStop and Shake Shack each had more than double the float.
Seattle trader Cheung sees DJT’s freak characteristics as a reason to bet against the stock, not shy away. When the lock-up period ends, he predicts, the ex-president will indeed sell his shares, spooking the market and sending the price down sharply. And even if he doesn’t, other insiders whose lock-ups expire will fear he will do so and will move fast to get a good price before it falls. “The first one to sell out is going make to most, ” Cheung says. “Everyone is going to sell.” Still, he doesn’t want to lose money in the interim, so Cheung is offsetting some of his “put” bets with the purchase of “calls.” The latter are also derivatives, but they do the opposite, paying off when the stock rises. Cheung hopes that whichever makes money, the puts or the calls, he will make enough with one to more than make up for the loss of the other. If all of this seems too complicated, there is a far simpler way to make money betting against Trump. Offshore, casino-style betting sites are taking wagers on the 2024 election, and some have even made President Joe Biden the favorite.

The high court said the process shall be done in not later than five working days. Justice Tara Vitasta Ganju also restrained the resolution professional (RP) appointed under the insolvency law to manage the airline, and its directors from moving or taking away the planes or spare parts, documents, records and any other material. “DGCA shall forthwith and not later than five working days process the deregistration applications filed by the 54 aircrafts,” the court said. The high court said the DGCA, AAI and its authorised representatives shall aid and assist the petitioner lessors and grant them access to the airports. It said the lessors are permitted to export the aircraft as per the applicable rules and laws.
“DGCA shall facilitate export of aircraft by providing export certificates and all other documents,” it said.
The high court pronounced the judgement on petitions by several lessors seeking de-registration of their planes by aviation regulator DGCA so that they could take them back from the airline. After pronouncement of the verdict, the counsel for some of the respondents urged the court to keep its directions in abeyance for a week. However, the judge refused to do so and said “you find another court to put my directions in abeyance”.
Several aircraft lessors of Go First had earlier approached the single judge seeking deregistration of their planes by aviation regulator DGCA so that they could take them back from the airline. Earlier, the NCLT-appointed resolution professional, tasked with managing Go First, had told the high court that returning aircraft to the lessors will render the airline, which has 7,000 employees to look after “dead”. On May 10, 2023, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had admitted the airline’s voluntary insolvency resolution petition and appointed an interim resolution professional to manage the carrier. With a moratorium in force on financial obligations and transfer of assets of Go First in the wake of the insolvency resolution proceedings, the lessors were unable to deregister and take back the aircraft leased to the carrier. The lessors had earlier told the court that denial of deregistration by the DGCA was “illegitimate”.
Some of the lessors who have approached the high court are: Accipiter Investments Aircraft 2 Limited, EOS Aviation 12 (Ireland) Limited, Pembroke Aircraft Leasing 11 Limited, SMBC Aviation Capital Limited, SFV Aircraft Holdings IRE 9 DAC Ltd, ACG Aircraft Leasing Ireland Ltd and DAE SY 22 13 Ireland Designated Activity Company.

In its India’s economic outlook report, Deloitte said the rapid growth of the middle-income class has led to rising purchasing power and even created demand for premium luxury products and services. With the expectation that the number of middle-to-high-income segments will be one in two households by 2030/31, up from one in four currently, we believe this trend will likely become further amplified, driving overall private consumer expenditure growth, it said. Deloitte has revised India’s economic growth prediction for last fiscal to a range of 7.6 to 7.8 per cent. In January, the firm had projected growth for 2023-24 fiscal in the range of 6.9-7.2 per cent. The country’s GDP growth is estimated to reach around 6.6 per cent in FY 2024-25 and 6.75 per cent in the year after, as markets learn to factor in geopolitical uncertainties in their investment and consumption decisions, Deloitte said in its quarterly update to its economic outlook. “The global economy is expected to witness a synchronous rebound in 2025 as major election uncertainties get sorted out and the central banks of the West may announce a couple of rate cuts later in 2024. India will likely see improved capital flows and a rebound in exports” said Deloitte India Economist Rumki Majumdar. Strong growth numbers over the past two years have helped the economy to catch up with the pre-COVID trends. Investment, backed by strong government spending on infrastructure, has helped India maintain a steady recovery momentum, she added. That said, there are concerns about inflation and geopolitical uncertainties feeding into higher food and fuel prices. At the same time, the prediction of above normal monsoon will likely provide some respite by positively impacting agriculture output and easing pressure on food prices. Inflation is expected to remain above the Reserve Bank of India’s target level of 4 per cent over the forecast period due to strong economic activity, Majumdar said. Deloitte’s FY25 GDP growth estimate is similar to the projections made by the World Bank. It is, however, lower than the projections by the RBI and other agencies. The RBI has projected the Indian economy growth at 7 per cent in the current fiscal. While the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Fitch Ratings have estimated growth at 7 per cent, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), S&P Global Ratings and Morgan Stanley projected a 6.8 per cent growth rate for FY25. Deloitte said even as growth in consumer spending post-pandemic has been fluctuating, there is a visible shift in consumption patterns, with demand for luxury and high-end products and services growing faster than demand for basic goods. “India is seeing a prominent shift in consumer behaviour toward aspirational spending, which is inevitable in any nation that experiences growing economic prosperity. India’s spending share in the luxury and premium goods and services category (such as spending on transport, communication, recreation, etc.) has traditionally been lower than nations such as the United States, China, Japan, and Germany. So, there is, therefore, potential for this ratio to increase further as consumer income grows.” Majumdar said. The report further said that to sustainably boost household spending amidst wealth concentration, declining savings, and rising debt levels, several corrective measures can be implemented. Increasing employment opportunities in rural and semi-urban areas could elevate savings, particularly as employment transitions from agriculture, which represents 44 per cent of employment but only about 18 per cent of GDP, to sectors like manufacturing, services, and construction. Government investments in infrastructure and initiatives such as Future Skills Prime 2021 for skill enhancement and Ayushman Bharat for health improvements are expected to enhance employability and productivity. Despite the necessity for credit growth to stimulate economic activity, the RBI will have to monitor rising household debt and encourage banks to leverage data analytics for smarter lending decisions, Deloitte said.        "," Deloitte India on Friday said it estimates India’s GDP growth at 6.6 per cent in the current fiscal helped by consumption expenditure, exports rebound and capital flows. In its India’s economic outlook report, Deloitte said the rapid growth of the middle-income class has led to rising purchasing power and even created demand for premium luxury products and services. The country’s GDP growth is estimated to reach around 6.6 per cent in FY 2024-25 and 6.75 per cent in the year after, as markets learn to factor in geopolitical uncertainties in their investment and consumption decisions, Deloitte said in its quarterly update to its economic outlook. Inflation is expected to remain above the Reserve Bank of India’s target level of 4 per cent over the forecast period due to strong economic activity, Majumdar said."

Doctors can now prescribe the drug, called Pivya (pivmecillinam), to female adults with uncomplicated UTIs. Clinical trials show that Pivya is effective and side effects are limited. As antibiotic resistance continues to increase, Pivya’s addition to available treatments is welcome. Clinical cure: Symptoms of the uncomplicated UTI are gone and no new symptoms appear. Microbiological response: Levels of bacteria in the urine are reduced. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common reasons for visits to general practitioners. During their lifetimes, almost 1 in 2 females will experience a UTI, accounting for around 25%
of all infections in females. Treatment for a UTI may vary and often require antibiotics. Now, for the first time in 20 years in the United States, the FDA has approved
a new oral antibiotic to treat uncomplicated UTIs. The drug, pivmecillinam, marketed as Pivya, is a synthetic version of penicillin. Experts describe UTIs as “uncomplicated” when the urinary tract is otherwise healthy, and there are no ongoing chronic conditions, immune issues, recent urologic surgery, or pregnancy. Treating UTIs with Pivya may be new in the U.S., but doctors in Canada and some European countries have been prescribing the drug for UTIs for the past 40 years. In fact, the first studies demonstrating Pivya’s effectiveness against uncomplicated UTIs were published in the 1970s
. Pivya is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, meaning it kills only a small number of bacterial species. For this reason, Pivya is only approved for use in UTIs caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. The drug is owned by Utility Therapeutics, a company that focuses on treatments for UTIs. The FDA’s April 24 approval of Pivya was based on the results of three clinical trials: This study involved 271 participants. Of those who received Pivya, 62% achieved the composite response compared with 10% in the placebo group. For this study, scientists recruited 259 people. In total, 72% of those taking Pivya achieved a composite response, compared with 76% of those taking the other antimicrobial. In this study, involving 224 people, 66% of those taking Pivya achieved composite response compared with 22% of those taking ibuprofen. The most important measure in these studies was the “composite response rate,” which combines two important outcomes: The composite response rate means symptoms have subsided and the bacteria are gone. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that Pivya worked better than placebo and ibuprofen and similarly to other available antibiotics. Side effects were also relatively minor. Most commonly, they included nausea and diarrhea. Healthline asked Niels Frimodt-Møller, a professor in the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Rigshospitalet in Denmark and expert on UTIs, about the possible side effects of the new FDA-approved drug. “All drugs have adverse effects, but this has relatively few. However, it does produce the same allergic reactions as other penicillins,” he said. The FDA explains that certain people should avoid using Pivya, including those with “carnitine deficiency resulting from inherited disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and carnitine metabolism.” Also, people living with porphyria should avoid the drug. Healthline spoke with Bjørn Åsheim Hansen, MD from Vestfold Hospital Trust in Denmark, who has published papers on pivmecillinam
. “Of course, there are side-effects like nausea and rash as with every other drug. But Pivya is well tolerated,” Hansen said. As the FDA mentioned, Hansen noted “there have been some concerns” about carnitine deficiency
, which may cause serious symptoms. However, Hansen believes this has “insignificant clinical consequences,” and is currently writing a paper on the topic. The prevalence of UTIs is on the rise
, especially in higher-income countries, like the U.S. UTIs are an unpleasant and painful experience for younger people. In older adults, who are more susceptible
to them, UTIs can be even more serious, leading to hospitalization. In some cases, UTIs in older adults can be fatal. While antibiotic treatment for UTIs is generally effective, a growing number of bacteria have developed ways to protect themselves against antibiotics, making them less effective. This is known as antibiotic resistance, and it is a serious and growing public health concern. A global surveillance report from the World Health Organization, (WHO)
found that around 20% of E. coli in urine samples — the most common cause of UTIs — were resistant to first- and second-line antibiotics. That’s around 1 in 5 UTI cases, according to the report. Thomas Lodise, PharmD, PhD, a professor at Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences and a clinical pharmacist at the Stratton VA Medical Center in Albany, New York, told Healthline that resistance to “two of the most widely used oral antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs has been reported to exceed 20% in most regions of the U.S.” This is why discovering new drugs or, as in this case, revisiting overlooked antibiotics, is an important area of research. Having a new antibiotic to treat UTIs is a positive step forward, but it does not completely remove the issue of antibiotic resistance, a growing problem worldwide. Møller explained that, while Pivya is a “great antibiotic for uncomplicated UTIs, if it’s used too broadly, it will generate resistance as do all other antibiotics.” However, Hansen noted they “have used the drug for decades in Scandinavia and still resistance is not a problem.” Antibiotic resistance related to Pivya is still at low levels — around 5%. According to some experts, this may be because Pivya does not interfere with bacteria living in the gut. Hansen cited growing evidence that Pivya might also be effective against antibiotic-resistant E.coli, which could have future implications for how this drug is prescribed. The FDA has approved the first new antibiotic to treat uncomplicated UTIs in two decades. The move will help health professionals navigate the growing issue of antibiotic resistance and bring relief to many people who experience this condition."," Doctors can now prescribe the drug, called Pivya (pivmecillinam), to female adults with uncomplicated UTIs.

They note that cholesterol-lowering medications are used more frequently immediately after a diagnosis and decline over the next three years, with the decline more pronounced in women. Women develop heart disease less often than men but have a higher rate of death from it. Less than 60 60 to 69 70 to 79 80 and older Men with heart disease are treated for high cholesterol more often than women with heart disease, according to research presented at the ESC Preventive Cardiology 2024, a scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology. In their study, which hasn’t been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal, the scientists from Sweden examined electronic health records of 1,452 people (1,037 men and 415 women) with a chronic cardiac syndrome diagnosed between 2012 and 2020. The subjects had a mean age of 68 for men and 70 for women. None of the participants had previously had a heart attack. The researchers looked at data on cholesterol levels and dispensed medication from the Swedish National Prescribed Drug Registry. Participants were followed up for three years following their diagnosis. At the end of the third year, 54% of women had been treated with cholesterol-lowering medications compared with 74% of men. Five percent of women were treated with statins compared to 8% of men. The researchers also examined cholesterol levels in individuals diagnosed with coronary syndrome and treatments in different age groups: The scientists reported that prescriptions of cholesterol-lowering treatment (statins) were highest immediately following diagnosis and declined over the next three years in all age groups. The decline was more pronounced in women compared to men. The study authors reported that for people younger than 60, 65% of women and 79% of men received cholesterol-lowering medication after diagnosis. Three years later, 52% of women and 78% of men continued to receive this treatment. Reaching and maintaining target LDL cholesterol levels was lower in women than in men. “Data has shown that providers did not offer statins as often as men,” said Dr. Laxmi Mehta, a cardiologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center who was not involved in the study. “One barrier has been the complexity of prescribing medications during the childbearing years,” Mehta explained to Healthline. “When recommended statin therapy, women were more likely
to decline it and more likely to discontinue it after starting treatment. Women have less belief in the safety and effectiveness of statins in preventing heart disease.” The disparity isn’t just when treating cholesterol issues. According to an article
in the International Journal for Equity in Health, gender disparity in healthcare is embedded in the health system. The authors noted that over a 21-year period, women were diagnosed later than men for more than 700 different diseases. “The study highlights an unfortunate inequity in our health system that has led to the under-treatment of women with heart disease,” said Dr. Sameer Amin, the chief medical officer of the LA Care Health Plan in California who was not involved in the study. “As a medical community, we need to ensure equal access to preventative care and refashion our prescribing practices so they are agnostic to patients’ gender, ethnicity, background, and beliefs.” “As with most entrenched issues, the disparity is multifactorial,” Amin told Healthline. “Changing course will require a more aligned system of care that addresses these inequities head-on. We need to push toward a more algorithmic approach to cardiac care. Similar to goal directed therapy for treating blood-borne infections, we know the right thing to do and when. We need to ensure that our prescribing practices have automatic triggers and reminders so that patients do not fall through the gaps. More can also be done to strengthen primary care while focusing on culturally sensitive care.” Experts say there isn’t just one reason for the disparity. “While I don’t think it is intentional, women get lesser care than men in healthcare settings,” said Dr. Yu-Ming Ni, a cardiologist and lipidologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in California who was not involved in the study. “In the recent past, the American Heart Association has worked to raise awareness of heart disease in women. There is a fallacy that men get heart disease more than women, but that is ignoring the fact that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women.” “We need to keep pushing awareness and place more emphasis on gender-based care. I think about disparities a lot— not just gender but socioeconomic ones as well,” Ni told Healthline. I hope that the newer generation of doctors is more aware of gender bias.” Women develop cardiovascular disease less often than men, according to a study
published in 2023. However, they have a higher rate of death from cardiovascular disease. The authors of the study note that cardiovascular disease is under-recognized and often untreated in women. “Despite statins reducing risks of heart attacks and strokes, historically in the U.S., women have also received less aggressive treatment than men in terms of cholesterol management,” Mehta said. Cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins are recommended for both men and women with coronary artery disease. They can help reduce symptoms and prevent heart attacks and death. If statins alone do not lower cholesterol levels, the European Society of Cardiologists recommends adding a second medication, such as ezetimibe (Zetia/Vytorin). “I have noticed that most patients with statin intolerance are women,” Ni said. “This might explain less ongoing treatment with statins, but it wouldn’t explain the disparity in initial prescriptions for them.” Despite the same recommendations for men and women, women are less likely to reduce their cholesterol and achieve the target level. “Cholesterol-lowering drugs save lives and prevent heart attacks and should be prescribed to all patients with coronary artery disease,” Dr. Nina Johnston, a study author and cardiologist at Uppsala University in Sweden, said in a press release. “Unfortunately, our study shows that women are missing out on these essential medications.” “Our findings should be a wake-up call about the under-treatment of women with heart disease,” she added. “Equal prescribing practices are needed so that women receive all recommended therapies and are protected from adverse outcomes.”"," Less than 60 60 to 69 70 to 79 80 and older Men with heart disease are treated for high cholesterol more often than women with heart disease, according to research presented at the ESC Preventive Cardiology 2024, a scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology.

Experts recommend regular stair climbing for overall health, aiming for three to six flights of stairs daily. To incorporate more stair climbing into your health and fitness routine, take the stairs whenever possible. improved nitric oxide production improved vascular endothelial function reduced cardiovascular risk factors The benefits of exercise are well-known, from better heart health and lower blood pressure to improved mood. There are many ways to be active on a regular basis, such as taking the stairs. According to the authors of a new study, climbing stairs is associated with improved heart health and longevity. “One of the main motivators behind this study was that I was often seeing people take the lifts at work rather than taking the stairs — even medical students 10 years younger than myself,” Sophie Paddock, MD, of the University of East Anglia and Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital Foundation Trust, in the United Kingdom, told Healthline. “I’d like to think that we can now use the results of this study to encourage people to incorporate more physical activity into their daily lives. We hope that our research will influence policy makers and health care professionals to promote physical activity and stair climbing.” The research is being presented at the European Society of Cardiology’s Preventive Cardiology conference April 25–27 in Athens, Greece. The study has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. For this study, researchers conducted a meta-analysis, examining nine studies with 480,479 participants. Participants included healthy adults ages 35 to 84 and adults with a prior history of heart attack or peripheral arterial disease. Following the analysis, researchers found that stair climbing was linked to a 24% reduced risk of death from any cause and a 39% lower risk of death from heart disease. Climbing stairs was also associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. According to the authors, the next steps for the research will be to objectively evaluate the optimal number of stairs people should be climbing each day and at what intensity. “The current research is heavily reliant on patients recalling their day-to-day activities, which can lead to bias,” Paddock explained. John Higgins MD, a sports cardiologist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston, not involved in the study, told Healthline exercise strengthens the heart muscle and improves vascular function, among other positive effects, such as: Cardiovascular disease affects the heart and blood vessels. Aerobic exercises such as walking, running, biking, and swimming can help strengthen the heart and improve its ability to function. “Aerobic exercise can help the heart pump blood more efficiently, reducing the risk of heart failure,” Benjamin Boudreaux, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Columbia’s Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, told Healthline. Boudreaux was not involved in the study. “Climbing stairs is a form of aerobic exercise, which provides numerous heart health benefits,” Boudreaux noted. Regular aerobic exercise helps lower blood pressure over a 24-hour period, which increases flexibility in the blood vessels and reduces the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension), Boudreaux explained. Exercise also increases levels of “good” HDL cholesterol, he said, which helps reduce “bad” LDL cholesterol and the risk of atherosclerosis, he said. In addition, Boudreaux noted that exercise helps regulate blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity, which helps reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and related blood vessel damage. The new study did not make a specific recommendation for stair climbing frequency. According to experts interviewed for this article, aiming for three to six flights of stairs per day (assuming each flight is 10 to 15 stairs) is a good goal for overall health. A 2023 study suggests climbing more than five flights of stairs (or 50 stair steps) daily may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke, heart attacks, and blood clots. “When you increase your heart rate through stair climbing, it helps strengthen the heart muscle and makes it more efficient at pumping blood, so the heart works less now to complete its daily mission of pumping blood packed with nutrients and oxygen throughout your body,” Higgins explained. Boudreaux recommended climbing a minimum of at least one flight of stairs daily. “Climbing stairs is considered to be a vigorous physical activity. The amount of time doing this activity may largely depend on the individual’s motive (it could be for fitness or staying active throughout the day),” he said. Even if you don’t have stairs in your home, there are plenty of ways to incorporate more stair climbing into your daily life. For instance, if you work in an office or other type of building with multiple floors, you can take the stairs instead of the elevator. Other buildings, such as hotels, malls, airports, doctor’s offices, and hospitals, have stairwells that are typically available for public use. “You are more likely to get to your destination faster by climbing a few flights of stairs than being in an elevator that may stop multiple times. At the airport, taking the stairs is a good way to get your legs moving before sitting during a flight,” Boudreaux said. To get the most out of stair climbing, experts recommend picking up the pace to strengthen your cardiorespiratory fitness. You could also try the stair climbing machine at the gym if you belong to one, or invest in a sturdy fitness step and perform step-ups at home. Climbing stairs is linked to improved heart health and longevity, according to new research. Experts advise climbing stairs each day, aiming for three to six flights. To incorporate more stair climbing into your day, take the stairs whenever possible, whether at the office or other public venues, use a stair climber at the gym, or perform step-ups on a fitness step at home."," According to the authors of a new study, climbing stairs is associated with improved heart health and longevity. “One of the main motivators behind this study was that I was often seeing people take the lifts at work rather than taking the stairs — even medical students 10 years younger than myself,” Sophie Paddock, MD, of the University of East Anglia and Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital Foundation Trust, in the United Kingdom, told Healthline.

104,Health,FDA Finds Traces of Bird Flu Virus in Grocery Store Milk But Says It's Still Safe,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/fda-bird-flu-virus-milk,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gallon-milk-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 25, 2024",The FDA has announced that traces of the bird flu virus have been detected in dairy milk. Here’s what to know.,"The FDA has discovered the presence of the avian flu virus in dairy milk. Commercially available milk products are still believed to be safe for consumers because they have undergone pasteurization. Raw milk products may carry the avian flu virus, in addition to other risks. Avian influenza, or bird flu, has been detected in dairy milk in the United States, but the FDA has indicated that the disease has a low likelihood of causing illness in humans. In an advisory
issued this week, the Food and Drug Administration announced that they — along with the CDC and the USDA — are investigating the presence of H5N1 avian influenza in dairy cows and their milk. The disease, known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), is very contagious and often deadly in poultry, but, despite its name, is not readily transmissible to humans, though some infections have occurred. The FDA has stated that despite identifying bird flu in raw milk, as well as traces of the H5N1 virus in milk sold at grocery stores, commercial dairy products are still safe to consume because almost all of them (99%) have undergone pasteurization
. However, the virus may be present in raw milk products, which the organization has continuously warned
consumers about. William Schaffner, MD, a Professor of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, concurred with the FDAs assessment that transmission of the disease is unlikely, especially from milk. “This is a virus that does not have the genetic capacity to be transmitted from person to person. And this virus has been around in the world, in bird populations for a decade, and it still has not acquired this capacity,” he told Healthline. “I have in my hand a cup of coffee with milk in it. I put milk into my oatmeal. I had no concern about it,” he added. According to the latest information
, the FDA has confirmed the detection of HPAI in dairy cow herds in several states, including Idaho, Kansas, New Mexico, Texas, and more. In an announcement yesterday, regulators issued a federal order requiring testing for and reporting of HPAI in livestock. Despite being found in dairy cows, to date, regulators and public health entities are only aware of two cases of HPAI transmission to humans. At the beginning of April, the CDC announced
that an individual in Texas was confirmed to carry the disease. The patient had been exposed to dairy cattle, but the report wasn’t more specific. The exposure resulted in symptoms of conjunctivitis (“pink eye”), and the individual was subsequently treated with antiviral medication for flu. A previous case
of transmission occurred in Colorado in 2022 when an individual known to be working around HPAI-infected poultry tested positive for the disease. The individual reported symptoms of fatigue and was again treated with an antiviral. Diseases transmitted between animals and humans, known as zoonotic diseases
, are very common. According to the CDC, more than 60% of infectious diseases in humans can be spread from animals, and 75% of emerging diseases in people come from animals. Transmission can also occur between different species of animals, such as birds and cows. “When wild birds set down to drink water and feed along their migratory path, they can actually excrete the virus out of their saliva and their urine and their poop, and put it into the environment in such a way that it can occasionally get into mammals,” said Schaffner. From there, it can easily spread across feedlots and, in this case, the milk supply. “Not surprisingly, in a herd that’s jammed close together, where there’s a lot of cow saliva and urine and poop, it can be transmitted among the cows,” he said. Though virus particles of HPAI have been detected in pasteurized milk, the risk of transmission of HPAI is extremely unlikely, but it may be possible in raw milk. “The FDA does not have any concerns that our milk supply is contaminated and see no health threat or concerns for consumers at this time,” Joseph Lambson, PharmD, Director of the New Mexico Poison and Drug Information Center, and an Assistant Professor at the University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy, told Healthline. “They still highly urge against using raw milk or products that utilize raw milk for the same concerns that they’ve been saying for years and years, which is you’re just at increased risk of infection. And so you can definitely include this highly virulent form of avian flu to that list,” said Lambson. The FDA warns that raw milk can carry dangerous pathogens, including salmonella, listeria, and campylobacter. Commercially available milk undergoes pasteurization, which is a process in which milk is heated and then cooled in order to destroy pathogens. The process has been used on milk for public health purposes for over one hundred years in the United States. “Pasteurization is required by the FDA if you’re moving milk products from one state to another. They have to follow a specific temperature and time. That should kill the virus. So the inactive virus may be in the milk, but it’s not going to be able to replicate, so you can drink it safely,” said Sylvia Ley, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. Viral fragments may remain in milk after pasteurization but are not considered to pose a risk to consumer health. Additionally, the FDA and USDA have stated that milk from sick cows is actively being diverted from the food supply. Lambson encourages anyone concerned that they have consumed a contaminated product to contact their poison control center, where they can get medical advice about symptoms to look for and whether or not they should seek medical treatment. “Additionally, it also helps from a surveillance purpose to see if we’re having an increase of exposures,” he said. The FDA has discovered the presence of avian influenza in dairy milk. Regulators have cautioned that there is little to no risk of infection in commercial milk due to pasteurization. However, the virus may be present in raw milk. Only two known cases of transmission of the virus are known to have occurred recently in humans."," Raw milk products may carry the avian flu virus, in addition to other risks. Avian influenza, or bird flu, has been detected in dairy milk in the United States, but the FDA has indicated that the disease has a low likelihood of causing illness in humans. In an advisory issued this week, the Food and Drug Administration announced that they — along with the CDC and the USDA — are investigating the presence of H5N1 avian influenza in dairy cows and their milk. The disease, known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), is very contagious and often deadly in poultry, but, despite its name, is not readily transmissible to humans, though some infections have occurred."

However, only about 2% are accurate compared to public health and nutrition guidelines. Experts are concerned about TikTok’s influence, given the potential for misinformation.

The United States Food & Drug Administration
(or applicable governing body in your country) Food and nutrient databases from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institutes of Health Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) The fact that fad diets and nutrition advice are widely shared on social media platforms like TikTok is not new news. However, a new survey conducted by MyFitnessPal and Dublin City University suggests the majority of diet and nutrition trends on TikTok are not aligned with public health and nutrition guidelines. Even more concerning is that of the 2,000 Millennial and Gen-Z TikTok users surveyed, 57% of respondents said they had been influenced by or frequently tried nutrition trends they saw on the platform. Yet, only 2.1% of nutrition content on the platform is accurate, according to an AI-based analysis of more than 67,000 videos conducted with Dublin City University that compared TikTok videos against regulated public health and nutrition guidelines. “The latest research conducted by MyFitnessPal, which partnered with Dublin City University, uncovered that there is a tremendous amount of health and nutrition misinformation on TikTok,” says Dr. Joan Salge Blake, EdD, RDN, LDN, FAND, a nutrition professor at Boston University, author of Nutrition & You, and the host of the nutrition & health podcast, Spot On!, who was not involved in the study. The new data comes as part of a two-part project. First, MyFitnessPal polled 2,000 Millennial and Gen-Z TikTok users. Of the 57% of people who reported being influenced by TikTok health and nutrition trends, more than two-thirds (67%) said they tried at least one of the viral ideas a few times weekly. Furthermore, 30% of respondents said they tried the TikTok trend despite potential health risks, and 31% reported feeling an adverse effect from a “fad diet” trend. “Every individual has different needs, and when people try to adapt to the same fads or concepts, individuals . . . can create nutrient deficiencies by removing whole food groups, and if they are not getting what they need, they will eventually negatively affect mood, focus, and cognition ,” says Amy Goldsmith RDN, LDN, the founder of Kindred Nutrition. MyFitnessPal also teamed up with Dublin City University to analyze more than 67,0000 videos with nutrition content using artificial intelligence and compared them to regulated health and nutrition guidance. Preliminary findings indicated that only 2.1% was accurate when checked against this guidance. And the 97.9% of content not included was classified as inaccurate, partially accurate, or uncertain because of a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim. Despite TikTok’s influence, Gen-Z users said they trusted content from qualified registered dieticians over information dispensed by uncredentialed influencers. “Unfortunately, this doesn’t stop them from adopting trends from unqualified people,” worries Emily Van Eck, MS, RD. “That so many people are adopting baseless trends and being harmed by them is unsettling.” Blake shared similar sentiments. “While extremely concerning, these findings support other studies that have identified that unqualified individuals are providing nutrition and health misinformation and disinformation,” Blake says. It’s also in step with TikTok’s broader influence. PEW Research from 2023 indicated that the number of U.S. adults regularly getting their news from TikTok quadrupled in three years, from 3% in 2020 to 14% in 2023. About one-third (32%) of people ages 18 to 29 reported regularly getting their news via TikTok.  While one dietitian is also concerned by the findings, she notes it’s important to acknowledge the manner in which the survey was conducted leaves room for flaws. “It is vital to acknowledge that at this time, we do not have enough evidence to suggest whether — and if so, to what extent — AI can, on its own, determine whether a video or piece of content follows public health and nutrition guidelines,” said Maddie Pasquariello, MS, RDN, who was not involved in the study. Additionally, while bias is an issue on TikTok, especially when influencers are paid to promote certain products, Pasquariello cautions that MyFitnessPal is not unbiased, either. The app dispenses nutrition information. “We could make the deduction that by telling folks not to turn to TikTok, they might turn to MyFitnessPal instead — and, as they suggest, use the “tool” on their website, bringing more people to their platform,” Pasquariello says. “They have as much of a vested interest in keeping eyes and clicks on their website as TikTok does.” A small study
of 20 women with an average age of about 22 who self-monitored their diet on MyFitnessPal indicated that experiences varied and that, while it can be useful for some, it could become harmful if used obsessively. Blake says the misformation found on TikTok poses numerous health risks. “Nutrition misinformation can be dangerous if followed without the guidance of a person’s health care provider and the nutrition expertise of an RDN,” Blake says. “Many folks are on medications and have chronic medical issues such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure for which they must follow a specific diet to meet their nutrition needs. Also, extreme dieting and the promotion of elimination diets that are often promoted via social media can feed into disordered eating and malnutrition, especially among young adults.” However, as the survey indicates, qualified individuals are dispensing information on social media. “Though it’s never where I recommend folks go first for nutrition advice, social media can still be a useful tool for spreading awareness about public health initiatives and evidence-based nutrition advice,” Pasquariello says. “Though they’re few and far between, some influencers and experts know what they’re talking about and are extremely rigorous in the content they put out.” How can you determine who is who? Experts say following these simple tips can help. Credentials matter. “Health coaches and nutritionists — and many of the “experts” who grace our podcast feeds — are not required to undergo any training [in many states] to give themselves these titles,” Pasquariello says. “They often fail to properly synthesize research or consider new studies in the context of our understanding of the evidence at large, as they never received training in parsing literature for a lay audience. Their aim is to get views and listens and to make money.” Pasquariello notes that RDs must undergo extensive, science-focused education and hundreds of hours of training under supervision, including work in clinical nutrition and research settings. “Beyond that, they have to stay up to date on the latest research and obtain continuing education credits in order to retain their credentials year to year,” she says. In short, look for RD/RDN in a person’s bio. “The RDN has also passed a national exam administered by this accrediting body,” Blake says. Starting in 2024, all RDN candidates will be required to hold a master of science degree before taking this national exam.” Pasquariello suggests fact-checking information, including any studies touted by influencers — even RDs/RDNs. “It’s important that any RD you’re getting nutrition advice from is able to present peer-reviewed science-based information to back up the advice they’re dispensing or claims they’re making,” Pasquariello says. “Optimally, this means randomized, controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses.” Read past the abstract at the top of the study. “So many people who push out nutrition advice online fail to actually read a study in its entirety before making sweeping claims about something that may have appeared in one line of the abstract of a long piece of scientific literature,” Pasquariello says. Additionally, see if there are more recent studies. “This is one of the most important ones, but I think it is the least talked about,” Pasquariello says. “As medical professionals and RDs, we have an obligation to look at any new study in the context of the literature at large. Whenever a new study comes out that seems to upend what we know about a subject or presents an entirely new direction to the research, I like to picture the findings as a tiny dot inside a huge circle. Yes, we should consider new pieces of evidence, but always in the context of everything else in that arena to date.” Pasquariello says some popular buzzwords are red flags, including: “I also grow wary whenever someone mentions supplements, gut health, cortisol, hormone imbalance, gut reset, heal your gut lining, and the like without clarifying explicitly what they mean and in what scenarios,” she says. If you’re judicious, you’ll soon realize just how often these terms are thrown around as vague, eye-catching mentions rather than being fully explained or contextualized. Van Eck suggests checking in with yourself before following advice found on TikTok. “Keep in mind that one person’s experience is not proof that something is right for you, even if they are an expert,” she says. “Think critically about the tip they are offering.” She suggests asking yourself: “If it seems like they’re showing off their body, they likely feel as if their body is their business card,” Van Eck says. “That is a red flag.” While the information found online can be murky, there are evidence-based resources people can turn to. The experts Healthline spoke with recommended the following: Additionally, in-person resources, such as through RDs and RDNs or WIC programs, can also assist in the form of accurate information. New data from MyFitnessPal indicates that nearly 6 in 10 Gen-Z and Millenial TikTok users are heavily influenced by health and nutrition content found on the platform. However, in a further analysis with Dublin City University, preliminary findings suggested that only 2.1% of the information was accurate compared to regulated health and nutrition guidelines. Experts say it’s best to seek information from RDs and RDNs, who have vast training in nutrition. Fact-checking claims by looking at the actual study, reading past the abstract, and seeking data from additional studies to support or refute the claim made by a person online is also helpful. Seeing an RD or RDN in person or using websites from regulated bodies for information, such as the CDC or FDA, can also help you find more accurate insights and data to support your health."," However, a new survey conducted by MyFitnessPal and Dublin City University suggests the majority of diet and nutrition trends on TikTok are not aligned with public health and nutrition guidelines.

106,Health,Consistently Getting a Good Night’s Sleep Can Lower Your Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/consistently-getting-a-good-nights-sleep-can-lower-your-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/older-female-sleeping-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 24, 2024",New research finds that consistently getting good quality sleep can help reduce cardiovascular disease risk.,"A new study found that older adults who maintained good sleep quality over a five-year period had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. However, even people with good sleep quality only at one point in the study had a lower cardiovascular risk compared to those with ongoing poor sleep quality. The study focused on poor sleep quality, but sleep disorders such as sleep apnea can also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Sleep and health are intimately connected, with poor sleep linked
to a greater chance of developing obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, and anxiety. While research shows the importance of high-quality sleep, many studies have looked at people’s sleep patterns at one point in time. But sleep habits can change over the course of a person’s life, so a single measurement may not always show the whole picture for someone’s health over their lifetime. To gain a better understanding of how changes in sleep patterns affect health, researchers from China examined people’s sleep patterns at two different time points, several years apart. As with earlier research, they found that higher quality sleep was linked to better health — in this case, a lower risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. These benefits were greatest for people who slept well at the start and end of the study. However, even people who had high quality sleep only at one point in time saw a lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those with ongoing poor sleep quality. The new study was published April 23 in JAMA Network Open
. The study included over 15,000 retired workers from China who completed questionnaires and had medical examinations about five years apart. Researchers collected genetic data from some people, which was used to determine their cardiovascular risk. People were excluded from the study if they already had cardiovascular disease or cancer at the start of the study. Researchers used the questionnaires to determine people’s sleep quality. “Favorable” sleep was based on four factors: bedtime between 10 pm and midnight, sleeping 7 to 8 hours per night, good or fair sleep quality, and napping 60 minutes or less during the day. Researchers found that people with “favorable” sleep patterns at either point in time were less likely to have a cardiovascular disease event (coronary heart disease or stroke) compared to people with poor sleep patterns at both times. Even people who had good sleep at the beginning and worse sleep at the follow-up visit had a lower cardiovascular risk compared to those with ongoing poor sleep. However, people who reported high sleep quality (persistent favorable sleep) at both time points had the lowest cardiovascular risk. This included a 16% lower risk of coronary heart disease and a 34% lower risk of stroke. When researchers took into account the effect of people’s genes, they found that those with a low genetic risk for cardiovascular disease and favorable sleep patterns at both time points had the lowest cardiovascular risk. The lowest-risk group had a 35% lower risk of coronary heart disease and a 52% lower risk of stroke compared to people with high genetic risk and ongoing poor sleep. However, the findings showed that even people with an intermediate or high genetic risk for cardiovascular disease have benefits from good sleep quality, with a 64% lower risk in the good sleep quality group. So, “even with the presence of genetic factors associated with cardiovascular disease, good sleep quality decreased people’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease,” said Cheng-Han Chen, MD, interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, Calif. The results of the new study are similar to earlier research that used survey data to assess people’s sleep quality, said Safia S. Khan, MD, a specialist in sleep disorders and an associate professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine and the Department of Neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. However, the new study is one of the first to look at changes in sleep patterns and the risks from cardiovascular disease over time, she told Healthline. In another study that assessed sleep quality at two points in time, researchers followed middle-aged European participants for nine years. They found a lower cardiovascular risk for people with higher-quality sleep patterns and for those who improved their sleep habits over time. These results are similar to the findings in this latest study. The earlier study also showed that many people have consistent sleep patterns, with only 19% of participants changing their sleep patterns over the course of the study. “For middle-aged people and retirees, their sleep patterns are not going to change significantly from year to year,” said Khan. “So essentially, we can assume that these people [in the new study] had the same type of sleep pattern before the survey was conducted.” That means the results of the study are a good indication of the link between cardiovascular outcomes and sleep patterns, she said. Another unique aspect of the study is that it focused on retired older adults, who may have more natural sleep patterns than middle-aged people, who often adjust their sleep habits to their work schedules, the authors wrote. Although the study fits with earlier research, it has certain limitations. For example, because the participants were all older adults from China, the results may not apply to younger people or those with different racial or ethnic backgrounds. So “we need to have more studies from other regions of the world,” said Khan, “to see if these results can be replicated in those other areas.” In addition, this was an observational study, which means “it doesn’t necessarily show that poor sleep quality causes the cardiovascular condition,” Chen told Healthline, only that there is a link between the two. “It could be that there are other factors, such as depression or stress, that cause both poor sleep quality and cardiovascular disease,” he said. Researchers didn’t take into account all of these other factors. For example, “they didn’t look at other aspects of sleep quality that we consider very important,” said Chen, “specifically, sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.” Khan agreed. “We don’t know how many people had sleep apnea, insomnia, restless legs, or other sleep disturbances,” she said. “Or if their spouses had significant sleep apnea or snoring that could be disturbing [people’s] sleep.” Although Khan thinks future studies should take into account these other factors, she said we already know that sleep quality is an important aspect of heart health. The American Heart Association even includes getting healthy sleep as one of its eight essential measures
for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health, alongside managing weight, controlling cholesterol, eating better, and staying active. “Whenever I talk to my patients about cardiovascular health and improving their cardiovascular risk factors, I always mention sleep quality and the idea of getting good sleep, as well as asking if they’ve been checked for sleep apnea,” said Chen. In a study of over 15,000 retired workers, researchers found that those who maintained good sleep quality over a five-year period had the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically coronary heart disease and stroke. However, even people who had good-quality sleep at only one point in the study had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those with poor sleep throughout the study. The study relied on questionnaires to assess people’s sleep quality, which may not be accurate. In addition, researchers didn’t assess other factors that can affect cardiovascular disease risk, such as sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and depression."," However, even people with good sleep quality only at one point in the study had a lower cardiovascular risk compared to those with ongoing poor sleep quality. However, even people who had high quality sleep only at one point in time saw a lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those with ongoing poor sleep quality. When researchers took into account the effect of people’s genes, they found that those with a low genetic risk for cardiovascular disease and favorable sleep patterns at both time points had the lowest cardiovascular risk. However, the findings showed that even people with an intermediate or high genetic risk for cardiovascular disease have benefits from good sleep quality, with a 64% lower risk in the good sleep quality group."
107,Health,Antacids May Increase Your Risk of Migraine Attacks or Severe Headaches,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/antacids-increase-migraine-risk,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/female-headache-couch-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 24, 2024",New research suggests that people who take antacids may be at greater risk for migraine attacks and severe headaches.,"A study of more than 11,000 adults suggests an association between migraine attacks or severe headaches and acid-suppressing medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). An estimated 20% of adults in the U.S. have GERD, which can cause heartburn and acid reflux. These types of drugs are widely used to treat them. However, the study does not state that these classes of acid-suppressing medications cause migraine attacks or severe headaches. People who take antacids may be at greater risk for migraine attacks and severe headaches, a new study using data from more than 11,000 people suggests. The study, published in Neurology Clinical Practice, [EMBARGOED UNTIL 4PM EST], identified the potential link between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like esomeprazole (Nexium) and omeprazole (Prilosec), antacid supplements, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) like famotidine (Pepcid AC) or cimetidine. The risk of migraine and severe headache, when compared with people who used no acid-suppression therapy, was 70% higher for those using PPIs, 40% higher for those using H2RAs, and 30% higher for those taking generic antacids. All drugs examined in the study were prescription only. The data did not look at most over-the-counter medications. Some of them were made available at nonprescription strength during the study, but those were not included. Acid reflux, a condition in which stomach acids and contents can return to the esophagus, causing irritation, burping, and burning pain, is an aspect of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
, about 20% of Americans have GERD. Those who are overweight or obese, pregnant, or either smoke or are exposed to secondhand smoke regularly are at the highest risk for GERD, but anyone can develop it. The study used data from adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
from the years 1999 to 2004. That survey is a cross-sectional analysis that has been continuously conducted since 1999, but only in those first five years did it contain a question about headaches and migraine attacks. The study results are associative, so the results do not suggest that antacids are causing migraine episodes or severe headaches. Dr. Medhat Mikhael, MD, pain management specialist and medical director of the non-operative program at the Spine Health Center at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, who was not involved in the study, told Healthline that there’s not one known connection between acid reflux and migraine episodes, but all PPI drugs, H2 blockers, and antacids are known to produce side effects like headache, nausea, and fatigue. “One theory is that it is a problem with the person’s central nervous system or glutamate level, which is one of the pain pathway facilitators, and that might link acid reflux disease and headaches,” Mikhael said. “When acid is overproduced and retained, it causes an inflammatory cascade in the mucosa of the stomach and esophagus.” He noted that several mechanisms could be behind the triggering of the headache or migraine. The first would be the use of PPI, as the class of drugs can interfere with the absorption of magnesium and other vitamins, which then can trigger headaches and worsen migraine episodes. “Another theory is the inflammatory cascade reaction that starts at the GI level can trigger the central nervous system to facilitate the release of the calcitonin gene-related peptides that would trigger migraine,” Mikhael added. Dr. Clifford Segil, DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, who was also not involved in the study, told Healthline that, in general, high levels of stress could create conditions for GERD or migraine. “In my clinical practice, I see countless patients with increased life stress causing disabling headaches, and many of these patients’ increased life stress also causes disabling GERD,” Segil said. “It is challenging as a neurologist to explain why any stomach acid level-changing medications would cause a change in a patient’s brain to increase or decrease the frequency of headaches or migraines, but it easy as a neurologist to blame increased life stress on causing patients to have migraine headaches and GERD.” PPIs are a widely used treatment for GERD that can halt the production of acid and relieve heartburn. They take longer to take effect than H2RAs but tend to have more lasting results, with the intended use being between four and 12 weeks. Mikhael pointed out that PPIs’ effect on magnesium absorption in the body could have a strong role in the development of migraine episodes or severe headaches, and the fact that this class of drug is so often used could be a possible connection. Segil again pointed to stress as a significant factor but noted the connection between strong GERD and headaches. “Proton pump inhibitors are the most potent acid-decreasing medications available and are newer and work better than old H2(histamine) blocking medications and antacids,” Segil said. “Patients with increased life stress would be expected to produce more acid as a stress response, which is what I see in clinical practice. Patients with increased life stress would also be expected to have more frequent headaches,” Segil said. He added, “I am not surprised to see the treatment group requiring the strongest acid-decreasing family of medications, PPIs, to have the most frequent headaches as a comorbidity. I was surprised to see the placebo group in the weakest of the stomach acid-producing medications to have the highest number of migraines, which was 20% of the placebo group versus 22% of the patients taking antacid supplements.” A study of more than 11,000 adults suggests an association between migraine attacks or severe headaches and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like esomeprazole (Nexium) and omeprazole (Prilosec), antacid supplements, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) like famotidine (Pepcid AC) or cimetidine. An estimated 20% of adults in the U.S. have GERD, which can cause heartburn and acid reflux; these drugs are widely used to treat them.

108,Health,'Ozempic Personality': Why You May Not Act Like Yourself on Weight Loss Drugs,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/ozempic-personality-change,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/female-chair-phone-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 23, 2024","Can weight loss drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound really alter your personality? Health experts explain what you should know about “Ozempic…","“Ozempic personality” is a side effect reported by some users of popular GLP-1 obesity and diabetes medications. The term refers to a cluster of mental health issues, including increased anxiety, depression, and anhedonia. Experts contacted by Healthline disputed the term and reaffirmed that GLP-1 medications are safe and effective. Worse mood Increased feelings of anxiety and depression Feelings of anhedonia, or lacking an interest in previously enjoyed activities Decreased libido (less interest in sex) First, there was “Ozempic face,” then “Ozempic butt,” and now there’s a new side effect known as “Ozempic personality,” being reported among users of the popular drug — but what is it, and is there any scientific backing? Terms like “Ozempic face” and “Ozempic butt” have gained traction among the general public to describe the profound weight loss effects of Ozempic and similar drugs. These drugs (which include Wegovy, Mounjaro, Zepbound, and others) belong to a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). These medications work by simulating a hormone secreted in the gut that slows digestion, makes you feel more full, and increases feelings of satiety in the brain. The drugs have proven incredibly effective for weight loss, with some patients losing 20% of their body weight. Such powerful medication has created a whole new vocabulary for how people talk about their experiences, leading to terms like “Ozempic butt.” While these terms are certainly not valid scientific terms, they can potentially be indicators of side effects. The latest term, “Ozempic personality,” which has been reported across social media and has shown up in various media outlets, including the NY Post and The Daily Mail, suggests that patients using GLP-1 drugs may experience changes in their mood and demeanor. Some have gone on to say that the drugs have caused increased anxiety, depression, and even suicidal ideation. It should be noted that, despite these anecdotal reports, a large study
recently found no link between GLP-1 medications and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, experts contacted by Healthline refuted many of the claims made about “Ozempic personality” and decried the negative light that it puts on individuals using the drugs. “Whoever is coming up with this stuff really doesn’t get it,” Caroline Apovian, MD, a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and the co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, told Healthline. Sun Kim, MD, an Associate Professor of Endocrinology at Stanford Health, told Healthline: “GLP-1s can change your relationship to food. Food is an integral part of social activity, and when it is less important to you, it can change your social interactions. My patients, especially those who have diabetes or significant comorbidities associated with obesity, are mostly happy with their new lifestyle on GLP-1s. They can worry less about food; they can be more active.” While there is no single definition for the term, it encompasses a cluster of symptoms or feelings. The most commonly reported symptoms of “Ozempic personality” are: These negative feelings are generally attributed to changes in the dopamine or “reward center” of the brain. But it’s not entirely clear how GLP-1 drugs are interacting with dopamine in the brain. Derek Daniels, PhD, a Professor and Chair of the Department of Biological Sciences at the University at Buffalo, has studied the effects of GLP-1 medications on thirst and drinking behavior in animal models. “As we’re getting these signals from the process of eating or drinking, it’s all feeding back to the dopamine systems, making them less responsive to more eating or drinking,” he told Healthline. “Whether the GLP-1 is making an animal feel full faster and then those signals are what’s turning down dopamine or if GLP-1 is acting directly on the dopamine receptors, so that they’re less responsive, I don’t know the answer to that,” said Daniels. But there could be a simpler answer, too: eating less, losing weight, and giving up foods you love is hard. “You’re soothing yourself with all these bad foods and developing obesity, and so now you don’t feel like rewarding yourself with sugary food, and you’re in a bad mood. It’s not the Ozempic that did that. It was the addiction in the first place. That’s how I think people should look at this,” said Apovian. By directly or indirectly affecting the dopamine system, GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy might play a larger role in diminishing cravings of all kinds. “It doesn’t surprise me that there are overall changes in people that are on these drugs. I think some of them are probably subtle, but in animal models, these drugs turn down almost any motivated behavior that we can imagine,” said Daniels. Researchers have looked at the role these medications can play in other addictive disorders, including drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. A review
of the medical literature published in 2022 found that GLP-1 drugs resulted in “potent reductions” in alcohol and substance use. The report also states, “individuals suffering from obesity and individuals suffering from addiction have overlapping brain dysregulations, and the anti‐obesity effects of GLP‐1 receptor agonists support the potential usefulness of GLP‐1 receptor agonists for the treatment of substance use disorder and alcohol use disorder.” Another study from that same year found that GLP-1 drugs could also “represent an important step in the development of novel drug therapies for cocaine use disorder.” Experts agreed that they do not like the negative connotations of the term “Ozempic personality,” but that doesn’t mean that individuals using GLP-1 drugs won’t deal with real mental health issues. “I don’t like that headline. I don’t think it’s changing personalities at all. I think it’s changing the way that people are thinking about food,” said Rachel Goldman, PhD, a licensed psychologist in private practice in NYC and clinical assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at New York University. Goldman, who works with patients with obesity and those who have undergone bariatric surgery, understands the challenges, both mental and physical, that patients go through during weight loss. “It’s going to help you become healthier. It’s going to help you on this health journey, but depending on what’s going on in your life, it may or may not improve those depressive symptoms. It’s unrealistic to think that just losing weight is going to make everybody happy and healthy.” She encourages anyone taking weight loss drugs who is experiencing mental health issues to address them with a healthcare professional. Daniels adds that it’s also important to see the big picture with any course of treatment: “These are really promising drugs. I think you have to balance the risks and the benefits of the drug with what you’re trying to treat. Clearly, obesity is a huge health problem that carries all kinds of horrible risks. So, even if there is a downside to these drugs, you have to take that in the context of all of the upsides.” Reports of so-called “Ozempic personality,” have begun appearing on social media and through various news outlets. The term is not a scientific one but characterizes a sense of worsening mental health, including anxiety, depression, and anhedonia in individuals taking GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. Experts interviewed by Healthline expressed their frustration with the negative connotations of the term and reiterated that GLP-1 drugs are safe and effective. Individuals experiencing mental health issues should address them with healthcare professionals."," Worse mood Increased feelings of anxiety and depression Feelings of anhedonia, or lacking an interest in previously enjoyed activities Decreased libido (less interest in sex) First, there was “Ozempic face,” then “Ozempic butt,” and now there’s a new side effect known as “Ozempic personality,” being reported among users of the popular drug — but what is it, and is there any scientific backing? Such powerful medication has created a whole new vocabulary for how people talk about their experiences, leading to terms like “Ozempic butt.” While these terms are certainly not valid scientific terms, they can potentially be indicators of side effects."
109,Health,AFib May be More Common in People Under 65 Than Previously Thought,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/afib-more-common-younger-people,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/male-beach-dogs-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 23, 2024",A new study suggests that atrial fibrillation (AFib) may be more common in people under 65 than shown by previous research,"A new study suggests that atrial fibrillation (AFib) may be more common in people under 65 than shown by previous research. Younger people with AFib also had an increased risk of dying or hospitalization compared to similarly-aged people without AFib. Experts say it is not clear if AFib is increasing among younger people or if doctors are detecting it more often. It may be both. Atrial fibrillation (AFib or AF), a condition involving irregular heart rhythms, is more common in people under the age of 65 than previously thought, a new study shows. Adults in this age group also had an increased risk of dying and being hospitalized for heart attack, heart failure, or stroke, compared to similarly-aged people without AFib, researchers found. “Common knowledge among cardiologists is that, in people under 65, AFib is extremely uncommon and not detrimental. But there really hasn’t been any data to back that up,” study author Aditya Bhonsale, MD, a cardiac electrophysiologist at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s Heart and Vascular Institute, said in a release. The study was published April 22 in the journal Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology
. Atrial fibrillation
, the most common type of arrhythmia, affected an estimated 5.2 million Americans in 2010, with this expected to grow to 12.1 million by 2030. This condition causes the heart to beat irregularly and sometimes faster than normal, which can lead to symptoms such as feeling lightheaded, tired, or dizzy. You may also feel like your heart is fluttering, beating too quickly or hard, or skipping a beat. Left untreated, AFib can cause heart disease or make your existing heart disease worse. It also increases the risk of complications such as heart failure and stroke. “AFib is typically a disease of older people,” said Bradley Knight, MD, medical director of electrophysiology at Northwestern Medicine Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute in Chicago, who was not involved in the study. “As people get older, they can develop abnormalities in the atrium [of their heart], which can lead to atrial fibrillation.” While the risk of AFib among older adults is well known, this condition was previously thought to be not very common among younger adults. For example, a 2001 study
found that less than 1% percent of American adults younger than 55 years old had AFib, compared to 9% of people 80 years or older. Similar results were seen in a more recent European study
. In the new study, UPMC researchers found that AFib was more common in their younger patient population than what was seen in those earlier studies. To determine this, they reviewed medical records for over 67,000 adults who had at least two outpatient visits at a UPMC clinic between 2010 and 2019 related to a diagnosis of AFib. Although the average age of patients with AFib was 72 years old, nearly one-quarter were under 65, with the majority of younger patients being men. Researchers also assessed the risks of hospitalization and dying faced by younger people with AFib. Other research
shows that AFib increases the risk of dying early, but many of those studies focused on older adults. After reviewing the 10-year survival for younger patients, researchers found that men with AFib were 1.3 to 1.5 times more likely to die, compared to similarly aged men without AFib. For younger women with AFib, the risk of dying was 1.7 to 2.4 times worse compared to younger women without this condition. Many people in this younger age group had risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea. Over time, these conditions can lead to physical damage and electrical changes in the heart that result in AFib. Jim Liu, MD, a cardiologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, who was not involved in the study, said this study highlights that AFib in younger patients is a “serious condition,” especially “as AFib becomes more prevalent in younger adults and is not just isolated to elderly patients.” So is AFib really becoming more common in people under 65 years, or are doctors getting better at detecting this condition? It might be a little bit of both. “We are probably doing a better job at detecting AFib,” Liu told Healthline. For example, “so many people now have personal wearable devices, like smartwatches and other monitors, that can detect AFib.” “However, risk factors for AFib — such as obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes and hypertension — are also increasing in younger patients.” Other risk factors for AFib include consuming large amounts of alcohol and viral infections such as COVID-19
. Many of these can be modified to reduce your risk of developing AFib. “It’s important to address the risk factors for AFib,” said Liu. “This means getting conditions like [high blood pressure], sleep apnea, and diabetes under control. It also means losing weight if someone is overweight.” Even though the new study suggests that AFib may be more common in younger people than previously known, Knight said clinical guidelines don’t recommend routine screening of all patients for AFib. “[Screening] may be important in patients with risk factors, particularly older patients, and patients with heart disease or [high blood pressure],” he said, “but I don’t know that we need to screen for it in very young patients [who don’t have symptoms].” However, “[AFib] is being screened for more often due to these wearable devices that are available without a prescription,” he said. Knight thinks these kinds of devices can be useful in managing patients who are already diagnosed with AFib. For example, if someone thinks they are having possible symptoms of AFib, they can use their wearable device to record their heart rhythm and send the recording to their doctor for review. They could also record their rhythms once a week after a heart-related procedure or a change in their medications to see if their heart is staying within a normal rhythm. “These are very valuable tools, but there is also the problem of false positives,” said Knight. “A lot of young, healthy people are told they have AFib by their device,” but a follow-up with a doctor may show that it was a false positive. He recommends that anyone with heart-related symptoms such as palpitations (fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart), chest pain, or sudden shortness of breath talk with their doctor or other medical professional. “One of the tests might be for them to wear a long-term heart monitor that will detect any atrial fibrillation that they might have,” said Knight. Researchers examined the medical records of over 67,000 people with AFib. Nearly one-quarter of these patients were younger than 65 years old. AFib was previously thought to affect those over 65 years old, with rates increasing with age. However, this study suggests that this condition also impacts younger people. Many younger patients with AFib in the study had risk factors for AFib, such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea."," Atrial fibrillation (AFib or AF), a condition involving irregular heart rhythms, is more common in people under the age of 65 than previously thought, a new study shows.

110,Health,"Aspirin May Boost Your Immune System, Reduce Colorectal Cancer Risk",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/aspirin-colorectal-cancer-risk,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/older-male-taking-pills-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 22, 2024",New research suggests that low dose aspirin may help enhance your immune system and lower your risk of colorectal cancer.,"Aspirin has been shown to protect against colorectal cancer. A new study says it may do this by enhancing the body’s ability to detect cancer cells. Aspirin is not right for everyone and may be most beneficial for those with CVD risk. Your lifestyle choices can also influence your risk for colorectal cancer. Early detection through regular screenings can make colorectal cancer easier to treat. Studies have shown
that taking aspirin may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Additionally, other studies suggest
that aspirin use may also improve colorectal cancer outlook. One thing that remains unclear, however, is just how aspirin protects against colorectal cancer. The main protective mechanisms are thought to be the inhibition of the enzymes that maintain proinflammatory signals, such as prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 1 (COX-1) and prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX-2). But, there are several other interrelated mechanisms that have not yet been elucidated. According to new research published on April 22, 2024, in the journal Cancer, one of these mechanisms may be that it enhances certain aspects of the immune system. To learn more about how aspirin might protect against colorectal cancer, Italian researchers looked at tissue samples from 238 people who had surgery for colorectal cancer. They identified that 12% of these patients were aspirin users. They then compared tissue samples from cancer patients who had used aspirin with those who hadn’t. In those who used aspirin, there was less cancer spread to the lymph nodes and higher infiltration of immune cells into tumors. Further, when the researchers exposed colorectal cancer cells to aspirin in their lab, they saw greater expression of a protein called CD80 on certain immune cells. This amplified their ability to signal to other immune cells that proteins associated with cancerous cells were present, according to the study authors. They also found higher CD80 expression in the healthy rectal issue of those patients with rectal cancer. This finding suggests that aspirin creates an environment where the immune system is on the lookout for cancer cells. The principal investigator on the study — Dr. Marco Scarpa MD, PhD, of the University of Padova — further noted in a press release that absorption of aspirin in the rectum tends to be less than in the rest of the colon. “Thus, if we want to take advantage of its effects against colorectal cancer, we should think of how to guarantee that aspirin reaches the colorectal tract in adequate doses to be effective,” he said. The researchers wrote that one of the primary limitations of the study was the fact that it was retrospective and observational, meaning that they were looking back in time to see what had already happened. According to the authors, this made it impossible to analyze how long people had been taking aspirin prior to their cancer diagnoses. Additionally, the researchers noted that aspirin use was self-reported and, in some instances, people may have taken aspirin in the past, but it was obscured by the fact that they had stopped using it before entering the hospital for cancer treatment. Kubanych Takyrbashev, MD, Health & Wellness Advisor at NAO, who was not involved in the study, commented that since it was not a controlled clinical trial — a study in which one group receives the treatment that’s being studied and another comparison group receives a sham treatment — this can also introduce confounding variables and biases. Confounding variables are uncontrolled variables that could also be causing the observed effect. Biases could tip the balance in favor of a false result. “Furthermore,” said Takyrbashev, “the mechanisms underlying aspirin’s potential effects on the immune system’s response to cancer cells would require further elucidation through in-depth molecular and cellular studies.” “Before considering aspirin as a preventive measure against cancer or any other condition, individuals should be aware of the potential risks and side effects associated with its use,” said Takyrbashev. Long-term aspirin use can increase your risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and other complications, he said. This is especially true in people who have a history of gastrointestinal issues or bleeding disorders. “Additionally, aspirin can interact with other medications and might not be suitable for everyone,” said Takyrbashev, “so individuals must consult with a healthcare professional before initiating aspirin therapy.” Chris McDermott, a Certified Advanced Practice Registered Nurse with Intercoastal Consulting & Life Care Planning, who was not involved in the study, said, “Beyond aspirin, lifestyle choices play a vital role.” First of all, it’s important to get regular screenings in order to detect precancerous polyps early, he said. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends
that you get regular screening for colorectal cancer between the ages of 45 and 75. However, if there is a history of colorectal cancer in your family, they suggest that you get screened even sooner. According to the agency, early detection can make the disease easier to treat. In lieu of a colonoscopy, in which a doctor uses a scope to look directly inside your colon and rectum, you may be able to simply provide a stool sample for analysis if you are at average risk of developing colorectal cancer. McDermott added that eating a diet rich in fiber, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is also important. Getting regular exercise, moderating your alcohol consumption, and avoiding smoking can also reduce your risk. Finally, you should check whether anyone in your family has had the disease. “Genetic factors matter, so be aware of your family’s cancer history,” McDermott concluded. Studies have shown that taking low dose aspirin on a regular basis can help protect against colorectal cancer. A new study has found that one way it might provide this benefit is by enhancing the immune system’s ability to detect cancerous cells. Experts say aspirin is not for everyone since the risks may outweigh the benefits. Patients at risk for CVD are good candidates. However, if you have a history of gastrointestinal issues or bleeding disorders, it may not be right for you. Other ways to reduce your risk include eating a healthy diet, exercising, drinking only in moderation, and avoiding smoking. It’s also important to know your family’s medical history and get screened for colorectal cancer following the recommended schedule."," Additionally, other studies suggest that aspirin use may also improve colorectal cancer outlook.

111,Health,Jennifer Stone: From Disney’s ‘Wizards of Waverly Place’ to Becoming an ER Nurse,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/jennifer-stone-diabetes-nurse,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jennifer-stone-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 22, 2024","Actor Jennifer Stone may be best known for playing the role of Harper Finkle in the hit Disney series 'Wizards of Waverly Place,' but today she’s…","Actor Jennifer Stone shares her journey of living with type 1 diabetes. Stone’s diagnosis inspired her to become a registered nurse. The actor juggles working as a nurse and acting. While Jennifer Stone is best known for playing Selena Gomez’s best friend on Disney’s Wizards of Waverly Place, she is also a nurse people encounter when they find themselves in the emergency room. “I get recognized pretty frequently between the red hair and my weird voice. It’s kind of a giveaway. Even during the pandemic, when I was in full PPE – mask, gown, gloves, completely covered head to toe – people would recognize me. I was very surprised by that,” she told Healthline. “No one wants to go to the ER, and so if I can bring somebody a little bit of joy when they’re having a rough day, I look at it as such a gift,” she said. When she was 20 years old, Stone started having blurry vision, feeling extremely tired and gained 60 pounds in three months. “Obviously, I knew something was wrong, so I started going to the doctor,” she said. “I had symptoms for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, so I really confused a lot of doctors…some doctors said type 2 cause I was older, and some said type 1.” After four years of visiting different doctors and receiving different diagnoses, she was finally diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. “I got a good doctor with a good system, which for a diabetic, is vital,” Stone said. Dr. Andrew Welch, an endocrinologist at UC Health, said that even though in the United States, children and teenagers are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes compared to adults, there is an increasingly recognized and significant risk of developing type 1 diabetes as a young adult and even into later adulthood. “In fact, there was a higher overall number of new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes in adults than children in the United States because there are more adults than children,” he told Healthline. “Many adults do not get the appropriate testing for type 1 diabetes since they are assumed to have type 2 diabetes leading to delays in diagnosis and appropriate care.” During her four-year journey, Stone was in and out of doctor offices and hospitals trying to figure out her condition, she had good and bad experiences with healthcare providers. “I was in this place where I already had taken a break from acting for my health and I wanted to get a college degree, I was ready to transfer from a community college to a four-year for psychology, but with this whole experience it just really inspired me…I had a lot of really great experiences with nurses,” she said. She entered nursing school and graduated in 2019. During school, she worked in different spaces, but the variety of treating everything from a cold to a heart attack, and intensity of emergency medicine resonated with her most. “I like the multi-tasking. I like the chaos. I like the collaboration. Nursing is like that in general, but in the emergency room especially, because we don’t yet know what’s going on, and we’re in the diagnostic space where you really have to work with a group,” said Stone. Collaborating is what she likes most about acting, too. “I love collaborating with a group of people for a common goal, and I really feel that while [on set] and in the emergency room,” she said. Over the past seven years of living with type 1 diabetes, Stone tried many different treatment options. She currently uses the reusable smart insulin pen, InPen, by Medtronic. “Constantly be open with your endocrinologist about what’s on the horizon,” she said. “I would encourage my fellow diabetics to not get complacent with what they’re using because [technology] is constantly changing and evolving. Talk to your endo and see what’s best for you so you can live your best life.” Dr. Kathleen Dungan, an endocrinologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said treatment for type 1 diabetes continues to get better with more effective insulins, insulin delivery systems that closely resemble a healthy pancreas and more effective glucose monitoring devices that reduce the need for people to poke their fingers. “People who are fortunate to be able to access the latest technology in particular are much less likely to be hospitalized for severe complications and have overall better glucose levels,” Dungan told Healthline. “Better glucose levels will translate to fewer chronic complications and deaths in the long run.” However, she noted that the condition is still a challenging disease that demands lots of attention to stay healthy both physically and mentally. Stone knows this well and prioritizes self-care. “I remember a diabetes educator saying ‘you can never have a drink’ and I remember thinking I’m not even 21 yet,” Stone said. “The biggest thing I’ve learned is that I have to have balance in all things. I have to have balance in sleep, in exercise, in my diet, in everything, and how much I’m working and stress.” She also does not consider her condition disabling but rather a challenge she didn’t have before. “[It’s] made me a more well-rounded person. It’s made me stronger, and it’s forced me, in the best way, to take care of myself more,” said Stone. Feeling her best allows her to continue acting while working three 12-hour shifts per week. “So I have four other days that I can focus on acting, my other passion,” she said. When Stone was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, she felt alone and isolated. Her mom’s college roommate was the only person she knew living with the condition. Since her diagnosis, she has connected with others who have type 1 diabetes. “I’ve seen other people deal with similar challenges that I deal with, and they come out better for it or more productive or capable; it’s so inspiring to me,” she said. “My hope is to make others feel less alone in their diagnosis and to make people feel more empowered and capable despite their diagnosis.” While she aims to accomplish this with people in both her personal and professional life, she said sometimes her patients inspire her too, especially because diabetes, like other chronic conditions, is constantly evolving. “I can do the exact same thing one week, and everything is perfect, and I reach that unicorn 100 blood sugar, and then the next week, maybe my hormones are surging, or I’m stressed, and it throws everything off kilter,” said Stone. “So I’m constantly learning from patients or other diabetics about what is working for them and the tweaks they make to help them adjust to the weeks where the sky is the wrong shade of blue.”"," While Jennifer Stone is best known for playing Selena Gomez’s best friend on Disney’s Wizards of Waverly Place, she is also a nurse people encounter when they find themselves in the emergency room. “No one wants to go to the ER, and so if I can bring somebody a little bit of joy when they’re having a rough day, I look at it as such a gift,” she said. “I had symptoms for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, so I really confused a lot of doctors…some doctors said type 2 cause I was older, and some said type 1.” After four years of visiting different doctors and receiving different diagnoses, she was finally diagnosed with type 1 diabetes."

Here are their top picks.,"When math lecturer Howie Hua is working with his students—future elementary school teachers—he often talks about the power of giving yourself grace. “Is it kind of ridiculous to be asked to get it right on the first try?” he asks. “Whatever it is, you’re going to need patience with your learning. You don’t give up. You don’t say, ‘Well, I fell trying this new skill, so I guess I’m not meant to do gymnastics.’ It’s important to help students embrace that and embrace the learning journey.” This is also true for educators—especially new teachers. The early years in every teacher’s career are peppered with firsts—from navigating classroom management hurdles to establishing routines and procedures that work for a room filled with students of varying backgrounds and identities. New teachers often feel a strong desire to be flawless, to walk into the classroom and do all things perfectly. But it’s OK to make a misstep, to fall and pick yourself up again, because it’s all part of the process of working toward getting it right. Generations of educators have walked that same path—and many have documented their experiences of exactly what worked and what didn’t. We asked our community to share the books they would recommend as most important to new teachers—the books that helped guide them, shape their pedagogy, challenge their perspectives, and motivate them. Over 100 titles were suggested—including some that surprised and delighted us, like educator Lily Crull’s comment on Instagram that she reads “at least 5–6 new” young adult books that her students recommend each year. Classics like Harry and Rosemary Wong’s bestseller The First Days of School made an appearance, while some more recently published titles were heavily nominated as well: Bettina Love’s 2023 offering Punished for Dreaming easily made it into our final list. These 14 titles represent the topics that resonated most deeply with our audience. There’s no need to read all of them in the span of a year—much less before you ever set foot in the classroom. Consult them throughout your teaching journey as you grow into your role.

Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain: Promoting Authentic Engagement and Rigor Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students by Zaretta Hammond
You won’t find a list of tips and tricks within this book. Hammond probes at the very nature of the term culturally responsive teaching: interrogating what it means philosophically, dissecting its nuances, and examining the impact of this work on students’ brains. Designed to prompt self-reflection and action, Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain empowers educators in diverse classrooms to begin intentionally bolstering engagement and fostering deeper learning in a way that honors students and their identities. The First Days of School: How to Be an Effective Teacher by Harry and Rosemary Wong
Almost 30 years after its publication, this teacher-focused how-to manual currently in its fifth edition remains a “must-read,” according to our audience. Though much has changed in the school system since then, the book’s insights on evidence-based practices of high-functioning classrooms and the importance of establishing procedures and routines stand the test of time. Some critics argue that the authors’ approach to classroom management may “stifle spontaneity in classrooms and lead teachers to become overly controlling,” so consider taking the sections that don’t resonate with you with a grain of salt. Cultivating Genius: An Equity Framework for Culturally and Historically Responsive Literacy by Gholdy Muhammad
Steeped in the historical context of 19th-century Black literary societies, Muhammad’s Cultivating Genius presents a piercing exploration of current literacy practices and pedagogy. The book’s backbone is her equity framework, ""Historically Responsive Literacy,” which focuses on four “learning pursuits”: criticality and students’ intellectual, skill, and identity development. These learning pursuits, when taught in tandem, she writes, create the foundation of an ecosystem where students from all backgrounds—especially those that have been historically marginalized—can thrive and achieve academic success. The book’s aim is to foster a smarter, more self-aware, and more discerning next generation of young readers and thinkers. Grading for Equity: What It Is, Why It Matters, and How It Can Transform Schools and Classrooms by Joe Feldman
Grading isn’t always a topic of discussion in teacher preparation programs, Feldman writes, leaving many new teachers with little insight on how to set up an equitable system for their students. Grading for Equity offers an implementation road map toward ensuring accuracy, preventing bias and subjectivity, and presenting a dynamic picture of academic performance—all plotted by a 20-year veteran teacher, principal, and district administrator. The recently published second edition zooms in on the impacts grading can have on students’ mental health, as well as the role the Covid-19 pandemic played in changing perceptions around traditional grading. Building Thinking Classrooms in Mathematics, Grades K–12: 14 Teaching Practices for Enhancing Learning by Peter Liljedahl
Can you tell if your students are actually thinking or just taking notes and mimicking what they see? With the help of over 400 K–12 teachers, Liljedahl—a professor of mathematics education—spent more than a decade pinpointing the qualities of a high-functioning math classroom. It all comes down to 14 key variables, including where students work, how groups are formed, the quality of assessments, and the types of tasks used and how they are given to students. As one reviewer put it, this book doesn’t simply identify common problems in math classrooms but provides intentional, actionable takeaways and next steps. The First Six Weeks of School by Responsive Classroom
The First Six Weeks of School is a blueprint for those crucial initial days in the K–6 school year—it’s like having a seasoned mentor teacher in your back pocket. Alongside sample schedules, each chapter encompasses a week’s worth of time-specific suggestions like how to set up the flow of the day and how to create and maintain high expectations for behavior. From welcoming a new student to setting up a substitute teacher for success, this book shows teachers how to handle each new scenario with ease. Punished for Dreaming: How School Reform Harms Black Children and How We Heal by Bettina Love
A searing and unflinching examination of over four decades’ worth of prejudice and racism in education reform, as well as its disastrous legacy for generations of Black and Brown children. Love interviewed 25 Black Americans whose lives were forever changed by policies that spanned from Ronald Reagan’s presidency to the Obama administration, and the book seamlessly traces the impact of those policies into the present day. Ultimately, Love asks—and answers—the questions: What price did these people pay? And how can we prevent children from suffering the same fate in the future? Teach Like a Champion 3.0: 63 Techniques That Put Students on the Path to College by Doug Lemov
The third edition of Lemov’s Teach Like a Champion is an “expanded and up-to-date revision” of his original comprehensive overview of more than 60 teaching techniques that set students up for success. Lemov walks teachers through the right ways to phrase and ask questions, how to check for understanding, the best ways to motivate and encourage active participation, how to ensure that students retain material, and more. Readers particularly enjoy the over 100 accompanying videos found online, which showcase actual teachers implementing Lemov’s strategies in their classrooms. The Knowledge Gap: The Hidden Cause of America’s Broken Education System—and How to Fix It by Natalie Wexler
Education journalist Wexler embarks on a thoughtful and thorough trek through history and research, arriving at an in-depth critique of skills-based literacy curricula. With an eye toward equity, she urges schools to reconsider the ways they teach elementary students of diverse backgrounds to read—and she shares accounts from classrooms where educators are doing just that. Wexler characterizes this book as a criticism not of teachers but of a system that has become strikingly resistant to change. Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom by bell hooks
In this collection of essays on the intersections between education and politics, race, class, and gender, hooks takes ample inspiration from Brazilian educator and philosopher Paulo Freire, whose seminal text also made this list. Rethink the role of the student and teacher, hooks says, by engaging in the deeply vulnerable work of self-reflection and scrutiny. And hooks does this herself, recounting memories of her identity as both student and teacher. One reviewer on Goodreads explains that this isn’t the sort of book you read once and put back on your shelf—instead it reveals itself to you in layers each time you revisit it. Readicide: How Schools Are Killing Reading and What You Can Do About It by Kelly Gallagher
“Readicide,” which Kelly Gallagher defines as “the systematic killing of the love of reading,” is the unintentional outcome of many common teaching strategies. If you want your students to read more and actually enjoy doing so, he suggests taking a good hard look at the practices you employ in your classroom. Are you asking students to read challenging texts without instructional support? Is there space in your classroom for recreational reading, or are only academic texts prioritized? Gallagher provides practical ways to make reading enjoyable for students. Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire
The educational landscape of today is very unlike the one Freire spoke about back in 1968 when this was originally published, but the need for a critical look at our pedagogical systems remains as salient now as it was then. Perspectives on knowledge, access, education reform, and class are heavily colored by Freire’s experiences with poverty in Brazil, as well as his work with marginalized communities—many of whose members could not read. Freire speaks neither of a “sage on the stage” nor a “guide on the side” model, instead articulating one where teachers view themselves as active participants in learning from their students and view their students as sharers of valuable insights to teach. Book Love: Developing Depth, Stamina, and Passion in Adolescent Readers by Penny Kittle
Reluctant readers are an unfortunate reality of any English classroom, no matter the age or grade. So what to do when students simply won’t engage with assigned texts, or even pick up a book for fun? Kittle—a seasoned teacher and literacy coach—shares a mixture of inspirational and personal anecdotes balanced with clear and concise strategies to help start students on their personal reading journey. Whether you’re trying to build an engaging classroom library or revamping your instructional efforts to better support struggling readers, Book Love will breathe new life into your practice. The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life by Parker Palmer
As you develop your unique teacher identity—who you are and how that relates to being an educator—Palmer walks the same philosophical path. Reflecting on his own time teaching, Palmer doesn’t focus just on the motivational “heart” side of the work; he also explores ways to safeguard against burnout, demonstrates the importance of fostering connections with students, and explains why “good teaching cannot be reduced to technique alone.” The advice may be, as some reviewers on Goodreads claim, abstract rather than immediately actionable, but it could be a dose of encouragement just when you need it."," You don’t say, ‘Well, I fell trying this new skill, so I guess I’m not meant to do gymnastics.’ It’s important to help students embrace that and embrace the learning journey.” This is also true for educators—especially new teachers. Over 100 titles were suggested—including some that surprised and delighted us, like educator Lily Crull’s comment on Instagram that she reads “at least 5–6 new” young adult books that her students recommend each year. Classics like Harry and Rosemary Wong’s bestseller The First Days of School made an appearance, while some more recently published titles were heavily nominated as well: Bettina Love’s 2023 offering Punished for Dreaming easily made it into our final list."

NPR tried to answer that question, looking at a couple of studies. The first, which was conducted in 1964, tricked teachers into thinking some students were more likely to succeed. In turn, those students improved more than others. But why? The research found that students expected to succeed were treated differently, often in minute ways. Another more recent study also looked at how those expectations can change and suggested seven ways teachers can adjust classroom expectations.

Perhaps ChatGPT’s biggest time feature is that it can generate text for materials and handouts that target your specific instructional needs. It can do the following:  Need a choice board for an art activity? Boom, done. Ask ChatGPT to create a passage, chapter, or book summary for students who need support. The tool can also function as a text compactor that analyzes readings and creates more concise and condensed versions. Furthermore, the AI will generate differentiated rubrics for an assignment so that each heuristic emphasizes customized expectations and levels of challenge. Using ChatGPT, teachers can streamline communication with parents, colleagues, and administrators via AI-composed welcome-to-class letters, newsletter copy, volunteer and donation requests, supply lists, grant and field trip proposals, assembly programs, and permission sheets. With careful oversight, teachers can use ChatGPT to quickly create a variety of assessment materials.

Erroneous and polished bloviation pops up in human communication as well. Nevertheless, we must check all AI-produced information for accuracy and usefulness before it reaches students. The chatbot’s prose represents another shortcoming. Without clear directions from the user, it comes off as canned, like it was written by an algorithm, when a prerequisite for uplifting, informing, and empowering students and school stakeholders is correspondence that sounds like you, not Wikipedia.

304,Education,The Overlooked Qualities That Signal Future Success—and How to Nurture Them,https://www.edutopia.org/article/the-overlooked-skills-that-signal-future-success-and-how-to-nurture-them,"https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Adam-3-final-small.jpg?resize=220,150.92000000000002&quality=85","February 23, 2024",Bestselling author and psychologist Adam Grant on rethinking grade point averages and how we misjudge what drives potential.,"A massive upset took place at the 1991 National Junior High Chess Championships. Dalton, a ritzy private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, was defeated by the Raging Rooks, a scrappy team from Harlem. “Unlike their adversaries,” writes Adam Grant, the Raging Rooks “didn’t have a decade of training or years of competition under their belts. Some of them had only learned the game in sixth grade.” How did they exceed expectations? The Raging Rooks won against the defending champions because they had a coach who was skilled at spotting “potential where others had missed it,” Grant says, and who knew how to identify and nurture powerful character traits in his students.   In his latest book, Hidden Potential: The Science of Achieving Greater Things, Grant takes on the enduring myth that “greatness is mostly born—not made.” Leaning on cutting-edge social science and economic research, as well as case studies of artists, athletes, and public figures, he argues that there are millions of overlooked students—much like the Raging Rooks—and for the most part, we’re going about the business of motivating them to reach their potential all wrong. Debunking the narrative that early academic prowess is the sole predictor of future success, Grant points instead to important intangible qualities that are vital for future career success—dispositions like discipline and determination and being proactive and prosocial. Developing these skills, he says, can’t happen in a vacuum. “You need the opportunity and motivation to nurture them.” Schools, for example, should be infusing play into the school day, challenging students to push through academic struggle and discomfort, and rethinking grading practices so they highlight not just performance but growth over time.  Grant, a Wharton professor of psychology and noted New York Times opinion columnist, is the author of influential bestsellers such as Think Again, Originals, and Option B, which he coauthored with Sheryl Sandberg. His books have sold millions of copies and have been translated into 35 languages, and his popular TED Talks have been viewed more than 30 million times.  Sign up for our newest newsletter, The Wired Classroom, and get time-saving tech tips from educators just like you. In our discussion, Grant identified some of the constraints and misconceptions that prevent schools from implementing the best evidence-based practices and suggested steps that educators can take to cultivate kids’ potential in significant ways.  ANDREW BORYGA: Why do you think we’re missing so many kids with potential?  ADAM GRANT: Teachers are crunched for time and have a tremendous amount of pressure on them. They have tests and many other core responsibilities to fulfill.  Tapping into hidden potential requires getting to know students beyond the classroom, and teachers rarely have the time, space, and freedom to do that. In a landmark study, Benjamin Bloom looked at world-class artists, scientists, athletes, and musicians and found that in many cases, their early teachers and coaches didn’t see their potential. That’s because, in part, they only get a sliver of access to somebody’s capacity. If you only have a kid in one art class, for example, you don’t know that they have a real flair for sculpting.  Another issue is that we tend to misjudge what drives potential. We tend to think, almost entirely, about natural talent. We think the kids who stand out from the start are the ones who will reach the greatest heights. But motivation is a bigger factor in growth than raw ability. Unfortunately, the tools teachers have at their disposal assess talent and ability better than they assess motivation or some of the other character skills I write about in the book.  BORYGA: Certain “character skills,” according to research by Raj Chetty and colleagues that you examine in the book, are more important to future success than early math or reading skills. What are some of those intangible skills, and why are they so valuable?  GRANT: In the data, there are character skills that are as much as 2.4 times more accurate than math and reading standardized test scores at predicting adult income. These skills include being disciplined and determined and being focused and able to persist in the face of obstacles. Another important skill is being proactive about seeking out new knowledge as opposed to just reacting to what’s presented.  One of the most underappreciated character skills is being prosocial—forging strong relationships with peers and trying to help your peers learn. A lot of people think a good way to learn something is to seek out someone who is more knowledgeable than you and soak up all of their expertise. That’s not a bad strategy. But research makes the case that you’ll tap into deeper learning if you find someone who knows less than you and teach them what you’ve already learned. Teachers inherently recognize the best way to learn something is to teach it because you understand it better once you’ve explained it. One way to build a character skill like being prosocial is to implement a jigsaw classroom, where you give students a common problem to solve or a project to do and make them each responsible for mastering a segment of the material and teaching it to the rest of the group.  If you teach kids to be interested in sharing what they’ve learned and create a classroom environment dedicated to every student enriching the knowledge of others, that’s just as good for the students doing the teaching as it is for the students doing the learning. BORYGA: A lot of educators, understandably, want to avoid putting kids in uncomfortable situations. Why is it so important to “embrace, seek, and amplify discomfort” for learners, as you say? GRANT: Lots of teachers have been taught that kids have different learning styles—that some are more visual, others are more verbal, others are more auditory. The idea is to replace one-size-fits-all education with something that’s tailored to each student’s style. The problem is we have decades of evidence which shows that while students may have a way that they like to learn, that style doesn’t predict how well they actually learn.  When something feels uncomfortable for a kid, teachers should recognize that the feeling of struggle is usually a sign students are in a position to grow. We should be challenging kids to stretch beyond their strengths and learn in ways that make them uncomfortable. Not only will that propel student growth, it will teach them not to take discomfort as a signal that they’re not naturally good at something.  BORYGA: Speaking of discomfort, civil dialogue and debate are clearly in decline. What role does disagreement play in the learning process, and why is it important for students to engage in civil debate over important issues and concepts? GRANT: Most of us fall victim to what psychologists call the bias blind spot, which is to believe that other people are biased but that you’re objective. It’s the mother of all biases. Because if you don’t even recognize that you have biases, you can’t anticipate and correct them.  But other people can see your blind spots, and when you debate them, they can challenge you to sharpen your reasoning. Debate also fuels creativity. You don’t learn by affirming your beliefs. You learn by evolving your beliefs, and that happens when you confront people who believe different things.  Unfortunately, we’re living in a world where a lot of students are argument illiterate. A big part of education is learning to reason through ideas that are not intuitive to you. If classrooms are only designed for people to build on each other’s ideas and work toward a consensus, students don’t learn the skills of questioning their assumptions or rethinking their opinions.  BORYGA: How can teachers apply some of these insights in the classroom?  GRANT: Research shows that highly creative kids are less likely to be the teacher’s pet in school because they’re poking holes in the teacher’s lesson plan, and they’re arguing with the point teachers are trying to get across. They can be a little bit disruptive and difficult. But what they’re also doing is thinking independently. That defines their creative capacity and also builds their creative muscles.  Often, however, teachers won’t entertain these disagreements in front of the class. I think we should model this in front of the class and make it clear: We don’t agree, but we can still respect and learn from each other’s point of view. What you’re doing there is instead of teaching students what to think, you’re demonstrating how to think and how to disagree. That sets them up to start thinking for themselves. And that means they are more likely to have original ideas moving forward.  BORYGA: You write that perfectionism often stops students from making the progress they have the potential to make. What’s harmful about perfectionism, and what can teachers do about it?  GRANT: Perfectionism wreaks havoc on kids. Perfectionists do get better grades in school, but they don’t do better at work. And that’s in part because perfectionists are at risk of losing the forest in the trees. They focus on small details they can get right and often miss out on the big picture.  In school you can figure out what’s going to be on the test and master all the material. But in the real world, not only do you not know what’s on the test, there isn’t even a test. Perfectionists struggle in that situation. They tend to focus on the things they know they can ace, and that means they end up with a really narrow comfort zone. They’re not trying new things, and they’re constantly beating themselves up for tiny mistakes.  I think the lesson teachers need to instill in students is that you shouldn’t shame your past self, you should try to educate your future self. The value of your mistake is that you’re going to learn how to avoid that mistake and others like it in the future. And that’s a skill. It’s a character skill. It’s one we need to develop early and reinforce often.  BORYGA: Our audience of teachers are always interested in grading practices. You write that traditional grading methods often judge students based on past performance rather than tracking improvements over time. How can schools do a better job of measuring progress?  GRANT: I think the idea of a grade point trajectory, as opposed to a grade point average, is really powerful.  If you look at high school and how performance is a predictor of college success, freshman grades are almost irrelevant. Sophomore grades are a little bit predictive, and junior and senior year grades are much more consequential. But for the most part, we just use the average of all four years and collapse across that.  A student who has a B-plus average, consistently, year over year, is scored the same as one who started out getting B-minuses and ended up with As. But that second student has shown tremendous growth and demonstrates an ability to recover from early failure or struggle. And over time, those are the students we want to invest in because we can see their hidden potential in that trajectory.  We can grade students relative to their starting performance as opposed to just assessing where they land. This would help students, teachers, and parents get a map of what a kid’s progress looks like over time. This could also be a helpful antidote to the tendency to compare yourself to other people. We want students comparing themselves to their past selves more often and to their peers less often. This interview has been edited for brevity, clarity, and flow."," “Unlike their adversaries,” writes Adam Grant, the Raging Rooks “didn’t have a decade of training or years of competition under their belts.

Our teachers were in the same position several weeks ago that U.S. teachers are in now—we were expecting to teach in classrooms in Beijing. Now we’re teaching virtual classes remotely from our homes in China and countries around the world. We had about half a week to prepare for online school, including setting up a digital platform that none of us had ever used before. For the first few weeks, we needed to be very flexible and patient. Everything we would have done in person took longer virtually as we learned to navigate online learning. But we’ve worked out many kinks and are now engaging our students in high-quality learning experiences online. Since our students have stopped physically attending school, their Chinese classes happen in real time following the regular schedule, using a Chinese app. Our international team teaches using Moodle, an open-source learning platform that has the ability to do live video conferencing with digital whiteboards and break-out rooms. We also use it to give students feedback, do partner and group work, and publish class materials—things that can be done through Google Classroom as well. Here is some of what we’ve learned so far about teaching students who must stay home. Start by continuing to use lessons that are clear and simple, and don’t introduce new programs for teachers and students to learn if you can help it. Our international teachers are on four continents across eight time zones, so most of our classes are asynchronous, meaning our teachers post assignments and recorded lessons and students complete work at different times. Teachers respond using a rubric, comments, and sometimes recorded video or audio feedback through our online learning platform. Most of our teachers have at least three live classes each week in addition to the asynchronous classes. This helps build community in the class, engages students, and makes the learning more interactive. Some teachers have found it more effective to teach live classes daily. It’s easy for students to spend a lot of time in front of screens for their online school. As much as possible, we’re assigning students tasks that get them up and moving and away from their devices. We’ve also been working out ways to have students continue to create art without screens. Videos: A first-grade class recently had a homework assignment where students needed to describe a pet. One boy’s mother video recorded him while he used descriptive language to introduce the audience to his two cats. Students can also write and perform plays, or create and cook recipes and conduct interviews, and submit these assignments through video. Workbooks and drawing: Many of our classes at school intentionally used workbooks and paper-based tasks instead of laptops to reduce students’ screen time. We’re continuing this by having students complete some assignments on paper, taking a picture of their completed work, and uploading the photo to submit the task. Similarly, our art classes are continuing to have students work on drawing, and they are taking pictures of their work to submit it to their teacher and share with the class. Subscribe to the Edutopia Weekly newsletter—full of innovative teaching and learning strategies that will work with your students. Get articles recommended for you. In addition to asynchronous and live classes, our teachers all have daily three-hour office hour shifts. They log into Moodle for the duration and are visible as “online” for any student visiting the page. This enables students to contact a teacher for help as they’re doing their schoolwork, and it helps our teachers maintain regular schedules. This resource is comforting to both students and parents as a way to maintain instant communication with the school and teachers in real time. It’s also a way for everyone to feel a little less isolated. Office hours are not for tech support. Early on, we clearly communicated to families how to reach our IT support staff for technical help. We remind families and students regularly—at first we did this daily—who to go to for what types of support. We also have our teachers’ office hours schedules and IT contact information clearly posted on our online learning site. Tech support is vital to your remote learning being successful. Decide as soon as possible who will be responsible for what types of IT support, and how they will be reachable by students, families, and staff. Make sure all of your stakeholders know how to reach out for support. Give teachers, students, and families video and written instructions on how to use your platform so they can answer some of their own questions before reaching out for help. Many students don’t have laptops at home, but in the U.S., most families have access to at least one smartphone that has internet. Fortunately, Google for Education and other online learning platforms typically have good user experiences for smartphones and tablets, in addition to computers. Between having to find childcare and supervise squirmy young learners, remote learning can be a very stressful experience for parents. Proactively and regularly communicate with them in mediums and languages that you know they’ll actively check and understand. Give them clear directions and resources. Solicit, listen to, and act on their feedback. And, as you would with regular school, make sure to reach out to parents with news of great work their children did. Specific work-related praise goes a long way to strengthening relationships with both families and students. At school, our team has weekly professional development sessions. We’ve continued this using our online platform every week with consistent start and end times. Agendas are developed with our instructional leadership team and distributed to teachers in advance. We split our time between continuing to work on our year-long focus of developing our unit plans, modeling how to use our online platform, and answering questions teachers have in real time. In addition to professional development and regular communication, we teachers are working on maintaining our sense of community. We celebrate birthdays and share photos and videos of where we are in the world. There’s even talk of doing virtual yoga classes together. When building digital lessons, it’s helpful to reduce the number of external links on your online learning platform. For example, if you want students to read an article, it’s safer to upload a PDF, rather than a link to an external site that may or may not work. This helps ensure that students are always able to access their digital learning resources. Collaborating: All of our planning materials are shared on Microsoft OneDrive. Like Google Drive, this platform lets us share documents among staff and send students links to documents and folders. Video: We download YouTube and other videos locally to our computer using the free app 4K Video Downloader, and then upload them to OneDrive (you can do this with Google Drive as well). Make sure to download captions. Readings: When assigning students articles from sites like Newsela and CommonLit, we download the articles onto our computer as a PDF and then upload them to OneDrive. This allows us to label files by reading level and have all the resources for a lesson in the same place. Videoconferencing: Moodle has its own video conferencing platform, but Zoom is a very convenient way to have live classes with students—and it is now free for schools. The platform also lets you share your desktop, which is helpful for PowerPoint presentations, reviewing student work with a class, and modeling how to do online research."," Since February 17, I’ve been teaching 11th-grade humanities writing to students who are self-quarantined in China.

Christakis says that we’ve reached a perilous moment for very young kids: Increasingly we treat them as commodities and find ourselves “in danger of losing the child in childhood.” Instead of imposing adult expectations, she argues, parents and teachers should try to “take their blinders off” and see the world through the eyes of young children—a change in perspective that might allow us to better understand and cultivate their unique abilities. I recently had the opportunity to ask her about our evolving cultural values around childhood, what good early educational environments look like, and how we can resist the tendency to “adultify” young children. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Your book on early childhood education is called The Importance of Being Little. Why is “being little” so important? What do you want parents, educators, and policy makers to know about this developmental stage? Traveling around the country, teaching and talking with parents and educators from a variety of backgrounds and environments, has persuaded me that we’re in danger of losing the child in childhood. The notion that there is something of value in being a little kid—with little kid desires and, above all, needs—seems to have fallen out of favor. We talk about young children, increasingly, as commodities to “invest” in for future payoffs. Parents express enormous anxiety about their children’s futures, and seem to be curating their children’s life experiences in a way that would look quite unnatural and even rather joyless to previous generations. There’s a weird paradox that early childhood is both safe and stressful. On the one hand, for most children, especially in the industrialized world, the early years are safer than they’ve ever been in human history. Children have fewer fatal accidents and debilitating diseases. We don’t send children down coal mines to work. Of course there is poverty, stress, and trauma—and some of these problems affect very large numbers of children—but in general terms, many of the big ‘killers’ of childhood have been vanquished. On the other hand, 21st-century American society poses many challenges for young children too. Technology is not always a friend to the young, and there are new and troubling stresses. We have an actual epidemic of preschool expulsions, for example (which disproportionately affect children of color and boys), and increasing numbers of kids with mental health and behavioral challenges. “Being little” is of critical importance because we see the signature of early childhood experience literally in people’s bodies: their life expectancies are longer and their social-emotional capabilities are more robust when they have a chance to learn through play and through deep relationships, and when their developing brains are given the chance to grow in a nurturing, language-rich, and relatively unhurried environment. It’s clearer than ever before that young children are not simply mini-adults. Get our new newsletter, The Research Is In—a monthly roundup of the most impactful education research, translated into actionable classroom strategies. Right, and you use the term “adultification” in your writing. How do you define adultification, and what does it reveal about how we think about childhood? Adultification is the failure to see the world from a child’s perspective. I sometimes ask teachers to get down on the floor of their classroom and just look around from the height of a 4-year-old, or try to put on a snowsuit with the motor abilities of a young child. It’s eye-opening to reflect on the many ways that adults inflict adult pacing, adult expectations, and adult schedules on young kids. And for what reason? Young children sleep less and have far more transitions in their days than in previous generations—and I think most educators and parents would agree that their developing brains aren’t really designed to cope with adult schedules and pacing. We all basically know this is a problem, but it’s hard to break the cycle. We need to step back and see the world from a child’s point of view. We see their development through an adult’s eyes, imagining that we couldn’t possibly learn anything from an hour digging in a container of mud, so it must be time to whip out the math worksheet! It boggles the mind how little outdoor time and gross motor play many young children have in their days. Some of this adultification comes from an inattention to what makes little kids tick and a profound lack of faith in what young children are capable of. What does high-quality early education look like? If you walked into a preschool that uses best practices, what would you see and hear? Quality education is about relationships. Caring teachers who understand child development and who know and are attuned to the children in their care are far more important than many of the measures of quality we use today, such as class size, physical environments, or a specific curriculum. Rich, open-ended conversation is critical, and children need time in the day to experience warm, empathic oral language—to converse with each other playfully, to tell a rambling story to an adult, to listen to high-quality literature and ask meaningful questions. The research shows that quality caregivers know both the broad parameters of child development (“This is what a 3-year-old looks like”) and know their children as individuals (“This is what this child is like”). But it’s crucial to keep in mind that intentional, attuned teaching is the opposite of a free-for-all where children are running the show. Quality preschool teachers are intentional about everything they do: the classroom routines, the physical environment, the schedule, the types of materials they make available for children to explore and manipulate. These teachers do an extraordinary amount of observation and reflection—and it’s really almost impossible to do that in a vacuum: the best preschools have collegial, inquiry-based cultures so that they can continually experiment with and modify their learning environments to take advantage of children’s natural curiosity. This is especially true for the many young children who have backgrounds of trauma and adverse childhood experiences. If a child walks in the door not having had anything to eat the night before—or maybe they are processing something positive, like welcoming a new sibling or a grandparent—the high-quality preschool classroom will have a mechanism to respond to those experiences and to channel them into cognitive and social-emotional growth. Educators in these environments take as a starting point that children are fully capable of learning, and they refuse to let school or state mandates dictate how children learn. You write a lot about the importance of play. How do you define play, and why is it so crucial? Play is the defining feature of mammalian development: the impulse is hardwired into us and can’t be suppressed. However, it’s crucial that we recognize that while the play impulse is one thing, the play know-how—the nuts and bolts of playing—is not always so natural, and requires careful cultivation. We’re seeing more dysfunctional play in modern industrialized societies. Children don’t play as much in mixed-age groups, where younger kids can learn from older ones, and the older children in turn have to learn to be gentle and fair with their littlest players. Children have less free time to mess around and make their own rules. They need the time and space to learn how to play effectively, and they require a culture that values play. Increasingly, we don’t seem to have that kind of early childhood culture. So if you suddenly tell a child to “go make a fort out of a cardboard box” when they haven’t had a steady diet of free, unstructured time and access to open-ended materials, well, you will see a cranky and possibly incredulous child. You’ve said, “The authentic early childhood curriculum isn’t necessarily contained in the word we reflexively call ‘preschool.’ It doesn’t need to be in a school at all.” Would you explain what you mean by that? Anyone who has seen the wonder on a child’s face when they see a butterfly landing on a flower understands that learning goes far beyond a classroom. The good news is that children are wired with the capacity for learning in almost any setting. With the loving support of responsive adults, they can learn without the bells and whistles of what we call preschool. So much learning comes about naturally from what scientists call the serve-and-return style of communication between an adult and young child, which others have referred to as a conversational “duet.” There’s a lot of evidence that we can close some of the gaps between lower-income children’s academic trajectories and those of higher-income families by coaching parents and educators to use this approach in their everyday interactions with children. I often coach teachers to ask open-ended questions such as “Tell me about your drawing,” rather than “checking” questions like “What color is the apple?” or “What are you drawing?” The open-ended response really opens up a huge space for spontaneous and deep learning."," Christakis says that we’ve reached a perilous moment for very young kids: Increasingly we treat them as commodities and find ourselves “in danger of losing the child in childhood.” Instead of imposing adult expectations, she argues, parents and teachers should try to “take their blinders off” and see the world through the eyes of young children—a change in perspective that might allow us to better understand and cultivate their unique abilities. I recently had the opportunity to ask her about our evolving cultural values around childhood, what good early educational environments look like, and how we can resist the tendency to “adultify” young children. Traveling around the country, teaching and talking with parents and educators from a variety of backgrounds and environments, has persuaded me that we’re in danger of losing the child in childhood."

For many educators, technology has driven it toward extinction—and it’s time to get serious about reclaiming it.","Technology is compromising the health and well-being of teachers, blurring the already-indistinct boundaries between work and home and leading to an unsustainable “always on” mentality, researchers assert in a new study. It’s not an entirely new problem. For decades, educators have labored under the twin pressures of expanding responsibilities at work and increasing domestic demands. As dual-income families became the norm, larger class sizes, more paperwork, and a gradual shift in caretaking duties toward school systems have strained the capacity of educators, encroaching on personal time traditionally set aside for family and friends. Well before the pandemic, stress topped the list of reasons teachers quit, according to a RAND study, which identified long hours and the burden of taking on second jobs to supplement income as primary factors in early retirement.  Get a first look at our new newsletter—a monthly roundup of education research curated by our editors, and presented in a way that’s clear, concise, and practical. Technology is rapidly pushing things toward a breaking point. The proliferation of computers, and especially cell phones, is putting the last vestiges of personal space at risk, compelling teachers to spend more time outside of school hours planning tech-enriched lessons while responding to nighttime emails and text messages. This pattern of incursion—researchers call it “techno-invasion” or “pervasive connectivity”—can make them feel as though they’re on call at all hours of the day and even late into the night, explains Caroline Murphy, a researcher at the Kemmy Business School at the University of Limerick, in the current study.  For teachers, there are few places to turn to for respite. While the public sector has typically traded lower wages for better work-life balance, the commodification of teaching—driven by a greater focus on test scores and evaluating teacher performance—has led to what some experts call the “marketization of education.” Increasingly, the profession looks like the private sector, “in particular in relation to demands around working time, and the development of an ‘always on’ culture,” Murphy points out. In what amounts to a broken promise, the expectations keep growing, but the pay hasn’t kept pace.  Without new policies defending teachers’ fundamental right to disconnect—to reclaim time with their families and friends, and to relax and restore themselves—the outcomes are all too predictable. Rising job dissatisfaction and deteriorating mental and physical health are real risks, according to the research. The issue is serious and growing, and it demands immediate attention. Online communications have led to a pervasive “encroachment of work on individuals’ time off through ubiquitous connectivity,” says Murphy. The mere expectation that an email or text may arrive from a principal or student, and demand a response, is an intrusion into a teacher’s personal space. Theoretical emails eventually become real ones. The average teacher receives up to 100 emails each day, a staggering amount that can feel insurmountable—and the pressure to reply quickly can feel irresistible. In a 2019 study, employees reported that they started responding to emails 6 seconds after receiving them. Meanwhile, in a 2015 study, researchers observed that employees experienced “significantly lower daily stress” when limiting the frequency of checking email to three times a day, compared with those who had no restrictions.  There’s also a significant cognitive tax to checking emails and other notifications, like texts or reminders: According to a 2017 study, the barrage of pings and warnings emanating from our phones are almost impossible to ignore, even when the phone is off and turned upside down on the table. “The mere presence of one’s own smartphone may occupy limited-capacity cognitive resources,” the researchers conclude, “thereby leaving fewer resources available for other tasks and undercutting cognitive performance.” Shutting the cell phone off and abandoning it in another room was the only way to restore sanity.  The deluge of new technologies unsupported by adequate training—from learning management systems to new apps, videoconferencing software, and multimedia lesson-planning—is undermining competence and professionalism, Murphy argues. “I have NEVER been this exhausted,” exclaimed Sarah Gross, a veteran high school English teacher who did hybrid teaching last fall, according to the New York Times. “This is not sustainable.” Gross isn’t alone: In 2021, researchers analyzed over a decade’s worth of studies and found that teachers were being pushed to adopt technology in their classrooms without the “technical resources and equipment necessary for its correct didactic use,” a particularly insidious problem that culminated in “conflicts between teachers, as well as in their relationships with colleagues or with other people involved in the environment, eventually producing, in the worst case, damaged personal and interpersonal relationships that affect their health.” In a study published earlier this year, researchers found that nearly half of the teachers surveyed spent 20 or more hours per week creating new lessons, adapting materials to online classrooms, and troubleshooting tech issues. Notably, this pattern is expected to continue past the pandemic as schools commit to deeper integration of technology and even offer some form of remote instruction permanently. This new source of anxiety is not only linked to decreased job satisfaction, motivation, and competency but is also a health and safety concern, “causing physical ailments such as headaches, sleep issues, muscle cramps, back aches and high blood pressure,” according to Murphy.  It’s not technology itself that’s the problem—it’s that technology erodes the boundaries that have historically constrained altruistic teachers. “We may feel that if we don’t get a task done, our students will suffer or programs will fail,” explains John McCarthy, a former teacher and current consultant. “However, if we become mentally exhausted, overtired, or drained of energy, we risk a complete shutdown mentally or physically—and at that point, no tasks will get done.” According to a 2015 survey, 78 percent of teachers feel physically and emotionally exhausted at the end of the day, and while technology isn’t the sole source of stress, it is “one of the most significant contributing factors to increasing stress levels,” Murphy points out, adding that educators routinely report that “invasion of privacy” is a “significant source of work exhaustion.” That’s not to say that Ludditical solutions like banning technology should be pursued; technology creates enormous efficiencies and is here to stay, but it must be carefully managed. Murphy asserts that we need to establish and adopt policy that “supports the healthy adoption of technology outside of school hours by both teachers and students.” While the United States is lagging behind other countries, “right to disconnect” legislation has been proposed in New York to protect workers from being penalized if they choose not to respond to emails after work hours. Meanwhile, major companies have begun to acknowledge the problem. Volkswagen banned internal emails from being sent or received through its servers during off-work hours in 2012, following “complaints that staff’s work and home lives were becoming blurred.” And in 2016, France adopted new labor laws giving employees the right “to not have to take calls or read emails related to work during their time off.” The law’s stated goal is to “ensure that the employees’ non-work hours, vacation time, and personal and family life be respected.” So what should be under consideration for schools?"," Technology is compromising the health and well-being of teachers, blurring the already-indistinct boundaries between work and home and leading to an unsustainable “always on” mentality, researchers assert in a new study.

308,Education,"Schools Are Opening Worldwide, Providing a Model for the U.S.",https://www.edutopia.org/article/schools-are-opening-worldwide-providing-model-us,"https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Getty-1211656925.jpg?resize=220,150.92000000000002&quality=85","May 8, 2020",Children are returning to school in countries that are weeks—or months—ahead of the U.S. in battling Covid-19. Here’s how it’s happening.,"Yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report setting out guidelines for opening child-care programs, day camps, and K-12 schools—or the report leaked, depending on who you read. 

The guidelines break school reopening into three phases—each with incrementally more relaxed rules, if infection rates are sufficiently low—but the big picture provides some good news: the recommendations reveal a path forward for schools to reopen, albeit with restrictions. 

High-touch surfaces, toys, drinking fountains, and school buses should be cleaned frequently, the CDC says; playgrounds and cafeterias should be closed or used in staggered shifts; field trips should be canceled; health screenings and body temperature checks for adults and students upon arrival should be considered; cloth masks should be mandatory for staff; and good air circulation throughout the school should be a priority. If someone in the building is later confirmed to be sick with Covid-19, the CDC writes, you might consider closing the school for one or two days to allow for cleaning. Already a few U.S. states with low case and fatality rates—Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming—have quietly announced reopening dates for some schools or school populations this year (students with IEPs, for example), though final decisions in Montana, for example, are left up to the local districts. Most of the country’s K-12 schools will remain closed until at least the fall. In parts of Western Europe and Asia, though, where Covid-19 touched down weeks, and in some cases months, earlier than in the U.S., the threat from the virus has gradually diminished—and schools have reopened to welcome students and teachers into classrooms. Reports from major news publications indicate that even with the strict new rules, children and teachers are generally happy to be back, but the reopenings have not been without controversy: In Denmark, some parents have protested, reported Patrick Kinsgley for The New York Times, and in Tel Aviv some teachers have pushed back over health and safety concerns, wrote Steve Hendrix in The Washington Post. A recent article by Business Insider’s Emily Cavanagh peeked inside the equivalent of K-12 schools operating around the world, from Taiwan to Denmark, China, Norway, and Israel, and looked at the common safety precautions in place. We also looked at recent coverage from The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, CNN, NBC, and The New York Times to get a better picture of the state of schools internationally. We’ve been hearing about staggered start times, or alternate day attendance, ever since California Gov. Gavin Newsom broached the topic in mid-April, as reported in the Los Angeles Times.

In Israel, as some schools began to open as the country’s infection rate declined, staggering arrival times has reduced the crowding that often occurs as buildings open, The Washington Post’s Hendrix reported. Other schools are increasing the number of school entry points to cut down on congestion. 

Meanwhile, in Denmark, where many schools have been open since mid-April—it was “the first country in the Western world to reopen its elementary schools since the start of the coronavirus pandemic,” according to The New York Times’s Kingsley—there’s another big change: Parents aren’t allowed in the building. Teachers, students, and parents are subject to temperature scans at the door—and in some countries, several times throughout the day—often from temperature guns that measure heat coming off the body, though there are concerns about the reliability of these devices outside carefully controlled health-care settings. The CDC guidelines recommend that schools develop protocols for isolating and transporting potentially sick adults or students: Schools should “identify an area to separate anyone who exhibits Covid-like symptoms” and set up “procedures for safely transporting anyone sick home or to a health-care facility.” In Shanghai, special isolation rooms have been set aside to separate people suspected of having the virus from everyone else, according to Business Insider’s Cavanagh. Protecting the vulnerable is crucial. In Israel, teachers and other school staff over the age of 65, and anyone with underlying health concerns, are encouraged to stay home, The Washington Post’s Hendrix reported. The CDC mirrors this guidance: “Protect and support staff and students who are at higher risk for severe illness, such as providing options for telework and virtual learning.” Social distancing throughout school is being enforced: In Denmark, Israel, and Norway, desks “are spaced six feet apart, which is the official recommendation for effective social distancing,” noted Cavanagh. Playgrounds, gym classes, school libraries, and even teachers’ lounges are closed in some countries.

Communal lunches are barred, in most cases, which is consistent with CDC guidelines: “If a cafeteria or group dining room is typically used, serve meals in classrooms instead. Serve individually plated meals.” In some schools, students are assigned seats in the cafeteria, which are arranged three feet apart. Buffet-style grazing is out; food is often plated and served individually, to reduce the obvious channels of transmission.

Small groups of students are often kept together for the whole day—social mixing is discouraged—and are sequestered in a single classroom to avoid congregating in hallways. In Denmark, many classes are conducted outdoors or in outdoor tents, where social distancing measures are easier to accommodate, according to CNN, NBC, and others. Many, though not all, schools require masks for adults and students, and hand washing and sanitizing are frequent. “In Denmark, schools have installed handwashing stations outside of the buildings and students have to wash their hands at least once an hour,” Cavanagh writes, while in Norway classrooms, toys, and frequently touched surfaces are now sanitized twice daily. In another safety measure, notes Kingsley about Danish schools: “Tea ladies have the new task of touring the school with disinfectant, cleaning each door handle at least twice during school hours.”

Contributing editor Sarah Gonser provided additional reporting for this article."," High-touch surfaces, toys, drinking fountains, and school buses should be cleaned frequently, the CDC says; playgrounds and cafeterias should be closed or used in staggered shifts; field trips should be canceled; health screenings and body temperature checks for adults and students upon arrival should be considered; cloth masks should be mandatory for staff; and good air circulation throughout the school should be a priority.

With a pandemic disrupting life across the entire globe, teachers scrambled to transform their physical classrooms into virtual—or even hybrid—ones, and researchers slowly began to collect insights into what works, and what doesn’t, in online learning environments around the world. Meanwhile, neuroscientists made a convincing case for keeping handwriting in schools, and after the closure of several coal-fired power plants in Chicago, researchers reported a drop in pediatric emergency room visits and fewer absences in schools, reminding us that questions of educational equity do not begin and end at the schoolhouse door. When students are learning a new language, ask them to act out vocabulary words. It’s fun to unleash a child’s inner thespian, of course, but a 2020 study concluded that it also nearly doubles their ability to remember the words months later. Researchers asked 8-year-old students to listen to words in another language and then use their hands and bodies to mimic the words—spreading their arms and pretending to fly, for example, when learning the German word flugzeug, which means “airplane.” After two months, these young actors were a remarkable 73 percent more likely to remember the new words than students who had listened without accompanying gestures. Researchers discovered similar, if slightly less dramatic, results when students looked at pictures while listening to the corresponding vocabulary.  It’s a simple reminder that if you want students to remember something, encourage them to learn it in a variety of ways—by drawing it, acting it out, or pairing it with relevant images, for example. Get our new newsletter, The Research Is In—a monthly roundup of the most impactful education research, translated into actionable classroom strategies. For most kids, typing just doesn’t cut it. In 2012, brain scans of preliterate children revealed crucial reading circuitry flickering to life when kids hand-printed letters and then tried to read them. The effect largely disappeared when the letters were typed or traced. More recently, in 2020, a team of researchers studied older children—seventh graders—while they handwrote, drew, and typed words, and concluded that handwriting and drawing produced telltale neural tracings indicative of deeper learning. “Whenever self-generated movements are included as a learning strategy, more of the brain gets stimulated,” the researchers explain, before echoing the 2012 study: “It also appears that the movements related to keyboard typing do not activate these networks the same way that drawing and handwriting do.” It would be a mistake to replace typing with handwriting, though. All kids need to develop digital skills, and there’s evidence that technology helps children with dyslexia to overcome obstacles like note taking or illegible handwriting, ultimately freeing them to “use their time for all the things in which they are gifted,” says the Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity. A 2020 study found that ACT test scores, which are often a key factor in college admissions, showed a weak—or even negative—relationship when it came to predicting how successful students would be in college. “There is little evidence that students will have more college success if they work to improve their ACT score,” the researchers explain, and students with very high ACT scores—but indifferent high school grades—often flamed out in college, overmatched by the rigors of a university’s academic schedule. Just last year, the SAT—cousin to the ACT—had a similarly dubious public showing. In a major 2019 study of nearly 50,000 students led by researcher Brian Galla, and including Angela Duckworth, researchers found that high school grades were stronger predictors of four-year-college graduation than SAT scores. The reason? Four-year high school grades, the researchers asserted, are a better indicator of crucial skills like perseverance, time management, and the ability to avoid distractions. It’s most likely those skills, in the end, that keep kids in college. A simple step might help undercut the pernicious effect of grading bias, a new study found: Articulate your standards clearly before you begin grading, and refer to the standards regularly during the assessment process. In 2020, more than 1,500 teachers were recruited and asked to grade a writing sample from a fictional second-grade student. All of the sample stories were identical—but in one set, the student mentions a family member named Dashawn, while the other set references a sibling named Connor. Teachers were 13 percent more likely to give the Connor papers a passing grade, revealing the invisible advantages that many students unknowingly benefit from. When grading criteria are vague, implicit stereotypes can insidiously “fill in the blanks,” explains the study’s author. But when teachers have an explicit set of criteria to evaluate the writing—asking whether the student “provides a well-elaborated recount of an event,” for example—the difference in grades is nearly eliminated. When three coal-fired plants closed in the Chicago area, student absences in nearby schools dropped by 7 percent, a change largely driven by fewer emergency room visits for asthma-related problems. The stunning finding, published in a 2020 study from Duke and Penn State, underscores the role that often-overlooked environmental factors—like air quality, neighborhood crime, and noise pollution—have in keeping our children healthy and ready to learn. At scale, the opportunity cost is staggering: About 2.3 million children in the United States still attend a public elementary or middle school located within 10 kilometers of a coal-fired plant. The study builds on a growing body of research that reminds us that questions of educational equity do not begin and end at the schoolhouse door. What we call an achievement gap is often an equity gap, one that “takes root in the earliest years of children’s lives,” according to a 2017 study. We won’t have equal opportunity in our schools, the researchers admonish, until we are diligent about confronting inequality in our cities, our neighborhoods—and ultimately our own backyards. Some of the most popular study strategies—highlighting passages, rereading notes, and underlining key sentences—are also among the least effective. A 2020 study highlighted a powerful alternative: Get students to generate questions about their learning, and gradually press them to ask more probing questions. In the study, students who studied a topic and then generated their own questions scored an average of 14 percentage points higher on a test than students who used passive strategies like studying their notes and rereading classroom material. Creating questions, the researchers found, not only encouraged students to think more deeply about the topic but also strengthened their ability to remember what they were studying. There are many engaging ways to have students create highly productive questions: When creating a test, you can ask students to submit their own questions, or you can use the Jeopardy! game as a platform for student-created questions. One of the most widely used reading programs was dealt a severe blow when a panel of reading experts concluded that it “would be unlikely to lead to literacy success for all of America’s public schoolchildren.” In the 2020 study, the experts found that the controversial program—called “Units of Study” and developed over the course of four decades by Lucy Calkins at the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project—failed to explicitly and systematically teach young readers how to decode and encode written words, and was thus “in direct opposition to an enormous body of settled research.” The study sounded the death knell for practices that de-emphasize phonics in favor of having children use multiple sources of information—like story events or illustrations—to predict the meaning of unfamiliar words, an approach often associated with “balanced literacy.” In an internal memo obtained by publisher APM, Calkins seemed to concede the point, writing that “aspects of balanced literacy need some ‘rebalancing.’” In 2020, a team at Georgia State University compiled a report on virtual learning best practices. While evidence in the field is ""sparse"" and ""inconsistent,"" the report noted that logistical issues like accessing materials—and not content-specific problems like failures of comprehension—were often among the most significant obstacles to online learning. It wasn’t that students didn’t understand photosynthesis in a virtual setting, in other words—it was that they didn’t find (or simply didn't access) the lesson on photosynthesis at all. That basic insight echoed a 2019 study that highlighted the crucial need to organize virtual classrooms even more intentionally than physical ones. Remote teachers should use a single, dedicated hub for important documents like assignments; simplify communications and reminders by using one channel like email or text; and reduce visual clutter like hard-to-read fonts and unnecessary decorations throughout their virtual spaces. Because the tools are new to everyone, regular feedback on topics like accessibility and ease of use is crucial. Teachers should post simple surveys asking questions like “Have you encountered any technical issues?” and “Can you easily locate your assignments?” to ensure that students experience a smooth-running virtual learning space. Learning how to code more closely resembles learning a language such as Chinese or Spanish than learning math, a 2020 study found—upending the conventional wisdom about what makes a good programmer. In the study, young adults with no programming experience were asked to learn Python, a popular programming language; they then took a series of tests assessing their problem-solving, math, and language skills. The researchers discovered that mathematical skill accounted for only 2 percent of a person’s ability to learn how to code, while language skills were almost nine times more predictive, accounting for 17 percent of learning ability. That’s an important insight because all too often, programming classes require that students pass advanced math courses—a hurdle that needlessly excludes students with untapped promise, the researchers claim. “Content is comprehension,” declared a 2020 Fordham Institute study, sounding a note of defiance as it staked out a position in the ongoing debate over the teaching of intrinsic reading skills versus the teaching of content knowledge. While elementary students spend an enormous amount of time working on skills like “finding the main idea” and “summarizing”—tasks born of the belief that reading is a discrete and trainable ability that transfers seamlessly across content areas—these young readers aren’t experiencing “the additional reading gains that well-intentioned educators hoped for,” the study concluded. So what works? The researchers looked at data from more than 18,000 K–5 students, focusing on the time spent in subject areas like math, social studies, and ELA, and found that “social studies is the only subject with a clear, positive, and statistically significant effect on reading improvement.” In effect, exposing kids to rich content in civics, history, and law appeared to teach reading more effectively than our current methods of teaching reading.

Perhaps defiance is no longer needed: Fordham’s conclusions are rapidly becoming conventional wisdom—and they extend beyond the limited claim of reading social studies texts. According to Natalie Wexler, the author of the well-received 2019 book The Knowledge Gap, content knowledge and reading are intertwined. “Students with more [background] knowledge have a better chance of understanding whatever text they encounter. They’re able to retrieve more information about the topic from long-term memory, leaving more space in working memory for comprehension,” she recently told Edutopia."," Researchers asked 8-year-old students to listen to words in another language and then use their hands and bodies to mimic the words—spreading their arms and pretending to fly, for example, when learning the German word flugzeug, which means “airplane.” After two months, these young actors were a remarkable 73 percent more likely to remember the new words than students who had listened without accompanying gestures. “Whenever self-generated movements are included as a learning strategy, more of the brain gets stimulated,” the researchers explain, before echoing the 2012 study: “It also appears that the movements related to keyboard typing do not activate these networks the same way that drawing and handwriting do.” It would be a mistake to replace typing with handwriting, though."

At the time, psychologists were interested in general intelligence—a person’s ability to solve problems and apply logical reasoning across a wide range of disciplines. Popularized in part by the IQ test, which was originally developed in the early 1900s to assess a child’s ability to “understand, reason, and make judgments,” the idea of general intelligence helped explain why some students seemed to excel at many subjects. Gardner found the concept too limiting. “Most lay and scholarly writings about intelligence focus on a combination of linguistic and logical intelligences. The particular intellectual strengths, I often maintain, of a law professor,” Gardner explains. Having grown up playing piano, Gardner wondered why the arts weren’t included in discussions about intelligence. As a graduate student studying psychology in the 1960s, he felt “struck by the virtual absence of any mention of the arts in the key textbooks.” That doubt planted the seed that grew into Gardner’s big insight: The prevailing idea of a single, monolithic intelligence didn’t match the world he observed. Surely Mozart’s genius was partially, but not fully, explained by an extraordinary musical intelligence. And wasn’t it the case that all people demonstrated a wide range of intellectual capabilities—from linguistic to social to logical—that were often mutually reinforcing, and that ebbed and flowed over time based on a person’s changing interests and efforts? Those hypotheses have largely been confirmed by recent studies from the fields of neuroscience. A 2015 study, for example, upends the centuries-old idea that reading occurs in distinct areas of the brain; scientists have discovered, instead, that language processing “involves all of the regions of the brain, because it involves all cognitive functioning of humans”—not just visual processing but also attention, abstract reasoning, working memory, and predicting, to name a few. And a growing body of evidence has dramatically altered our understanding of brain development, revealing that we continue to grow and change intellectually well into adulthood. But if Gardner’s objective was to broaden and democratize our conception of intelligence—an idea that resonates deeply with teachers—the pull of the old model has been hard to shake. Today, the idea of multiple intelligences is as popular as ever, but it’s starting to look suspiciously like the theory Gardner sought to displace. “It’s true that I write a lot and also that I am misunderstood a lot,” says Gardner, who originally proposed seven distinct intelligences, adding an eighth a decade later. The big mistake: In popular culture, and in our educational system, the theory of multiple intelligences has too often been conflated with learning styles, reducing Gardner’s premise of a multifaceted system back to a single “preferred intelligence”: Students are visual or auditory learners, for example, but never both. We’ve stumbled into the same old trap—we’ve simply traded one intelligence for another. “If people want to talk about ‘an impulsive style’ or ‘a visual learner,’ that’s their prerogative,” Gardner clarifies. “But they should recognize that these labels may be unhelpful, at best, and ill-conceived at worst.” It’s clear that children learn differently—teachers in Edutopia’s audience are adamant on that score—but research shows that when students process and retain information, there is no dominant biological style, and that when teachers try to match instruction to a perceived learning style, the benefits are nonexistent. Still, the idea endures. Get our new newsletter, The Research Is In—a monthly roundup of the most impactful education research, translated into actionable classroom strategies. Over 90 percent of teachers believe that students learn better when they receive information tailored to their preferred learning styles, but that’s a myth, explains Paul Howard-Jones, professor of neuroscience and education at the University of Bristol. “The brain’s interconnectivity makes such an assumption unsound, and reviews of educational literature and controlled laboratory studies fail to support this approach to teaching.” Students are also swayed by the idea. In a study published earlier this year, medical professors Polly Husmann and Valerie O’Loughlin found that many of their students “still hold to the conventional wisdom that learning styles are legitimate,” and often adapt their study strategies to match these learning styles. But after analyzing the test scores of these students, researchers found no improvement. Instead, they found that tried-and-true strategies—such as viewing microscope slides online—worked equally well for all students, whether they considered themselves linguistic or visual learners. The study highlights the value of learning through multiple modalities, which is an effective way to boost memory and understanding. A 2015 study found that students have a deeper conceptual understanding of a lesson when teachers pair lectures with diagrams. And a review spanning three decades of research found that students retain more information when textbooks contain illustrations because the images complement the text. When students use more than one medium to process a lesson, learning is more deeply encoded—and being overly reliant on a perceived dominant learning style is a recipe for learning less effectively. So what should teachers do? Gardner argues that “multiple intelligences should not, in and of itself, be an educational goal.” Instead, here are a few evidence-based dos and don’ts for applying multiple intelligences theory in your classroom. Do: Don’t:"," Popularized in part by the IQ test, which was originally developed in the early 1900s to assess a child’s ability to “understand, reason, and make judgments,” the idea of general intelligence helped explain why some students seemed to excel at many subjects.

Have you had a student who refuses to go to school? How about a student who attends but skips class? Or a student who puts their head on the table when told to work on a task during class? As adults, we may run because we think we can’t handle a situation in what’s known as avoidance, or we may hide because we don’t want to deal with a situation in what psychologists call escape. Students are no different. Avoidance/escape is a key factor in current national concerns about student absenteeism and disengagement. Think about 15-year-old “Avery,” who experiences an upset stomach because of test anxiety. Or 16-year-old “Andres,” who puts his head on the table because of frustration with schoolwork. Avoidance/escape can be helpful in situations perceived as threatening or uncontrollable because it prevents harm and provides immediate (albeit temporary) emotional relief. Imagine 14-year-old “Alisha,” who refuses to go to school because of bullies. Or 17-year-old “Amir,” who skips class because of teachers labeling and calling him a “bad kid.” This emotion regulation strategy becomes unhelpful, however, when used excessively. It increases our belief that we can’t handle the situation or that the situation is beyond our control. Students frequently avoid or escape from completing a task that they don’t like doing, or they avoid interacting with others who have done something that hurt or upset them. As an educator, what can you do when your student uses avoidance/escape in an unhelpful manner? Get our essential newsletter featuring must-read articles on the education topics that matter to you—it’s personalized and delivered every Wednesday. You can encourage students to explore their emotions in situations they tend to avoid or escape from. Research on emotionally based school avoidance looks at children and adolescents who have difficulty attending or engaging in school due to negative emotions. Using a mood meter helps students identify their emotions and their energy levels. Aptly called “Name It to Tame It” by Dr. Daniel Siegel, noticing and labeling emotions that are influencing their mind and body enables students to be more aware of and make better sense of their emotions in different situations. Or, you can be a role model by sharing how your own emotions affect the way you think or act and how you use avoidance/escape at times, too (hint: the piled-up laundry). You can also encourage students to reflect on the helpfulness of avoiding or escaping from emotional situations by asking them, “Is it helpful for you to avoid/escape this situation?” If avoidance/escape is perceived to be helpful to students, you can listen to and understand without judgment the ways in which avoidance/escape is helpful to them. This validates their emotions and normalizes their use of the strategy. You can also prompt students to consider the long-term helpfulness of avoidance/escape by asking them, “Would it be helpful for you in the future to keep avoiding/escaping this situation?” Self-reflection facilitates students’ awareness of avoidance/escape behaviors and insight into the utility of such behaviors. Research reveals that understanding why students choose to not attend or engage in school allows a more proactive and targeted approach to increasing school attendance and engagement. If avoidance/escape is perceived not to be helpful to students, you can support them to add or use other strategies in their emotion regulation toolbox, such as problem-solving, reframing, and/or relaxation, to regulate their emotions. Research shows that enhancing students’ emotion regulation improves school attendance and engagement. Take student disengagement, for example—you can use activities that students enjoy as rewards for engaging in activities they enjoy less (problem-solving strategy based on the Premack principle), shift students’ mindset from “I can’t do it” to “I can’t do it yet” (reframing strategy based on Stanford professor Carol Dweck’s growth mindset), and/or choose a reasonable work interval for students and have a break of laughter yoga or mindfulness coloring after each interval (relaxation strategy based on mind-body medicine). You can also support students to gradually confront situations that they tend to avoid or escape from (but do not involve harm) one at a time in manageable chunks. Remember that it’s OK to start with baby steps. For example, students can start with regular practices of one relaxation technique, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. Research demonstrates that gradual exposure builds students’ tolerance to uncomfortable emotions, challenges their dire imagined reality (or worst-case scenario), and boosts their confidence in handling the situation. Using a growth-mindset staircase, you can track students’ progress in approaching an undesired situation by asking them which step they have reached or will reach today. Note that this may be a slow process requiring much scaffolding and positive reinforcement (such as words of encouragement or verbal praise). By guiding and supporting students to better regulate their emotions in both academic and social situations, we can promote and maintain emotional states that enable them to feel better and do better at school and to be part of the solution to the student attendance and engagement crisis."," Students frequently avoid or escape from completing a task that they don’t like doing, or they avoid interacting with others who have done something that hurt or upset them.

View all partners Quentin Tarantino has reportedly scrapped what was supposed to be his tenth and final feature film, The Movie Critic, deep into pre-production. This decision is one in a long line of cancelled or unproduced projects left by the Hollywood wayside. For every film that makes it to our screens, hundreds if not thousands fail to make it – be it due to financial reasons, personal differences, or just the whims of the creatives involved. The following list offers a snapshot of some of these “shadow” films – and a tantalising glimpse of what might have been. The Barbie movie went through several iterations in the decade before its eventual release as Greta Gerwig’s billion-dollar 2023 behemoth. In a GQ article in 2023, Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody (Juno, Jennifer’s Body) discussed her time on the project, which she joined in 2014. She found it difficult trying to present a modern, feminist version of the character which was still identifiable as Barbie. “I didn’t really have the freedom then to write something that was faithful to the iconography,” Cody explained. “They wanted a girl-boss feminist twist on Barbie, and I couldn’t figure it out because that’s not what Barbie is.” Comedian Amy Schumer was cast as the lead, but left the project citing scheduling difficulties in 2017. Cody left the project the following year, having never completed a full draft of the script. Read more: Greta Gerwig’s Barbie movie is a 'feminist bimbo' classic – and no, that's not an oxymoron Night Skies was conceived shortly after the success of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). In The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made (2001), author David Hughes explains that Night Skies was envisioned as a leaner and meaner film. The initial treatment centred on a family’s farmhouse that is being stalked by malevolent aliens. By 1980, special effects creator Rick Baker was hired by Spielberg to create the extra-terrestrials, but this partnership ended in acrimony. While filming Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Spielberg found himself longing to go back to the “tranquillity” of Close Encounters. He entirely reconfigured the project, instead focusing on a kinder and gentler alien, encountered by a boy yearning for a friend. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was released in 1983, and Night Skies was confined to history as a fascinating “what-if”. Read more: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial at 40 – a deep meditation on loneliness, and Spielberg's most exhilarating film In 2014, long before the release of Disney’s live-action remake of The Little Mermaid in 2023, Sofia Coppola was asked to direct a more faithful adaption of the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale. Developed by Universal and Working Title, Coppola eventually dropped out of the project a year later citing “creative differences”. However, in an interview in 2017, Coppola elaborated on why she left, citing the size of the project as a barrier to her creative control. “For me,” she explained, “when a movie has a really large budget like that, it just becomes more about business, or business becomes a bigger element than art.” This, coupled with the technical difficulties of realising her vision of shooting the film underwater, ultimately sank the project.

Lovecraft’s seminal horror work, At the Mountains of Madness (1931), directed by Guillermo Del Toro, produced by James Cameron, and starring Tom Cruise. What could go wrong? Within a year, however, the project was officially dead at Universal, who had baulked at the US$150 million (£121m) asking price for what would have been an R-rated film (meaning viewers under 17 would require an accompanying parent). Del Toro held out hope that the project could be revived. But the release of Ridley Scott’s Prometheus (2012) and its plot similarities to Mountains – a group of explorers uncovering the secret origins of man with horrifying consequences – ultimately put an end to this ambitious horror adaptation. Batgirl was announced in 2021, with Bad Boys for Life (2020) directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah signing on to direct. The cast included Brendan Fraser and Michael Keaton, alongside Leslie Grace as Batgirl. What sets Batgirl apart from any of the other projects on this list is that the film was in fact completed, and only cancelled deep into its post-production. Originally devised as a straight-to-streaming film for Warner Brothers’ fledgling streaming service HBO Max, a change in ownership and priorities saw the focus on streaming scrapped – with Batgirl paying the price. Warner decided to cancel and take a tax write-down on the US$70million (£56m) film, much to the dismay of many in the industry. The film was locked away, perhaps never to be released.

This includes films, TV shows, documentaries and even reality TV. But the road to get here hasn’t been easy. This is because Indigenous filmmakers, producers and artists have had to navigate the complex and often unfriendly terrain of Canadian media institutions and media production companies. But their negotiations — and struggles — over the past 30 years have helped make space for a new generation of Indigenous media makers now making shows and films on their own terms. These Indigenous creators increasingly have more decision-making power — and more control over how their stories get told as well as the ability to subvert old colonial representations. In a special episode of Don’t Call Me Resilient, recorded on-site with an audience in Vancouver at Iron Dog Books, we speak with Karrmen Crey, an expert on this new Indigenous media world. Crey speaks about the ways Indigenous creators are using humour along with a sharp critique of pop culture to show just how different the world looks when decision-making power over how stories get told shifts and Indigenous media makers take control. Crey, who is Stó:lō from Cheam First Nation, is an associate professor in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C.

View all partners “Tennis is a relationship,” says Tashi Duncan (Zendaya) in director Luca Guadagnino’s new film Challengers. However, this relationship is not simply between the game and the player. Rather the heart of tennis, and perhaps of all competition, is a three-way relationship between two contestants and a third person. Their presence, and observation, is what gives competition its intensity. Challengers fuses sex and sport in a straightforward but effective way. Early on, at a junior tournament, we see friends Art Donaldson (Mike Faist) and Patrick Zweig (Josh O’Connor) fall in lust with tennis’s hot newcomer – Tashi. They’re good, but not great. Meanwhile, she’s all business, demolishing her opponents. The two boys compete for her attention and one night she ends up in their room, where they share a three-way kiss before she leaves. The match in the morning won’t play itself. Patrick wins the film’s first set and he and Tashi get together. Art, however, remains a “good friend”, religiously attending her games even when Patrick doesn’t. When Tashi’s playing career is ruined by an injury, he is there to support her. The two get married and she becomes his coach, the architect of his international success. Meanwhile, Patrick’s career remains in the doldrums, though he and Tashi maintain contact. When Art’s career also hits the buffers, she suggests he play the New Rochelle tennis tournament, at which Patrick will be waiting. What’s the point of all this competition? Tashi and Art are rich, thanks to their sporting success, but it’s clear that wealth doesn’t motivate them – and Art is nonplussed by the fandom that swirls around him. Perhaps it is the pursuit of excellence that drives them. This, however, is clearly not the case for ill-disciplined Patrick, who spends his time in bars and sleeping in his car, despite coming from an inordinately wealthy family. Art too seems ready to give everything up rather than ruthlessly recover his brilliance. Even Tashi, apparently the most dedicated and driven of the trio, is ready to risk professional excellence for an erotic thrill. In his 1903 essay, The Sociology of Competition, philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel argued that competition between two competitors is often aimed at impressing a third party. It is the presence of that third person that gives competition both its meaning and its intensity. Challengers can be viewed as a representation of precisely this three-way dynamic of competition. In the film’s erotic scenes, the desire for Tashi is conditioned by the sexual charge between Art and Patrick. She is attracted to them both at various times. Having apparently “won”, Art remains insecure about his status and the presence of Patrick. The borders between sporting and erotic competition are often blurred. “If you don’t win, I’ll leave you”, Tashi tells Art. Is her incitement to rivalry between the two purely strategic, a means of pushing Art to achieve better performance? It may be. Yet she seems to enjoy the attention of either one when it is on display for the other, be it on the court or in the bedroom. Any tension can only be held so long before one starts to tire, and it is as well that Challengers reaches its stylish pitch when it does. The film ends with a genuine display of affection between two of the characters. This might lead the audience to conclude that an intimate two-way relationship can transcend the competitive urge to perform for another. Yet the very public and performative nature of that moment leaves us wondering whether even reconciliation stems from the need to be wanted, and the desire to impress. Looking for something good?

University of Leeds provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners Warning: this article contains spoilers for Abigail. The horror film Abigail sets out to offer a new and refreshing perspective on the vampire tradition. Gone are the male Draculas of old and the fetishised lesbian vampires of the 2000s that haunted the vampiric horror genre in films like Jennifer’s Body (2009). Instead, the titular Abigail (Alisha Weir) is a young ballerina – the picture of childlike innocence. Child vampires are rare in film, though the commercial success of M3gan (2022), a horror film about an evil AI doll that looks like an eight-year-old girl, proved that monstrous young girls are a marketable film villain. In Abigail, a group of ragtag criminals kidnap a young girl (not knowing that she’s actually a bloodthirsty vampire) and hold her in a mansion in order to each receive a hefty payout. Though she appears to be a child, we soon learn Abigail is centuries old, and has developed a habit for “playing with [her] food” – this is a vampire hellbent on getting what she needs. The cast is stacked with familiar faces, headed by Scream (2022) star Melissa Barrera as recovering drug addict and medic Joey. Other stars include Angus Cloud as Dean, Kathryn Newton as ditsy hacker Sammy, and Dan Stevens as former detective Frank. The ensemble cast works well, adhering to the traditional horror trope of a group of strangers turned allies. Abigail has a lot of potential to offer its audiences: popular horror themes with a fresh twist in its child star. But none of the film’s strengths can outweigh its biggest weakness – its antiquated treatment of women. Between the bloodthirsty young ballerina and a group of criminals (most of whom have no issue harming Abigail even when they think she is a regular young girl) there’s little room to root for anyone. In having no clear protagonist, Abigail could have told an interesting and compelling story. But at a time when women in horror are finally becoming more complex (see so-called “good for her” films such as Midsommar and Ready or Not), Abigail’s treatment of its women characters is frustrating. In her role as Joey, Melissa Barrera continues her reign as a contemporary scream-queen – but she shines despite the writing, not because of it. Joey’s motivations and background are frequently overshadowed by the emphasis and importance placed on her maternal instincts. Joey is the only criminal who objects to hurting Abigail. She also takes the lead when it becomes apparent all is not what it seems. It is established she has a son, who she has abandoned, but her motherly instinct shows in her treatment and comfort of Abigail. Despite being assigned an androgynous nickname earlier in the film, Joey adheres to traditional feminine maternal behaviour. She forms a bond with Abigail, who is revealed to act out because of her absent father in unsuccessful bids for his attention. This supposed atonement for her previous lack of maternal instincts, in abandoning her son, is the reason that Joey is the only member of the criminal group to survive the film. Read more: What makes a film score frightening? Expert explains the techniques that build tension and make us jump Joey’s character adheres to the guidelines of the “final girl” trope (the final heroine left at the end of a horror movie). She remains sexually pure, rejecting the advances of another criminal. She defies gender roles through her nickname and her action-ready nature, leading the pack against Abigail. Yet the film seems to save her because of her feminine instincts and her desire to protect Abigail from harm. Joey being a maternal figure to Abigail isn’t an inherently negative plot point, but her survival hinging on it, and not her strength or mind, inextricably ties her value to her status as would-be mother. She does not save herself, whereas “final girls” generally emerge triumphant because of their determination. Joey gets to live because she cares for others – she has utilitarian purpose in a patriarchal world. When Abigail and Joey team up in the film’s final scenes to kill Frank, who is now a vampire, their success after an extensive fight scene is as close as the film comes to a feminist moment. But just as Abigail decides to let Joey leave, her vampire father (the film’s version of Dracula) arrives. This stunts any progressive female representation by introducing another dominant male figure moments after Frank was killed. Abigail has to beg her father to let Joey live, meaning the women of the film are once again held accountable to a man. Joey fails to take her place among final girls of past, such as Laurie Strode in the Halloween franchise and Sidney Prescott in the Scream series, because she wins her life not by brute force, but by following maternal instincts. I found Joey’s “reward” of life for her conformity to patriarchal ideas of how women should behave tiresome. This is a film that could have taken its place in the horror hall of fame, but instead ties itself up in its references to its classic horror roots, meaning it falls prey to gender standards of old.

Child vampires are rare in film, though the commercial success of M3gan (2022), a horror film about an evil AI doll that looks like an eight-year-old girl, proved that monstrous young girls are a marketable film villain. In Abigail, a group of ragtag criminals kidnap a young girl (not knowing that she’s actually a bloodthirsty vampire) and hold her in a mansion in order to each receive a hefty payout. Though she appears to be a child, we soon learn Abigail is centuries old, and has developed a habit for “playing with [her] food” – this is a vampire hellbent on getting what she needs."

View all partners The Beautiful Game is a film of second chances — where teams of homeless men and women from around the world find that all roads lead to Rome and everything’s to play for. Starring Bill Nighy as coach Mal, it follows the England team as they prepare for the Homelessness World Cup in Rome. At the last minute, Mal decides to bring with them a talented striker Vinny (Michael Ward), who could give them a chance at winning, but only if he’s ready to let go of his past and become part of the team. The Homelessness World Cup is a real football tournament and the film was made by the foundation responsible for the annual games. The idea for Homeless World Cup (HWC) Foundation emerged in 2001. It was created by The Big Issue, a magazine that supports homelessness, co-founder Mel Young and Austrian journalist Harald Schmied with the aim of transforming lives, creating opportunities and changing perceptions of homelessness. To date, HWC has helped 1.2 million homeless people through a network of more than 70 grassroots organisations in more than 70 countries. The Cities Ending Homelessness Report supported by HWC notes that along with interventions around housing, mental health and employment, HWC football is helping to change the narrative from managing the homeless problem to ending homelessness. As someone who has worked with people who have been helped by the tournament, I found the film captured the spirit, commitment and, in part, the remarkable story of the Homelessness World Cup. Last year’s tournament involved 400 players representing 40 countries and took place in Sacramento, California in the US. The teams competed in a week-long football tournament for seven prizes: four for the men’s competition and three for the women’s. The tournament marked 20 years of HWC and was won by Mexico’s women’s team and Chile’s men. An HWC survey found that 94% of players say the foundation has had a positive effect on their lives, 83% improved their relationship with families and friends and 77% say that HWC has changed their lives significantly and 76% continue to enjoy and play the sport. Many of the extras in the film had been helped by HWC. Bill Nighy told the BBCthat the best bit about being in the film was meeting the extras who had participated in the real tournaments and are now no longer homeless. As a sports academic, I have worked with HWC and spoken to many people who they have helped. In a journal article, my colleague Susan Ahrens and I sought to find out to what extent football could increase the capability of the homeless and those living on the street. We did so by focusing on how the Homeless World Cup and Street Soccer (Scotland) have affected the lives of some people. During this research, I spoke to people whose lives had been changed by competing. The stories I heard were about finding hope in sport. As one man told me: “It helped me mentally because I was starting to get depressed but the football and goal of HWC helped me feel more positive.” Others spoke of gaining purpose and control. “I want to feel like I have control in an aspect of my life again … At the moment soccer gives me this.” Many also said that the experience had given them hope for the future. “To me it [HWC] was a symbol of hope, determination, strength, and courage. It was the first time in my life I was proud to say I was an addict in recovery.” Our research found that interventions that start small can make a big difference. Football can contribute to non-football outcomes, such as reducing homelessness and building other skills such as team work and communication. The Beautiful Game echoes our research as it celebrates the power and potential of team sports for those who might feel pushed to the margins. We watch as Vinny refuses to relate to his team mates and to accept his homelessness. Playing as part of a team helps him to open up and be hopeful. Winning is not the real reward of playing in the HWC, it’s the interpersonal skills Vinny learns and the personal development he experiences. The film is a testament to the reach and capability of football as a tool to make a difference that goes beyond the pitch. Looking for something good?

University of East Anglia provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners This article contains spoilers for Sometimes I Think About Dying. Director Rachel Lambert’s sweet and sedate film Sometimes I Think About Dying frames suicidal thoughts as a strategy for survival. In the film, introverted office worker Fran (Daisy Ridley) takes solace in increasingly elaborate, surreal and aesthetic fantasies of her own death, including hanging from a crane, lying dead in the woods and being attacked by a python. But she isn’t seemingly suicidal. Or even depressed. She is isolated and lacking connection, but this seems to stem as much from choice as from social anxiety. Fran doesn’t want to conform to the social expectations she sees her colleagues awkwardly performing in order to fit in. The film begins with the retirement of likeable colleague, Carol (Marcia DeBonis) and pivots with the arrival of her replacement, Robert (Dave Merheje), who has relocated following a divorce. Affable Robert uses gentle humour to fit in to the workplace, but the moment when he reaches out to Fran on the work message board shows that he also seeks a deeper connection. Lambert understands the gendered nature of the pressures we feel and the strategies we adopt to fit in within social and work environments. Men are seemingly accepted more easily than women as being eccentric or laconic, as we see with several of Fran’s colleagues. Soon Fran and Robert go to the cinema and a restaurant for pie, but these don’t feel like dates, just the first steps in a tentative friendship. While Robert struggles to prise information from Fran about who she is and what she likes, the film’s fantasy sequences give us access to the complex and creative inner world into which she escapes in order to feel real. Lambert and Ridley really understand and connect with Fran’s psychology, and reveal it in a way that avoids either pathologising her or reducing her to a quirky indie movie cliche. Having recently completed a book on the historical interactions of psychiatry and cinema, I have watched a lot of films about young women quietly – and sometimes not so quietly – descending into “madness”. In films like Repulsion (1965), Images (1972) and Black Swan (2010), young female characters’ violent experiences of psychosis are exploited by male auteurs to confound and impress audiences and critics. The proliferation and persistence of this cinematic trend prompted the Canadian film critic Kier-La Janisse to class them as a specific “psychotic women” sub-genre. These films typically trigger flurries of psychological think pieces that ask questions such as: “What mental health problem has she really got?”. Lambert’s film is therapeutic rather than diagnostic. She doesn’t want Fran to change. Just to feel as comfortable being herself around other people as she is when she’s alone. The film concludes with Fran sharing her titular secret with Robert, opening up the possibility for understanding, intimacy and connection – for a more real friendship rather than a romance. As the film shows, the need for connection and intimacy is a universal human need rather than an individual mental health issue. As the recently retired Carol explains: “It’s hard being a person.” This is the simple but substantive message of the film. In one scene, Fran goes to buy doughnuts as a gesture of goodwill with the office and as an olive branch to Robert. In the cafe, she bumps into Carol. This is the film’s most poignant moment. Fran asks why Carol isn’t on the dream cruise with her husband that she had long saved for, and had retired to enjoy. Carol’s husband had a debilitating stroke on the eve of their trip, and now she is just waiting to see if he will ever recover. Carol had spent her working life dreaming about living, and this dream has been cruelly curtailed. In the film, dreams of living and dreams of dying are two sides of the same coin. They are alternate strategies for coping in a banal but uncertain world. Ultimately – as in Harold and Maude (1971), an older but similarly unconventional film making the connection between social isolation and thoughts of suicide – the protagonist’s dreams of dying are actually wishes for and a pathway towards connection, acceptance and freedom. Sometimes I Think About Dying concludes with Fran and Robert hugging in the office copy room, which has now been taken over by the forest floor upon which Fran had earlier fantasised about lying dead. Fran’s inner world and external reality have become aligned and alive through her sharing with Robert. The slow camera pan revealing Fran’s merged worlds is accompanied by With a Smile and a Song from Disney’s 1937 animation, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Lambert said the unusual but effective song choice was “found” by accident. It was initially suggested in jest by the editor, but they both then realised that it felt emotionally right. This final act of freeing yourself from expectations and doing what feels right is a fitting ending for this cliche-avoiding film. Looking for something good?

University of Surrey provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners When Amy Winehouse died at the age of 27 in 2011, many felt the world had been robbed of one its greatest stars who had barely shown us the extent of her talent. The new biopic Back to Black – directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and named after Winehouse’s seminal second album – attempts to make sense of her tumultuous life and musical output. The film follows Winehouse – played by Marisa Abela – from the early days of her career in early-2000s London, through to global stardom. In the process, it reveals the ways in which female celebrities are objectified in contemporary media and celebrity culture, even after their death. At the height of Winehouse’s fame, gossip tabloids still ruled the media. They created what became known as “trainwreck celebrities” – predominantly female stars who were portrayed as publicly promiscuous and frequently intoxicated. The most famous from this period include Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and Lily Allen. These female celebrities were regularly shamed in the tabloid and gossip press on both sides of the Atlantic. Winehouse shot to fame with her first album, Frank, in 2003, and was quickly considered one of these “trainwrecks” for being outspoken, performing intoxicated, and stumbling out of north London bars with her on-off lover and future husband, Blake Fielder-Civil. Throughout her life, Winehouse tried to resist this form of control and commodification. She was seen fighting with paparazzi and resisting rehab when her record company tried to get her help (she even wrote a song about it). Abela’s ability to imitate Winehouse’s voice and mannerisms is often impressive. However, while in the early stages Back to Black tries to counteract Winehouse’s tabloid image, it ultimately fails to shift this widely accepted narrative surrounding her chaotic lifestyle. The beginning of the film centres on Winehouse’s songwriting talent and musical performance, which is swiftly followed by the offer of a record contract. Abela’s Winehouse doesn’t tire of reminding her family and the viewer that she’s not in this for the fame or money. Indeed, the film both begins and ends with her telling us that all she wants is to make music that helps people forget their troubles, and only wants to be remembered for being a singer and for being herself. Winehouse’s distinctive personal style is central to the visual storytelling of the film. The singer became known for her trademark beehive and eyeliner, as well as a signature Fred Perry polo and skinny jeans combination. She was also known for wearing pink satin ballet flats, which gained notoriety in paparazzi photos that showed them bloodied in the public aftermath of a fight with her husband in August 2007. The film uses Winehouse’s distinctive style to communicate changes in her health. Instead of showing the unglamorous and often visually disturbing realities of bulimia and drug abuse, the progressively more torn clothes and dishevelled hair come to signify Winehouse’s physical and mental decline. Many of these style moments used in the film were not inspired by looks she wore in her performances, but instead were captured through paparazzi footage. While the use of these visuals amid the dramatised scenes serve as a reminder of the relentless media chase Winehouse had to endure, the film ultimately reinforces this sense of media exploitation. Rather than offering a complex visual portrayal that goes beyond the “trainwreck” images the viewer may be familiar with, Back to Black almost banks on how recognisable they are. It relies on the tabloid media’s damaging visual narrative instead of venturing to create its own. As a biopic, the film attempts to reclaim Winehouse from the victimhood often ascribed to her. However, the story it tells reduces Winehouse’s complex character and her life to a series of episodes of suffering. Take a scene set in the wake of her beloved grandmother’s illness and death. Winehouse’s husband is presented as the villain who exploits her trauma as a moment of weakness, to introduce her to the same hard drugs she rejected early on in the film. This sets Back to Black’s story on a familiar trajectory. In the film, her bulimia happens in the background, with scenes briefly showing Winehouse in front of the toilet. The only somewhat explicit discussion of it appears when her flatmate complains about the flushing noises that wake her up. These brief moments serve as markers of unhappiness, but offer no exploration of where this unhappiness may come from. They eschew the complexity of Winehouse and her mental health, and don’t offer more than the shallow broken artist shaped by tragedy and the love of a bad man – a narrative we already know. When Back to Black does look for causes of unhappiness, it settles on odd territory. At one point, it seems to suggest that her suffering stems from an unfulfilled desire to be a mother – a take that has garnered deserved criticism. Ultimately, Back to Black is unable to capture what made Winehouse so special: the grain of her voice, and her ability to craft stories of female experience that reject simplistic narratives of suffering.

View all partners One track on Taylor Swift’s new album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” honors a long-celebrated, oft-miscast heroine of American feminism: actress Clara Bow. As historians of the 1920s, we’ve studied Bow’s fame and her cultural legacy. At her ranch in rural Nevada, we oversee a collection of her personal artifacts, including her clothing and a makeup case. Bow was a woman way ahead of her time, a star who owned her success and her sexuality. There’s the popular perception that Bow was a victim of her own demons. But her story is anything but a cautionary tale. It is a victory march. Bow’s career got its start in her native New York, where in 1921, at the age of 16, she won a beauty contest and got a bit part in a film as her prize. Bow took every opportunity to be on set and learn the craft. She showed up early, stayed late and studied how to work with the cameras and lights. In a nascent film industry, Bow’s professionalism and graciousness defined her success. After she moved to Hollywood in 1923, Bow’s ability to steal a scene earned her a series of roles as a peppy sidekick in films such as “Dancing Mothers” (1926). The actress’s star turn happened in 1927’s “It,” in which she starred as a department store clerk who tries to woo her boss. Variety went on to dub Bow, who had become known for her trademark pout, flirty eyes and fiery red hair, Hollywood’s “hottest jazz baby.” Off the screen, a string of high-profile romances made her personal life fodder for the gossip pages. In 1926, Photoplay told readers that Clara “plays the reckless younger generation – on and off the screen,” noting that she kissed her boyfriend “so hard that his jaw was ‘sore for two days.’” Bow’s relationship with the press ran hot and cold. But the stories were unremitting. They ranged from studio-sponsored puff pieces in big trade publications to thinly sourced stories about orgies and abortions, published by small-time papers battling it out in Los Angeles’ cutthroat media environment. According to the press, Bow was plagued by “nervous breakdowns,” unlucky at love, and too brash for her own good. Her legions of fans loved her anyway. By 1929, she was receiving 45,000 fan letters a month. That same year, sales of the reddish dye henna tripled as fans tried to mimic her look. On set, she played cards, told rude jokes and doled out generous gifts, including an emerald-encrusted watch that she bestowed on one of her hairdressers. A century before Swift’s “Eras Tour,” Bow’s brand of American femininity – cocksure, adventurous, sexy – had real reach. In his 1981 memoir, producer Budd Schulberg wrote, “Millions of followers wore their hair like Clara’s and pouted like Clara, and danced and smoked and laughed and necked like Clara.” As powerful as Bow was in the late 1920s, she was largely powerless to direct her own career. Time and again, she signed lowball deals from male studio heads who demanded a nonstop production schedule. At the beginning of her career, her bosses at Preferred Pictures loaned her to other studios and pocketed her pay. They imposed rules and codes of conduct in her contracts to hem in her behavior. The demands of work were relentless. Exhausted, Bow told Motion Picture magazine in 1930, “People don’t know the studios are factories, that you get up at seven and work hard all day under uncomfortable conditions. People don’t know it because the studios don’t want them to know it.” Her family mooched. Maids stole. A friend-turned-personal assistant embezzled money and then sold her secrets to the press, sparking a scandal and trial. She had a gambling problem and mental health issues that reporters greedily chronicled. Bow ended up making 58 films in just over a decade. The studios owned her. Then she pulled the ultimate power move. She quit. In the early 1930s, Bow left Hollywood and moved to the Walking Box Ranch in rural Nevada, a 400,000-acre property owned by her husband, cowboy film star Rex Bell. The press was unaware of her whereabouts. Some colleagues wondered if her Brooklyn accent had done her in with the arrival of talkies, or if she had experienced another breakdown. In reality, she had fallen in love. She said of Rex, “He’s given me the only unselfish devotion I have ever had.” Together, they raised two sons. He stayed in Nevada and moved on to a career in politics. Although they never divorced, Bow eventually returned to California, where she spent her later years living quietly in Santa Monica with her black poodle, Angel. She read voraciously, a habit fueled by her lifelong insomnia. She loved to decorate for Christmas. It turns out, Bow was not a victim of her time. She wasn’t pushed out of film because talkies exposed her Brooklyn accent. Nor was she shunned by Hollywood society for the ever more scandalous stories that emerged. She simply left and, for the most part, didn’t look back. As to her reputation as a recluse, her eldest son, Rex Bell Jr., said, “She wasn’t near as reclusive as people thought.” She hid behind scarves and glasses, “hoping people wouldn’t recognize her,” but when they did, “they’d walk up and say, ‘You’re Clara Bow, aren’t you?’” Of his mother’s fame, he remembered, “She was always nice to people. She really was.” Her legacy as a figurehead of American feminism is accurate, if incomplete. Bow came to the fore of American culture at a time when Hollywood’s nascent studio system developed the formula for selling sex. In the late 1920s, the press realized celebrity gossip sold papers, and the personal lives of actors and actresses were fair game. Realizing that any attention is good attention, studio executives embraced the media’s sensational coverage of Bow’s implied abortions or mental health issues. Taylor Swift and Clara Bow have much in common: a meteoric rise to fame built on talent and hard work; a series of closely watched love affairs; and legal drama with managers, former friends and the press. Both women redefined expectations of what an American woman could – and should – be. In 2019, in the midst of a dispute with her former label, Big Machine Records, Swift decided to rerecord her prior records and rebrand them as “Taylor’s Version” in order to regain ownership of her music. There was no “Taylor’s Version” for Bow. But her choice to leave Hollywood ended up being a middle finger to the men whom she had made rich and powerful. Now, Swift is bringing Bow back into the spotlight for an encore – and for a new generation of fans to appreciate.

University of Essex provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners The point-of-view (POV) shot is a filming angle that is usually used to put the viewer into the rigid perspective of how a character sees the world, either for a few scenes, or in some cases, the whole film. Used well, it can be extremely effective, presenting an entirely new way of looking at a character or their motivations. This can be very useful for filmmakers depicting difficult characters, like murderers, machines or monsters. Here are five films that have used POV to depict difficult or inorganic characters in convincing ways. James Cameron’s classic dystopian sci-fi film is about a cold killing machine hunting a woman to win a future war. Viewers learn early into the film that the killer cyborg (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) “can’t be reasoned with” and “doesn’t feel pity, remorse or fear”. At several points, we are shown events through the eyes of the mechanical killer – witnessing the world through its confined lens. A red filter replaces natural colours, while numeric data and targeting systems remind us of the unnatural objectives programmed into this machine. Viewers do not inhabit the cyborg’s gaze for long, but experience it often enough to differentiate between the war on humanity as seen from killer robotic eyes and everybody else’s. Robocop (1987) later took this format and added an element of victimhood to it, using POV to signify a character who had human vulnerability mixed in with their mission as synthetic executioner. Julian Schnabel’s biographical drama about Jean-Dominque Bauby’s experience of locked-in syndrome is a harrowing film of vulnerability told through a single working eye. Bauby wrote his memoir (of the same name) using the only part of his body that he could control, his left eye. Using structured blinking patterns and a complex alphabetical chart, his eye became his only means of communication. Schnabel’s film uses POV to present the extreme discomfort of this condition. Lopsided imagery of medical staff, therapists and loved ones enter our vulnerable and immobile gaze, flooding our field of vision without warning. The camera movement used is ironically more active than most POV films, as shots rapidly scan the room with intermittent blackouts to emphasise blinking and optical hysteria. In one of the most difficult scenes, an operation is carried out on the right eye to seal it shut. A piece of latex covers the lens, making the viewer feel and experience the pain of each stitch. Michael Powell’s darkly controversial film about voyeurism and scopophilia (the pleasure of looking) brought his directorial career to a premature conclusion in 1960. The film’s subjects – sex, trauma and murder – were met with scathing critique from audiences who were not yet ready for such themes, particularly from a director who made more palatable films like The Red Shoes (1948) or A Matter of Life and Death (1946). Peeping Tom opens with a two-minute unbroken POV sequence in which camera-obsessed Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhn) approaches a sex worker while covertly filming her. Following her up to her flat, he murders her with a concealed phallic spike protruding from the camera apparatus. The Freudian message is clear, as too is the challenging way that Powell lambasts viewers for watching. Lewis explains that his obsession is a consequence of his own father (played by Powell) constantly training a camera on him, allowing the killer and victim gaze to overlap. However, the opening sequence is purely killer vision, shown through a viewfinder reminiscent of a hunting rifle, as predator stalks its prey. POV is used in the first third of Delmer Daves’s experimental thriller to tell the story of escaped convict Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart), who is arrested for murder. After Parry’s escape, we learn that he has been framed. In order to clear his name, he undergoes plastic surgery with a sadistic doctor. His vulnerability is emphasised through the use of POV. The doctor looks down on us and cuts the viewer during a POV shot. As Parry’s new identity heals, so the spectator has the opportunity to look at him rather than through him. He is no longer a killer or victim but rather an innocent hero setting forth to clear his name, embodied in the guise of charismatic Bogey. Spike Jonze’s experimental film adopts POV scenes to give viewers a unique way to experience everyday life as a passenger inside the head of an unsuspecting John Malkovich. Awkward puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) discovers a portal to Malkovich’s subjectivity and hacks in permanently to make up for his own shortcomings in his failed life. POV is used to emphasise Schwartz’s awkwardness, which is a recognisable trait within other films and television programmes. The sitcom Peep Show (2003-15) frequently incorporated this shot style into early episodes, to show the awkward perspectives of its two misfits, Jeremy (Robert Webb) and Mark (David Mitchell). And Mike Nichols’s The Graduate (1967) uses an extensive POV shot during a pool scene from anxious protagonist Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) to emphasise his sense of isolation. The final scene of Jonze’s film, also at a swimming pool, is hauntingly reminiscent of Braddock’s alienation as Schwartz is left trapped and forlorn, imprisoned in a POV gaze that he can no longer control.

Viewers learn early into the film that the killer cyborg (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) “can’t be reasoned with” and “doesn’t feel pity, remorse or fear”. Viewers do not inhabit the cyborg’s gaze for long, but experience it often enough to differentiate between the war on humanity as seen from killer robotic eyes and everybody else’s. Robocop (1987) later took this format and added an element of victimhood to it, using POV to signify a character who had human vulnerability mixed in with their mission as synthetic executioner."

She has previously received research funding from NIHR.  King's College London provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Content warning: this article discusses mental health, addiction and eating disorders. Back to Black is a new biopic about the life of musician Amy Winehouse. It covers the time from when she gets her record deal aged 18, until her tragic death from alcohol poisoning in 2011 at the age of 27. Ahead of the film’s release, reactions to promotional material suggested the critical response could be mixed. This was borne out in early reviews, which ranged from resoundingly positive to somewhat scathing. Others have and will discuss the filmmaking, musical performances and storytelling, or compare Back to Black’s retelling against existing accounts of Winehouse’s life. As someone who researches alcohol and its effects, I was interested in how Winehouse’s addiction to alcohol and other substances would be portrayed. Winehouse died in 2011 of alcohol poisoning and an inquest into her death found that she had a blood alcohol level of 0.416. This level of intoxication is life threatening, and is associated with loss of consciousness and suppression of vital life functions. The film focuses on Winehouse’s (Marisa Abela) relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil (Jack O'Connell). His substance use is first shown in opposition to Winehouse’s (him: “cokehead”, her: “drinker”), but their behaviour come to mirror each other. Fielder-Civil talks about “toxic codependence” in one scene, when Winehouse visits him in prison. More striking than the codependency, though, is the lack of agency Winehouse seems to have despite her talent and success. In her relationships with Fielder-Civil and her father (Eddie Marsan) she is almost deferential. Her manager and label hold power over her career. But most shocking of all is how normal life is made impossible by the intrusiveness of the paparazzi. Alcohol is present in the film from the first scene, a family party that introduces us to Winehouse’s close relationship with her nan, Cynthia (Lesley Manville). Before it becomes an overt part of the storyline, viewers are given clues about Winehouse’s relationship with alcohol. She is shown drinking neat vodka in a pub with her soon-to-be manager, drinking a murky-looking “Rickstasy” (Southern Comfort, vodka, Bailey’s and banana liqueur) cocktail alone the day she meets Blake Fielder-Civil for the first time. In one scene she tells her nan that she’d had “a couple of drinks” for courage before appearing on the Jonathan Ross show. Less clearly signposted, however, are her concurrent mental health problems. It is well documented that Winehouse experienced mental health difficulties including depression and bulimia. There is a strong link between substance use and mental health problems and they often coexist. The filmmakers’ choice not to show Winehouse’s other mental health problems too heavily is arguably a fair one, as the director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, has said she wanted the film to “joyfully honour” Winehouse. But the result is that Winehouse’s relationship with alcohol and other substances lacks nuance on the screen. There is extensive research on how social stressors, parental conflict, interpersonal trauma and complicated grief are related to substance use. Viewers are reminded of what Winehouse has lost or does not have (her parents’ marriage, Fielder-Civil, her nan, a baby), in ways that validate the notion of “drinking to cope” or self-medication. Most of us understand the idea of self-medicating intuitively. But depictions of it on screen should not be too simplistic. Research into post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol use disorder found there was a lack of good evidence for the self-medication model. Alcohol use and mental health also have relationships that go in both directions, with evidence that mental health drives alcohol use and vice versa. Towards the end of the film, Winehouse’s request to go to rehab comes as a rapid acceleration through the psychologists’ classic “stages of change” theory of behaviour, which claims that people move through six stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance and termination. We see little of her time in rehab, and while we later get a sense of the chronic and relapsing nature of addiction, viewers are left to fill in the blanks at the end. On the whole, while Back to Black succeeds in avoiding harmful and stigmatising representations of addiction and mental health problems, viewers don’t get a deep insight into the realities and complexities of addiction.

University College Cork provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners In March 2024, Japanese film fans celebrated what would have been the 100th birthday of one of Japan’s most popular female film stars, Hideko Takamine (1924-2010). Many of Takamine’s roles captured the essence of 20th-century Japanese society in flux, challenging and redefining what it means to be a woman through the decades. Her performances are like time capsules, offering insights into the changing roles and expectations of women in a rapidly evolving Japan. They are compelling portraits by an artist whose work was closely linked to the upheavals of the 20th century. These six films – some well-known, some more obscure – highlight the richness of her career, which spanned 50 years and more than 180 films. In a fascinating blend of grit and optimism, this film showcases the complications of life in Tokyo just after the end of the second world war. As a tomboyish aspiring artist in dungarees, Takamine represents a new idea of Japanese women exploring creative freedom after the war. Through her decision to abandon her beloved canvas and paints, joining a musical troupe that toured the cafés and night clubs of Tokyo’s Ginza district, the film symbolises Takamine’s own journey. In this reborn Japan, her bold act of taking agency carved out her place as an artist. As an early post-war example of media-mix marketing, a record of Takamine singing the catchy title song was released at the same time. The film marks a significant milestone in Takamine finding her voice in postwar Japan. Takamine takes the starring role in Japan’s first colour film. With vibrant dance scenes, Takamine questions traditional gender norms in her role as a striptease dancer. Navigating the contradictory expectations and ideas of womanhood, her performance masterfully encapsulates the cultural and moral dilemmas faced by Japanese women during the postwar era. Striptease in Japan was widely tolerated and even supported by the American occupation forces and is sometimes discussed as a marker of female freedom. But when Takamine’s character returns to her rural home, the film comically depicts the utter confusion of the people in her village. Is she a representative of the new age or just a glamorised sex worker? This poignant antiwar film cast Takamine in perhaps her most famous role – as a primary school teacher witnessing the devastating impact of militarism and war on her students in rural Japan. Takamine’s heartrending portrayal, grappling with the moral quandaries of wartime, deeply moved its audience. While its exclusive focus on Japanese victimhood has been highlighted by film critics including Sato Tadao, a pioneer in the research of Asian films, the open depiction of Japanese suffering was novel after years of American postwar censorship. This novelty, along with the film’s use of nostalgic music, goes a long way to explaining the film’s impact. Takamine’s transformation from youthful educator, shocking the rural people riding a bicycle to work (how unladylike…), to a broken woman in mourning is unforgettable. Takamine delivers a powerful performance as Keiko, a widowed bar proprietor navigating the complexities of running a hostess bar on her own. Keiko struggles financially, but what are her options? Giving in to her male customers, waving their wallets around while they vie for her affection and her body? Should she start a new business altogether? Or get remarried, possibly to one of the more decent looking regulars? Takamine’s own persona as a film star, finding her own way as an independent woman without relying on a man’s money, is intertwined with Keiko’s story. This is what gives the film its authentic power. It’s one of Takamine’s most haunting performances – and a strong warning to her fans never to rely on a man. Takamine was married to screenwriter Matsuyama Zenzō in 1955. The marriage fitted her developing persona and was celebrated as a partnership between equals. The groom was far from being a good catch financially for the film star. The Happiness of Us Alone was Matsuyama’s debut as a director, and this collaboration was a manifestation of their artistic partnership, with the film celebrating marital love. Portraying a deaf couple’s struggle against postwar societal challenges, the film delves into disability and social inclusion. Takamine’s commitment to authenticity, demonstrated by her learning sign language for the role, adds a layer of depth and empathy to this powerful story. By 1967, Takamine was a seasoned veteran in front of the camera. And in The Wife of Seishu Hanaoka, she skilfully deploys her talents to show the darker side of the human soul – and the sacrifices some women are ready to make for men’s affections. Takamine plays the jealous mother of a historical Edo period surgeon, embroiled in rivalry with her daughter-in-law for his affection. They go so far as to offer themselves as human guinea pigs for his often-terrifying experiments with anaesthesia and appear willing to sacrifice their health and even their lives for his success. Takamine’s chilling depiction of determination and contempt for her daughter-in-law remains unsettling to this day. Men in Japan often remain the sole breadwinners for their families, making their success critical for the family and relegating the women to a background role. These six films represent just a small fraction of Hideko Takamine’s wide-ranging oeuvre, but together provide a fascinating insight into her acting prowess and the themes running through her work. Takamine was an iconic artist whose work reflected and shaped womanhood in 20th century Japan. In the year of her 100th birthday, these powerful and authentic performances are ripe for rediscovery and deserve to be more widely seen outside Japan. Looking for something good?

University of Bristol provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners Seventy years after his first appearance in the 1954 Japanese film Gojira, Godzilla has become a global star. Meanwhile King Kong, his gigantic Hollywood counterpart, has been circling the globe for a shade over 90 years. The two come together  in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire for the second time in the MonsterVerse film franchise, this time as unlikely partners protecting the Earth. Godzilla’s globalisation began early in the character’s life. In 1956, Gojira was remade, with new scenes starring Canadian actor Raymond Burr as a US journalist explaining the film’s action to American audiences. The local and transnational politics of the Godzilla franchise have been mutating ever since. Godzilla began as an post-war destroyer of human cities like Tokyo, but over time the character has shifted, occasionally becoming humanity’s protector, an eco-warrior and even (infamously) a father in Son of Godzilla in 1967. The MonsterVerse films, which began with Godzilla in 2014 have replayed as many of the Japanese franchise’s main themes as it has remixed and amplified them. Across five films, the MonsterVerse has emerged as slick, well-defined giant monster mythos that has further globalised Godzilla – and King Kong along with him. Read more: Why Godzilla is the perfect monster for our age of environmental destruction In the original Japanese film, Godzilla is awakened by American atomic bomb testing in the Bikini Atoll. He represents a warning about the dangers of nuclear power. But by contrast, in the MonsterVerse, nuclear power stations and bombs are used routinely to “power up” Godzilla. This is taken to new extremes in Godzilla x Kong. Godzilla not only absorbs the nuclear radiation from a power plant, but also turns quasi-cannibal, killing the sea-serpent Titan Tiamat to absorb its power. This extra dose of radiation results in a radical new look. Each of the Titans (ancient gigantic creatures) in the MonsterVerse has its own colour scheme. Tiamat’s signature colour is pink, and so for the second half of Godzilla x Kong, Godzilla shines with rosy radioactive hues. The MonsterVerse has added the idea of the “Hollow Earth” to bolster Godzilla’s murky origin story. Hollow Earth is a longstanding myth about a world existing inside our own, which has been the subject of conspiracy theories. In the MonsterVerse, the Hollow Earth is a pre-modern landscape filled with Titanic creatures. In Godzilla x Kong, King Kong is in Hollow Earth searching for his lost species. In this way the film is something of a sequel to director Adam Wingard’s 2021 Godzilla vs Kong. In it, Kong discovers an enslaved giant ape community near the heart of the Hollow Earth, under the control of the Skar King. The Skar King is another giant ape who controls Shimo, the Titan whose icy breath brought on the last ice age. Defeated and badly injured in his initial attempt to free this giant ape community, Kong turns to his human friends from Monarch (the subject of Apple TV’s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters) for help. In a nod to the popularity of the Transformers franchise, Monarch provides Kong with an exoskeletal arm with which to fight the Skar King. When Kong and Godzilla finally come together they make inventive use of the Hollow Earth’s passageways. Ever since Godzilla began travelling these tunnels to destroy global cities like San Francisco (in the franchise’s first film), the MonsterVerse filmmakers have been carefully selecting famous global cities for the Titans to use as wrestling rings. In Godzilla x Kong alone, Godzilla’s battles take place in Rome, Egypt and the Arctic. The Skar King’s obsession with the surface world brings him eventually to Rio de Janeiro. The city is burned, frozen and stomped on as Godzilla and Kong face off against their enemies. There is humour in these battles, in which familiar tourist destinations are ripe for destruction. Among the beloved national landmarks reduced to rubble is the Coliseum, which becomes a giant cat bed for Godzilla. But, there is also an industrial logic to the way the locations are being selected. The Chinese-owned production company, Legendary Pictures, are working with their American studio partner, Warner Brothers, to maximise the MonsterVerse’s global appeal by taking a global approach to these battlegrounds. Through these familiar cities, the MonsterVerse films are carefully targeted to audiences from across the globe. And, the opening weekend’s blockbuster box office shows that this strategy is paying off. It can even be seen in the transnational casts. Previous instalments of the franchise have featured major international stars like Ken Watanabe, Juliet Binoche and Ziyi Zhang, balanced out by Hollywood stars like Brian Cranston and Millie Bobby Brown. Aside from the Titans, Godzilla x Kong is largely populated by secondary characters from previous films, along with broadly drawn characters like Trapper, a dentist and vet for Titans (Dan Stevens on scene-chewing form). This is where the young Jia, played with graceful poise by Kaylee Hottle, comes into her own. Jia is the lone survivor of the Iwi people of Skull Island (wiped out in an off-screen Titan disaster). Hottle, a rising star, is a deaf performer, and provides a signed, subtle performance that supplies the film’s heart. However, in Godzilla x Kong it seems like the Titans are finally the main attraction in their own movies. As Godzilla and Kong make themselves at home in semi-flattened cities all over the world, the global power of the MonsterVerse is hard to argue with. Looking for something good?

Located six hours north of Adelaide, South Australia, the area is a landscape that anyone but a geologist would describe as barren: crumbling, iron-stained earth, scrubby vegetation and a summer heat that melts the asphalt. The strange fossil he discovered was shaped like a pancake and ribbed like a palm frond—an imprint of some long-ago creature laid down in the sand. Sprigg didn’t know it then, but he’d just discovered what was—at that time—the earliest fossil evidence of complex, multicellular animal life on Earth. The landscape of low hills surrounding his find would later lend its name to a newly discovered geologic period—the Ediacaran—and the fossils within would prove an inflection point in our understanding of how life evolved on our planet. Today, the site is known as Nilpena Ediacara National Park. In 2020, with the assistance of The Nature Conservancy, the South Australian government acquired a vast swath of the area from its previous private landowner. The park protects not only the area’s fossil treasures but also threatened woodland habitats, endangered wildlife and Aboriginal cultural heritage sites. It’s a place where the biodiversity of the past and present meet, where kangaroos and bearded dragons sun themselves atop fossils of their earliest ancestors. “This place captures the dawn of animal life—the initial diversification of animals, of things that move and reproduce in different ways,” says Mary Droser, a paleontologist at the University of California Riverside who has studied fossils at Nilpena for more than 20 years. “It’s an extraordinary place, and it doesn’t matter that the organisms are half a billion years old.” Droser explains that, for a portion of the Ediacaran Period between 635 to 541 million years ago, this section of Australian outback was shallow sea, where Earth’s earliest animals scuttled across a mat of organic scum that built up on the ocean floor. Occasionally, a storm would blow over the sea, washing in sediments that would settle to deposit a layer of fresh sand and smother many creatures in place. For paleontologists, that layering of microbial mat and fresh sand is what makes Nilpena such an extraordinary fossil site. “The organic mat works as a separator between the storms, like when you buy steaks and there’s that paper between them that makes it easy to pull apart,” says Droser. “We’ve excavated these beds, turned them over and reconstructed large swaths of seafloor that are literal snapshots of the Ediacaran Sea.” Droser and her team have discovered more than a dozen new genera in Nilpena’s rocks. Over the years, Nilpena has revealed the raisin-shaped Attenborites (named for Sir David Attenborough) and Obamus coronatus, a small, round fossil that looks like a braided pastry and is named for the former U.S. president. “A lot of our discoveries happen because we’re on our hands and knees and we’re like, ‘What the heck is this?’” Nilpena is one of a handful of prolific Ediacaran sites in the world, and the only one where paleontologists have excavated whole beds. That allows Droser to reconstruct the lost ecosystem and investigate a host of questions that paleontologists are rarely able to study, particularly how these early life-forms may have interacted with one another. To help answer those questions, the paleontologists use a combination of mapping and imagery techniques, including laser scanning and photogrammetry, to digitize the fossil seafloor. They take the data with them for further study in California, leaving the fossils where they found them. “We can ask very different questions and get a really deep insight at Nilpena,” says Droser. “We have the oldest bilaterian [in the research record],” she says, referring to the symmetrical body plan shared by essentially all modern animal life, except corals and sponges. Within these rocks, they’ve found the earliest evidence of animal mobility, scavenging behavior and even sexual reproduction—finds that are contributing to what scientists know about the history of life on Earth. Perhaps almost as wondrous is that these fossils have survived all this time. For more than 150 years, Nilpena has been the site of working sheep and cattle stations (the term for a ranch in Australia). But its most recent owners, Ross and Jane Fargher, appreciated the land’s biological and paleontological heritage and took care not to overgraze their lands.  In an interview with Science, Ross Fargher said that he first noticed some unusual rocks on his property in the mid-1980s, when a visitor pointed out the wavelike ripple rock that made up the floor of his 100-year-old woolshed. Soon, paleontologists and looters were carting loads of rock back to Adelaide. “Alarm bells started to go off,” he told Science, describing how sites in both Nilpena and the Ediacara Hills were “pretty well stripped bare.” Fargher agreed to allow research on his property, but only if scientists left the fossils where they found them, keeping Nilpena’s rich paleontological heritage in place.  In January 2020, TNC helped the South Australian government purchase almost 150,000 acres of the 211,000-acre Nilpena Station with funding provided by The Wyss Foundation, a campaign of the Swiss philanthropist Hansjörg Wyss. The new Nilpena Ediacara National Park, which opened to the public in April 2023, protects the site’s extraordinary fossils while also adding critical ecosystems to the country’s collection of protected areas—a step toward hitting the country’s conservation targets.  Australia committed to following the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, an international agreement to reverse the loss of wildlife and habitat. A key part of the agreement is the “30x30” target, which asks nations to conserve at least 30% of their lands and oceans by 2030. Australia currently has about 22% of its land under protection, says James Fitzsimons, the senior advisor to global protection strategies for TNC. But, he says, 29 of the country’s 89 bioregions have less than 10% of their area protected. “A key element of 30x30 is ensuring the protected-area network is ‘ecologically representative,’” says Fitzsimons. “That means ensuring the full range of ecosystems and habitat types are included and emphasizing areas of particular importance for biodiversity.” The creation of this national park boosts protection for Australia’s Gawler bioregion, which has vast salt lakes, spinifex grasslands, and rocky hills and plains interspersed with arid woodlands. The park also protects cultural heritage sites of the Adnyamathanha people, the Traditional Owners of the land who camped near permanent springs, leaving behind ash and charcoal middens that can still be seen thousands of years later. The South Australian government is partnering with the Adnyamathanha to help protect heritage sites and incorporate traditional ecological knowledge into park management. Nilpena was the first of several land purchases facilitated by TNC in Australia in recent years. Other recent deals have protected savannah woodlands on Cape York Peninsula and nationally significant wetlands in New South Wales. A key part of TNC’s protection strategy in Australia, says Fitzsimons, is the organization’s flexibility. Rather than purchasing the land outright, TNC works with nonprofit organizations, Indigenous groups and state governments to create new protected areas under a variety of different mechanisms. To date, the organization has assisted in the protection of around 50 million acres—a collective area roughly the size of South Dakota or Nebraska. For Nilpena, now one year into becoming a national park, the efforts to conserve the area have just begun. The land sits within the Flinders Ranges region—home to the most renowned mountain range in South Australia—which is currently being considered for UNESCO World Heritage status. The mountains, about 45 minutes due east of the new park, are one of Australia’s iconic landscapes and home to vulnerable species like the yellow-footed rock-wallaby and western quoll. “Creating the Nilpena Ediacara National Park means we can manage the fossil sites to ensure security and management regimes are put in place, while providing for controlled visitor access and ongoing research,” says Irving.  “This will enable the potential World Heritage values to be protected in perpetuity and shared with the world.” Droser and her team still return to Nilpena each year, crawling across the ancient seafloor to map each and every blob or squiggle on the sandstone. “People ask me, ‘Why is this place important?’ It’s about understanding that the Earth has a history, and that there are organisms that went extinct because of past environmental change,” she says. “It’s because we have to understand the fate of past life on Earth to better understand our future.”"," “This place captures the dawn of animal life—the initial diversification of animals, of things that move and reproduce in different ways,” says Mary Droser, a paleontologist at the University of California Riverside who has studied fossils at Nilpena for more than 20 years. “It’s an extraordinary place, and it doesn’t matter that the organisms are half a billion years old.” Droser explains that, for a portion of the Ediacaran Period between 635 to 541 million years ago, this section of Australian outback was shallow sea, where Earth’s earliest animals scuttled across a mat of organic scum that built up on the ocean floor. “The organic mat works as a separator between the storms, like when you buy steaks and there’s that paper between them that makes it easy to pull apart,” says Droser."

They learned how to grow mushrooms and how to make creams and salves. In one-on-one consultations, attendees learned about applying for grants for their agriculture businesses. That evening, participants gathered around a bonfire at a nearby farm and ate soup made from the plants grown in the area. The event, in its fourth year, was hosted by an Ohio-based organization called the Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) Food and Farming Network. Launched in 2021, it’s a community-driven network of area growers, as well as those interested in food justice and food policy, joining together for support—one of many grassroots efforts around the country. River Johnson was born into a military family. When she was 12 years old, her family moved to Mad River Township, outside of Dayton. It was there that Johnson developed an appreciation for nature, roaming the countryside near her home as a child. She recalls that her family was one of the first Black families to integrate the community. “I remember moving there and being confronted with racism,” Johnson says. “When we moved there, they actually shot out our window.” In the face of that racism, Johnson’s family stayed in the community, and her mother grew a vegetable garden, not so much because she loved to garden, but because she loved to cook. Johnson herself worked in the corporate sector before finding her calling in working with the earth. While getting her master’s degree at Antioch University Midwest, she studied different types of food systems, such as market gardens, permaculture, and those using biodynamic frameworks and organic farming methods. “I started working with several community gardens and community centers, helping to establish perma-culture gardening, Indigenous gardening methods, and teaching and doing little workshops,” Johnson says. BIPOC farmers in particular, she says, face a lack of money and safety, making it challenging to grow in the regenerative farming space. Today Johnson is developing a garden in a historically underserved community in West Dayton. There, she grows primarily native plants, trees and shrubs. She uses gourds she grows as canvases to paint on. And she collects seeds from and propagates more than 20 species of native plants—the beginnings of her dream of a future native plant nursery. “I want to have my business there,” Johnson says. “I want it to be a demonstration of what a pollinator garden looks like, what wildlife habitat looks like, and what a regenerative household can look like in an urban environment.” Patty Allen’s connection to farming and advocacy goes back several generations. Allen, the program manager of the BIPOC Food and Farming Network, grew up in Dayton, about 230 miles from an all-Black farming settlement called Stringtown. In the 1860s, her great, great, great grandparents were part of a group of four or five families that co-founded Stringtown in Champaign County, Illinois. By 1905, other Black farmers and businessmen had created a “colored business cooperative,” focused on selling groceries. Allen remembers receiving her first garden plot when she was about 10 years old, launching a lifelong interest in growing food and, later, food justice. She took a break from a career in journalism and public relations to travel to Europe, where she learned about organic farming in Oxfordshire, England. In 2018, she took a farm apprenticeship in Brewster, New York, where she worked hands on raising goats, chickens and vegetable crops alongside a group of nuns. “I wanted to do something that was growing, nurturing, making a difference in the world,” Allen says. In 2022 she returned to Ohio to run what was then known as the BIPOC Farming Network as a program under a local environmental organization called Agraria Center for Regenerative Practice. When that organization developed financial issues in 2023, she took the program independent, determined that it should continue, and later changed the name to reflect its broader mission. Today the BIPOC Food and Farming Network is supported by grants from several organizations, including Hall Hunger Initiative, The Nature Conservancy, Central State University Extension, the Sustainable Agricultural Research and Education program, and its key sponsor, The 365 Project—a local community organization that promotes African American heritage, Black culture and racial equity. Among its initiatives is an annual Black farming conference as well as regular meetings on farming topics and events attended by alumni of a former fellowship program under Agraria that was focused on regenerative farming. In 2023 the group launched a policy fellowship designed to educate farmers about agricultural laws and policies at the local, state and federal levels. “I never knew I could be a farmer,” says Sharifa Tomlinson. Born in 1960 and raised by two schoolteachers in Massachusetts, Tomlinson never saw agriculture as an option. “At that time, at my age, Black women—we could be nurses, we could be teachers, we could be social workers. If we were really good, we could be doctors, lawyers. No one ever said there were other things, too.” Today, she describes herself as a “woods womyn,” as well as a registered nurse, doula and community educator. She helped run the 2023 Black Farming Conference after previously participating in the Regenerative Farmer Fellowship, where she learned regenerative agriculture techniques. In 2017, Tomlinson founded a 12-acre urban sanctuary near Dayton that she calls ARROWROCK FARM, becoming a full-time farmer in 2023. She’s building it into a cooperative urban market for farmers of color and a demonstration farm, complete with housing for those learning about regenerative farming on the property. She recently expanded her poultry farming operations, rapidly growing from 30 chickens to 1,000. She sells her produce and butchered chickens to an Ohio program that distributes them to food banks and pantries. “That’s a big deal to me. I’m able to give out sustainable food that’s locally sourced,” Tomlinson says. “It’s right from here, and it’s going to our community in the Miami Valley.” Tomlinson wants to encourage people in her generation to grow wealth generationally—through passing land to family, or to fellow BIPOC growers—“to make sure that people in my generation know to attempt to leave their land to people in the future generation that will keep on farming it. “If you are a farmer now, or if you have land acreage and want to do something with it, don’t always look at your family,” she says. “Yes, give something to your family, but look at other BIPOC farmers that might want to carry that legacy on, even if they don’t carry your name.” Gregory Muhammad grew up gardening. “My father used to always have a garden in our yard,” says Muhammad, who was raised in Dayton. “And I always planted something myself, even growing up, at five, six, seven—I don’t know how old [I was when] I started.” By the time he became a student at Tuskegee University in the 1970s, Muhammad was already interested in farming. Today the university is one of 107 remaining historically Black colleges and universities in the United States. “I started learning about health and nutrition as well as Black history” there, he says. A longtime educator, Muhammad has taught people how to garden and has provided fresh food to people living in food deserts. He operates a 4-acre farm in Dayton called Oasis. “This year we had corn, okra, green beans, red potatoes, lettuce,"" he says. ""I planted some raspberry bushes last year, so we got quite a few raspberries. I had some watermelon and yellow squash.” Muhammad sells the crops he grows at local farmers markets and festivals. He also works as the garden manager for the Dayton men’s shelter St. Vincent de Paul, and the produce grown there is used in the homeless shelter’s food kitchen. Muhammad’s connections through the BIPOC Food and Farming Network have helped him feel less alone as a Black farmer. It’s been encouraging, he says, “just to know there are other people who want to farm or garden or recognize the need for healthy organically grown foods and vegetables, to know that they are there.” “I’ve been able to reconnect with the land and my heritage in a way I could not have imagined even just two short years earlier,” says Anita Armstead. Armstead, a single mother of three children, including a niece and nephew, gravitated to farming through “happenstance,” she says. “I attended a lecture on food sovereignty, and the need for that in the Black community, the need for Black farms. I prayed and asked God how I could help.” In 2021 a community member who wanted to see their land used to grow food allowed Armstead to begin farming their 3.5-acre plot of land in a quiet neighborhood of Dayton. Two years later, Armstead bought the land outright. She named it Eden’s Harvest. Farming is a part of Armstead’s ministry. “I feel that the land is a gift for us. It’s an opportunity for us to not only connect with our maker, but to actually connect with ourselves.” Armstead grows zucchini, squash, beets, cabbage, broccolini, lettuce, tomatoes and peppers, in addition to amaranth, wildflowers and sunflowers. People in her neighborhood are able not only to gather food from her farm, she says, “but they can also learn how to grow food themselves. “In the future, our goal is to grow more culturally appropriate foods that really hold space for the cultural practices of our community as BIPOC people,” Armstead says. “Foods like collard greens, and dark leafy greens, and okra, potatoes, beans and watermelon.” She works with a Dayton-based food truck called Food for the Journey, which prepares hot meals for the community. “As we expand, we are definitely looking for other ways to distribute and partner with work that’s already being done in the community to increase food access,” says Armstead. Now, Armstead wants to do even more. In 2023 she joined the BIPOC Food and Farming Network’s policy fellowship to learn about agricultural laws and how to advocate for policy change. The network, she says, has also connected her with people of many different experience levels who are all working to change the food system in some meaningful way. “For me, that has been beneficial because not only do I get to see through others where I can go, but it also allows me to see where I’ve been,” she says."," The event, in its fourth year, was hosted by an Ohio-based organization called the Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) Food and Farming Network.

Then, hidden in the darkness, they move, rippling down the Delaware River in an ancient annual mass migration. For many years, the eels matured in the healthy freshwater habitat of the Upper Delaware, but natural instincts—and other unknown factors—have impelled them to uproot their lives. Now they begin a final months-long migration to the place of their birth: the Sargasso Sea, at the intersection of four Atlantic currents. There they’ll spawn, laying tens of millions of eggs in the open ocean, and die. At least, that’s what the scientists think happens. “Eels can live in our rivers for about 15 years. And then on some [usually stormy] night in the middle of fall, some take off and go back to wherever they came from,” says Mari-Beth DeLucia. She’s the director of land protection for Pennsylvania and Delaware for The Nature Conservancy, and she’s on the anguillid eel specialist group for the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is a global United Nations-associated conservation group. “But that’s not very scientific.” Many mysteries enshroud the American eel. First, no one—not a scientist nor the crew of a fishing boat—has ever witnessed eels spawning in the wild, which would be a crucial step to learning exactly where eels reproduce and thus what habitat they need. Only in the last 12 years have scientists put tracking devices on American eels and mapped their journey to their spawning grounds in the Sargasso Sea. And what triggers the eels to start that final migration? There are a lot of theories, but nobody knows for sure. Meanwhile American eels are considered endangered by the IUCN, which publishes a global list of threatened species. After decades of declines, the American eel population has stabilized at a historic low. They were hit hard by overfishing; there’s a lucrative global industry for young eels that has at times made poaching off the U.S. Atlantic coast more common. Another lingering, longstanding threat has been the loss of the freshwater habitat they, and so many other fish, rely on for much of their lives. Freshwater ecosystems are some of the most threatened in the world—broken up by dams and polluted by agriculture and cities. In the case of eels, large dams on rivers throughout the U.S. East Coast block migrations both upstream and down, and hydropower turbines sometimes chop up the adults as they make their way to the sea. A pair of simultaneous research projects are trying to shed some light on the eels’ migration. The scientists have begun tracking adult eels as they migrate down the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers to identify what environmental triggers launched these movements. Because the Delaware has no major dams and the Susquehanna has four, the twin research projects offer a tantalizing opportunity to pinpoint what conditions spark the eels to migrate and how obstacles like dams affect their migration to the Atlantic Ocean. If the two teams can identify what makes the eels begin their trek, they might be able to predict their migrations in the future. The answers they find will go a long way toward protecting migrating eels. The phone rings. When Jessica Best, a New York state biologist, answers it, a fisherman on the other end of the line tells her what she’s been waiting to hear: The eels have arrived. She calls the other researchers. DeLucia gets in her car and drives four hours north to a meeting point along the Neversink River, a tributary to the Delaware. Others come, too. There’s Dewayne Fox, a biologist and professor for Delaware State University, who is the principal researcher for this project. Best and Amanda Simmons are both New York biologists for their state’s Department of Environmental Conservation. And there are the weir fishers. Fishing weirs—rock or wood enclosures built in the river to capture fish as they move up- or downstream—have been used since ancient times by Indigenous Peoples and other fishers. Fishers hand over several eels to the biologists, who work quickly to surgically insert tiny transmitters. After sewing up the eels, the scientists watch the fish slither away downstream. As they pass underwater receivers placed throughout the river’s length, the tiny transmitters inside them will ping. About 20 years ago, when DeLucia was just starting her career, she noticed that very few people in the research world seemed to be talking about eels. “Eel numbers were crashing, and nobody knew why,” she says. “But nobody had any information because nobody ever cared about eels.” It’s a complication that other researchers cite, too. Eels have captured the imagination and horror of the general public for centuries, but they’re not studied as much as, say, American shad or Atlantic sturgeon. “They’re probably unattractive to many people. A lot of folks think they look like snakes—or they think they are snakes. You know, they’re not a warm and fuzzy fish,” says Sheila Eyler, a project leader for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Mid-Atlantic Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office. Eyler has studied eels and, as she puts it, other “ancient things” for decades. “They’re very cryptic.” They’re not snakes, or even reptiles, of course. American eels are ray-finned catadromous fish, which means they live much of their lives in freshwater rivers and estuaries but spawn in the ocean. That makes their life cycles the inverse of those of other migratory fish that, like salmon, are anadromous—meaning they live in the ocean and spawn in rivers. Each year American eel eggs hatch into leaf-shaped larvae in the Sargasso Sea and float along the Gulf Stream and other ocean currents until they reach the eastern seaboard of the Americas. By this point they’ve grown into transparent, androgynous “glass eels.” As they migrate upstream, they’ll grow into 4-inch “elvers” and then larger “yellow eels.” Over time, females may travel farther upstream than males due to their larger size. After more than a decade in freshwater habitat, they’ll undergo a process called “silvering,” where adults will sexually mature, growing larger eyes and larger stores of fat as they prepare to begin their migration back out to sea. That life cycle has intrigued some people for millennia. Ancient Egyptians believed eels were associated with the sun god Atum, created when the sun warmed the Nile. Aristotle, puzzled by the eel’s ability to appear in land-locked pools after rain, hypothesized that they emerged spontaneously from the mud. A young Sigmund Freud reportedly dissected young eels, searching for sex organs that were not there. Fascination has borne out even as researchers have begun to answer some questions. Danish biologist Ernst Johannes Schmidt discovered in 1921 that European eels—a cousin of American eels—migrate to the Sargasso Sea to spawn. He reached this conclusion after years spent systematically trawling the ocean in search of ever-smaller eels. A century later, scientists confirmed that journey using satellite tags on adult European eels. Still, no one has witnessed eels breeding in the wild—something DeLucia calls the “Holy Grail” of eel scholarship in part because, in a changing climate, understanding their habitat needs could become critical to maintaining the species. “If things are changing and they rely on the Gulf Stream to ferry larvae back to the coast and that starts to shift, not knowing where they start is a problem,” she says. Scientists aren’t the only ones on the hunt for eels. Prized as a staple in foreign cuisines, eels cannot spawn in large-scale aquaculture settings. That has led aquaculture businesses to seek out glass eels to raise. The U.S. glass eel harvest is banned in all but South Carolina and Maine, where it’s regulated and lucrative. (A single pound of glass eels, harvested legally in Maine, can sell for more than $2,000.) Globally, the trade is so profitable that young eels are said to be more valuable than their weight in heroin. In 2018, the head of the Sustainable Eel Group, Andrew Kerr, called the multibillion-dollar eel black market the “biggest wildlife crime by value on Earth.” As DeLucia, Fox and their colleagues were just beginning their eel-tracking research on the Delaware River, a nearly identical effort was underway just 60 miles west on the slow, rolling Susquehanna River. The Susquehanna is everything the Delaware is not. The Delaware River, flowing 330 miles from Hancock, New York, to the Delaware Bay, is the longest free-flowing river in the eastern U.S. It provides drinking water for millions of people in the Northeast and is the site of a landmark environmental effort that stopped the construction of a major dam in the 1970s."," For many years, the eels matured in the healthy freshwater habitat of the Upper Delaware, but natural instincts—and other unknown factors—have impelled them to uproot their lives.

Jason Throneberry, a TNC freshwater program director, talks fish cannons, endangered Alabama sturgeon and getting fish past dams.","Alabama has some of the most diverse fresh water in the United States. But dams have blocked the migrations of some fish on the state’s iconic Alabama River for decades. Jason Throneberry, the director of freshwater programs for The Nature Conservancy in Alabama, tells how a major partnership is trying to change that by building bypass channels for endangered Alabama sturgeon and other fish. “Bypass channels are, at the very least, a lifeline to those species,” says Throneberry. “This is a long game, and keeping that forward momentum is good.” Jason Throneberry: I grew up in south central Arkansas, and there are some pretty iconic rivers there: The White River, the Mississippi and the Arkansas all come together in the Gulf Coastal Plain. I spent a lot of time hunting and fishing and running around the rivers, and my wife and I were whitewater raft guides for 10 years. We’re river people. JT: I worked for the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission for nine years and went all over the state looking at imperiled aquatic organisms, from cave snails to cave fish, to darters in big rivers, to alligator gar, whatever. I gradually realized that we can manage these species individually, but we really have to work at watershed scale. If we’re going to help these species persist, then we really have to look at the whole picture. JT: We know that pre-dams, the migratory fish runs were just amazing. You had [endangered] Alabama sturgeon and [threatened] gulf sturgeon bumping all the way up against the Appalachian Mountains, trying to get up into the Appalachian portion of these rivers. That doesn’t happen anymore, because these fish can’t do their thing. Not only because there’s a dam there, but you have changed a flowing, riverine ecosystem into a series of reservoirs. There’s no flow variation; there aren’t the big flood pulses anymore. You’ve lost all that. JT: Our research partners have been telling us, “Hey, we don’t know how many more years this population can hang on—or if it’s still there.” If we’re going to do something, the time is now. So you’re two years into a joint feasibility study with the Corps of Engineers—walk us through the process. We started out the feasibility study with around 26 alternatives—everything from full dam removal to bypass channels to fish cannons to doing nothing. JT: Yeah, so they shoot salmon out of these big, huge water cannons to get them over the dam. It’s crazy, dude. Anyway, most of the fish passage [work] that’s been done in the U.S. has been done out West. So it’s very specific to salmon, trout—really strong swimmers. You’ve seen trout runs—they’re just flying through the air. We don’t have those fish. So most of the alternatives were scratched from the get-go. At the end of all that, the Corps of Engineers and TNC agreed that natural bypass channels were the best alternative, because they offer us way more opportunity to mimic what’s natural."," Jason Throneberry, the director of freshwater programs for The Nature Conservancy in Alabama, tells how a major partnership is trying to change that by building bypass channels for endangered Alabama sturgeon and other fish. “This is a long game, and keeping that forward momentum is good.” Jason Throneberry: I grew up in south central Arkansas, and there are some pretty iconic rivers there: The White River, the Mississippi and the Arkansas all come together in the Gulf Coastal Plain.

In 2021, the National Geographic Society and The Nature Conservancy launched a new conservation externship program designed to give youth around the world a very different version of on-the-job training. Instead of being stuck in the mailroom, participants in this virtual education, mentoring and research program have the chance to learn the latest science from a host of experts—then put it into practice. Eight hundred young adults from 123 countries and territories have already started to build skills for careers in conservation while engaging their local communities on topics that are both globally important and personally meaningful. Juan Francisco Suescún, who joined the program from Colombia, says the externship experience helped him connect more closely with communities of fishers in the Caribbean Sea who are facing declining fish stocks. “It felt like there was an opportunity to help people I care for a lot,” he says, “and also to roll up my sleeves and get to work for a cause that I find incredibly important.” As the program progressed, each participant selected aconservation issue relevant to their local community. Extern Ijunad Junaid was struck by the fact that many of his fellow Maldivians had little or no access to their island nation’s stunning coastal landscapes, and he worried that the island of Villingili was threatened by a land reclamation project. “I wanted to emphasize just how incredible and precious this island is,” he says, “and also point out the injustice of having so little accessible nature in a country that is world-famous for being beautiful.” Mentors helped externs think about how their chosen topics might be addressed and communicated most effectively, and then apply their new skills to create interactive digital presentations called ArcGIS StoryMaps, which combined text, images and video. “I was impressed by their curiosity and their willingness to learn,” says Cornelius Were Okello, a biodiversity scientist at the University of Bern who served as a mentor. “You could see their StoryMaps getting more detailed, more streamlined and better thought out throughout the process.” There were a few challenges early on, Ireland says. Internet connectivity can be erratic for some externs—participants are offered a stipend to help offset any barriers to joining the program—and coordinating a single schedule across two dozen time zones isn’t always easy. “At first it was a little like building a plane while flying,” she says. “In 2021, everyone was already deep in Zoom fatigue, and we wondered if it would be engaging enough.” But engaging with experts and fellow participants proved to be more than enough motivation for the externs. “They’re so on fire when they log in,” Ireland says. “There were definitely some nerves at first, but the good kind, where you’re anticipating something life-changing to happen,” says Suescún, who visited fishers on Isla Fuerte—an island off the northern coast of Colombia—during his externship. “I was excited to engage with people who had so much experience working for nature.” At the end of the eight weeks, externs can apply for seed funding to continue to develop their projects. About one in 10 who apply receive these extra funds after their proposals are evaluated by independent reviewers. It’s all part of the training, Ireland says—in this case, giving the externs experience applying for grants like professional scientists. If numbers are any indication, the externship program is filling a void in conservation education: To date, there have been more than 25,000 applications for 800 spots. “I think we found something that really resonates with our audience,” Gomez says. “It just shows the tremendous interest globally for this type of experience.” An additional cohort will launch next year with a focus on using powerful computer mapping systems for conservation, and plans are afoot to expand the program in multiple directions. A formal grant-writing workshop is on the list, as is funding for conference travel and setting up speaking opportunities at National Geographic Society and TNC events after each cohort graduates. “We want externs to feel supported by our organizations and know that we’re here to help them wherever they’re headed,” Ireland says. Externs have already used the experience as a launchpad to full-time jobs at places like TNC, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oceana and the Smithsonian Institution. Some graduates have been named National Geographic Society Young Explorers. “It’s been great to see them translating the experience into full-time positions,” Ireland says. The long-term goal is to expand from the current 400 externs per year to 1,500 per year in 2027. In the end, the program is all about opening doors and showing externs the paths others have taken, Gomez says, whether they’re National Geographic Explorers, TNC experts or someone else working to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. “What really energizes me is when our externs say, ‘Wow, I wasn’t aware of this career,’ or ‘This has really reinvigorated me to think about things in a new way.’” Sign up for our monthly Nature News updates for stories, tips for action and event opportunities."," “It felt like there was an opportunity to help people I care for a lot,” he says, “and also to roll up my sleeves and get to work for a cause that I find incredibly important.” As the program progressed, each participant selected aconservation issue relevant to their local community. “I wanted to emphasize just how incredible and precious this island is,” he says, “and also point out the injustice of having so little accessible nature in a country that is world-famous for being beautiful.” Mentors helped externs think about how their chosen topics might be addressed and communicated most effectively, and then apply their new skills to create interactive digital presentations called ArcGIS StoryMaps, which combined text, images and video."

It’s about 9:30 p.m. on a nearly moonless July night on the island of Wassaw—a 3-mile-wide piece of land 14 miles southeast of Savannah, Georgia. From the driver’s seat, Kris Williams Carroll scans the area ahead that’s lit through red filters on the Kawasaki’s headlights. She’s looking for trails in the sand, evidence of sea turtles. “It’ll look like tire tracks,” she says over the engine’s hum. “You can’t miss them.”  They don’t take long to spot: 3-foot-wide parallel grooves running up from the ocean. She cuts the engine. “Wait here,” she tells the three volunteer assistants in the vehicle. Williams Carroll turns toward the sand dunes, and the glow of her red headlamp disappears into the dark. (The red lights disturb sea turtles less than white lights might.) Two minutes later she returns. “She’s still digging. We’ll approach very quietly.” The assistants—all volunteers who pay to be here for a week during the summer—grab their gear and silently head toward a massive dark lump in the sand. The loggerhead sea turtle—a species considered threatened worldwide—is rhythmically moving her flippers, reaching one back flipper at a time below her and flicking a bit of sand away from the hole she’s digging. The group waits for the loggerhead to begin laying her eggs. Once she does, they’ll get to work. Williams Carroll is the director of the Caretta Research Project, a sea turtle-monitoring nonprofit. The organization began tracking sea turtle nesting on Wassaw in 1973, four years after the family that had owned the island since 1866 sold most of it to The Nature Conservancy for $1 million. TNC in turn sold it for one dollar to the Department of the Interior. Today it’s a national wildlife refuge. Each summer here and all along the Georgia coast, loggerhead sea turtles—and occasionally rarer endangered green sea turtles—lay their eggs on the state’s barrier islands and then return to the ocean. About two months later, baby sea turtles emerge from the nests and crawl to the sea. At best, the hatchlings face 1,000-to-1 odds against surviving to adulthood. And the female turtles that do survive won’t be seen on a beach in this region to lay their own eggs for perhaps another 30 years. In 2022, Georgia counted a record 4,071 nests laid along its coastline—an incredible 11-fold increase from a low 18 years earlier. Because it takes a quarter century or more for a sea turtle to reach sexual maturity, the numbers seen now are the result of decisions made decades ago. The loggerheads were legally protected as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in 1978. Changes in nest management in the 1980s resulted in fewer eggs being eaten by predators like coyotes or raccoons. And special modifications on shrimping nets developed in the 1970s and 1980s reduced the number of sea turtles getting caught in the nets. But those changes wouldn’t have helped if the turtles hadn’t had nesting space to return to. For more than 50 years, land conservation along the coast has maintained reliable nesting habitat for the sea turtles. The region is home to some of the oldest sea turtle-monitoring projects in the world—dating to the 1960s on Little Cumberland Island and 1970s on Wassaw. Today the sea turtles still face some predation and boat strikes, and those beaches—though protected—are eroding, making them more susceptible to sea-level rise and rough storms. But the growth of the loggerhead population strikes a note of hope for many of the researchers involved. If they can further stabilize the population at the highs it reached mid-century, perhaps the sea turtles can weather whatever future lies ahead. “Conservation needs to be enduring,” says Christi Lambert, TNC’s director of coastal and marine conservation in Georgia. “We’re in it for the long haul.” The night on Wassaw began at about 8 p.m. as the six volunteers and one intern loaded up two four-wheelers and got their assignments: Half would travel to the north beach and half to the south. Williams Carroll led the south crew, driving through maritime forests of slash pine and live oak that sparkled with fireflies. Low cabbage palm fronds slapped the sides of the vehicle as it made its way to the beach. “My first night, going through here, I wondered what I had gotten myself into,” says volunteer Bre Adkins, a former schoolteacher and current stay-at-home mom. Williams Carroll laughs. “Some people have told me it feels like they’ve been dropped into Jurassic Park,” she says. Sea turtles rely on undisturbed dark sandy beaches and dunes for nesting. But the scale of the conservation that has helped provide the turtles space to nest here goes far beyond the beach. Arriving on Wassaw Island—you can only travel there by boat—you wind through the tidal creeks that part the soft green marshes of Wassaw National Wildlife Refuge. In the summer, painted buntings, Wilson’s plovers, black skimmers and other songbirds call the refuge home. American alligators lounge in freshwater ponds. Juvenile sea turtles forage just offshore. It’s a far cry from many of the shores along the southeastern U.S., where high-rise hotels and condominiums glow throughout the night. On Wassaw’s beaches, the only sound is the roar of the wind and waves, and the only light comes from the moon and the stars. The Georgia coastline—105 miles long—is lined with 14 barrier islands, many of which are  still wild. After the Civil War ended in 1865, wealthy Northerners bought many of these islands and constructed Gilded Age winter retreats on them. For decades, the Rockefellers, the Carnegies, even J.P. Morgan himself retreated to rustic family compounds on the islands. A few generations later, after World War II, some family descendants began to sell off the land. Spurred by 1950s-era construction projects at Hilton Head in South Carolina and Georgia’s own Jekyll Island, conservation-minded landowners turned to wildlife agencies and environmental groups. A series of conservation land deals and easements—several involving the then-nascent TNC—followed in the next two decades. “We identified these areas as priorities many years ago, and we continue to view them as priorities,” says TNC’s Lambert. “It’s that combination of habitat and the management of the habitat and the science—the monitoring—to follow and to learn about and to help these [sea turtle] populations.” Today only four of Georgia’s 14 barrier islands are accessible by bridge. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages multiple islands as wildlife refuges. The National Park Service manages Cumberland Island—and its 18 miles of undeveloped beaches—as a national seashore. Each year more sea turtles nest on its dark, deserted sandy beaches than anywhere else in Georgia. An hour before midnight on Wassaw, the team of volunteers finds another loggerhead laying her eggs. She has metal tags with an engraved code on her front flippers as well as a “PIT tag”—a microchip—that show she has nested on Wassaw before. Her name is Esperanza. (She’s one of the project’s “adopt-a-turtle” subjects.) The team has a relatively short amount of time to work before she finishes laying her eggs and begins to cover her nest in sand. They have a lot to do. One volunteer—18-year-old Spencer Haltom—begins measuring the length and width of the turtle’s carapace, or top shell. Bre Adkins calculates the location of the sea turtle’s nest away from the shore and the geographic coordinates of this specific spot. Williams takes three biopsies from the turtle’s front flippers. Haltom’s mother, Allison—a veteran volunteer here for her seventh season—grabs an egg from beneath the turtle and places it in a plastic Ziploc bag. The egg will be processed back at the team’s inland cabin, and genetic material from it will be saved in a test tube. Williams Carroll disappears into the dunes to dig a new hole for these eggs: Esperanza laid her nest in the “wrack line”—the high-water line of debris that washes up on shore. If the nest isn’t moved, it will flood at high tide and the eggs will drown. Up to half of Wassaw’s nests are moved like this, a possible indication of the erosion even this protected beach suffers. All of these efforts to better understand the loggerhead sea turtle population that nests from here through North Carolina—a population considered genetically distinct from Florida’s—have been built in part on the work of a researcher on Little Cumberland Island. Jim Richardson, a now-retired University of Georgia ecologist, first began cataloging nests on the island where his family had a home in 1964. Two years later, nest monitoring began on Blackbeard Island, followed by Jekyll Island in 1972 and then Wassaw in 1973. In 1989, the state’s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) began collecting the data statewide, and the Georgia Sea Turtle Cooperative was born. Today the cooperative monitors 13 beaches along the coast. Sea turtle technicians with DNR permits patrol the beaches each morning before the tide washes away evidence of sea turtle tracks. They mark nests, removing a single egg from the clutch for the genetics project, and then cover nests with a grate that has holes large enough for hatchings to crawl out but narrow enough to prevent predators from looting the nest. When the hatchlings emerge from the nests later in the season, technicians count the hatched and unhatched eggs and the number of dead hatchlings to document nest mortality. “Occasionally there’ll be a few—I refer to them as the Lost Boys—who don’t make it out with the rest of the group,” says Russell Regnery, who has a home on Little Cumberland Island and now runs the sea turtle-tracking efforts on behalf of the homeowners there. “You’ll be digging the nest up and counting the eggshells and suddenly you’ll get a little turtle in your hand and then you send it on its way, too.” Dodd says the long-term nesting data combined with Shamblin’s genetic research has allowed scientists to construct a population model for loggerheads. For now, it’s expected that the population will hold steady. After growing 3.8% each year for the last decade, the population will likely stagnate, Dodd says, reflecting the slow growth of the population in the early 2000s that will soon be reaching maturity. “Then ultimately, maybe in 2040, we expect the population to start increasing back toward historic levels from the late 1950s.” In the dunes on Wassaw, lit by her red headlamp light, Williams Carroll is using a giant heart cockle shell to dig a new hole for Esperanza’s clutch, her arm buried deep in the sand. “It’s the best thing for it,” she says of the shell. The hole, if cut in a cross section, will look roughly like a misshapen upside-down lightbulb. Williams and the team will ultimately move up to half of the nests laid on Wassaw to safer areas farther inland to keep them from drowning at high tide. Williams Carroll, who first came to the Caretta Research Project in 1996, remembers stargazing from a military fort on the north beach that dates to the Spanish-American War. Today the fort is in the ocean. The beach there is studded by dead trees—not unlike the famous Driftwood Beach on Jekyll Island—where soil erosion has allowed salt water to inundate the roots of the old forest, killing the trees where they stand. The wider, sandier south beach—where Esperanza laid her nest—tends to host more nests. The Georgia coastline, lined with 368,000 acres of salt marshes, is ever changing. Rivers run down from the middle of the state, some of them carrying sediment that’s deposited on the islands. When those rivers are healthy, they create an ecological balance: The ocean washes away the islands and the alluvial rivers build them up. Nowhere is this more visible than about halfway down the coastline on Little St. Simons Island, where its northern beach is growing at a rate of 2 to 3 feet per year—a boon for the sea turtles that come to nest here and a rarity along the coastline. The 11,000-acre, largely undeveloped landscape sits at the mouth of the Altamaha River—a river TNC’s Christi Lambert calls “Georgia’s little Amazon.” At times the river can stretch 6 miles wide, flooding freshwater tidal forests, the water brown with the earth it carries. Down the coast this year, Lambert helped the homeowners of privately owned Little Cumberland Island construct a “living shoreline”—reinforcing shores and dunes with natural materials like sand or vegetation. There are 10 more completed installations she can name off the top of her head, a string of projects designed to test natural ways to slow coastal erosion caused by storms and sea-level rise. “It’s important now,” Lambert says, “to work with climate-change predictions and modeling and manage the coast for that—to recognize that in addition to a changing climate and the threats coming from that, we have an increase in people using these beaches, too.” On Wassaw, Esperanza has returned to the sea. And, just after midnight, the crew spots another turtle. As she lays her eggs, locked in a trance, the volunteers complete their work and then sit beside her, taking the moment in. One front flipper bears a metal tag marked “KKU798.” She’s been here before. The sand glints on the sea turtle’s carapace, and one of the volunteers shuts off her red headlamp. In the dark, a wave of iridescence sparkles on the turtle’s shell. “Look at the fluorescence,” says volunteer Amelia Gleaton Luke, a former high school science teacher. Among the barnacles on her back, KKU798 is carrying tiny bioluminescent creatures on her journey. KKU798 eventually lumbers toward the sea, where an otherworldly glow shimmers along the edges of the waves. More fluorescence. Once she’s done nesting—sea turtles sometimes nest repeatedly in a single season—she’ll likely head off to the Chesapeake Bay area peninsula, Williams Carroll says. Satellite transmitters the program attached to a couple of sea turtles this year indicate the reptiles are moving up that way. “There’s great feeding grounds there,” she says. Eventually, the transmitters and past research have shown, this sea turtle will likely return to a beach along this coastline to nest again in two or three years. Williams Carroll could soon start seeing the nests of some of the turtles that hatched in 1996, her first season on Wassaw. She seems to not have dwelled on that idea much till now. “It’s a neat thought,” she says. “But everything we’re seeing here now is the result of people before us: we’re seeing the results of their labor.” It’s a sentiment shared by Mark Dodd. “At one point we were very concerned that we were losing loggerheads as a species in Georgia,” he says. “We stand on the shoulders of all these folks who were here in the ’60s and ’70s. It was a lot of hard work to maintain a very high quality of data. We just need to maintain that so we can continue to get those answers that we need to manage the population.” The moon finally rises around 4 a.m. on Wassaw, and the sun follows not long after. Bug-bitten, sleepy but energized, the week’s crew of volunteers returns to the mainland the next afternoon and off to their daily lives. Two days later the first hatchlings of the season emerge from a nest laid in May. They crawl into the ocean at dawn."," It’s about 9:30 p.m. on a nearly moonless July night on the island of Wassaw—a 3-mile-wide piece of land 14 miles southeast of Savannah, Georgia.

Greg Cooper, a forest ecologist for The Nature Conservancy in North Carolina, is leading an experimental effort to slow the shift and give the oaks and hickories—important for local wildlife—a fighting chance. Greg Cooper: I grew up in upstate New York, in a small town outside of Albany. I was really interested in reptiles and amphibians. My dad [and I] would do frog-calling surveys. We’d listen to get a sense of how many frogs were in an area, and a huge decline in amphibian populations was observable even in that time. After undergrad, I served in Paraguay for two years as an environmental action volunteer working with small landholder farmers, implementing sustainable ag projects. Working in an agricultural economy and seeing how land was being converted in a pretty major way was also superformative. The pairing of those two things—the biodiversity crisis and the conversion of a forest and the impacts that had on biodiversity—was a natural lead-in to forestry. GC: From a historical perspective, this is the cradle of forestry in America. The first foresters were trained right in our backyard, not even half a mile from where I live right now. Ecologically and biologically, this is an incredibly biodiverse region. It has the highest salamander biodiversity in the world. There’s a high amount of diversity of aquatic species. The number of tree species is overwhelming; I still don’t know them all. The most interesting ecotype that we work with, and the biggest, is our oak/hickory forest, [which] is incredibly important for biodiversity because of the food that oaks and hickories provide for wildlife.

Officials counted just 417 nesting pairs—a shocking fraction of the estimated 100,000 birds that once soared the skies in the 18th century, and a grim reinforcement of Carson’s warning against agriculture’s indiscriminate use of chemicals like the pesticide DDT. Other species’ numbers were plummeting as well. A postwar boom in construction, logging and agriculture was polluting the nation’s air and water and degrading habitats for many animals, including grizzly bears, whooping cranes and shortnose sturgeon. Amid a groundswell of public concern for the imperiled wildlife and the broader environment, the federal government began implementing a series of conservation measures. In 1970, Congress established the Environmental Protection Agency, which in 1972 outlawed most uses of DDT. Then, in 1973, President Nixon signed the Endangered Species Act, which mandated steps to protect and restore plants or animals identified as “threatened” or “endangered.” In doing so, it provided a framework
for protecting species and their ecosystems from further decline, and it signaled to the world that direct action could make a difference. Alligator mississippiensis There are only two species of alligator in the world: American and Chinese. The former was listed as endangered under earlier legislation—the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966—after hunting pushed it near extinction. Once protected by the Endangered Species Act’s limitations on alligator products and hunting—as well as increased conservation of its habitat—populations recovered.  American alligators mostly live in coastal parts of the southeastern United States. They rely on fresh water to live but can tolerate salt water for brief periods of time for foraging, says Eric Krueger, TNC’s director of science and stewardship in South Carolina. “They tend to be on the outer coast, where tides promote growth of grassy wetlands where they can build nests and get in the sun.”  With only limited hunting allowed, the American alligator’s primary threat now is habitat loss caused by development and the pressure that climate change is putting on tidal freshwater areas. The Nature Conservancy has been involved in protecting the species by conserving wetlands throughout the Southeast. In South Carolina’s Ashepoo, Combahee and Edisto Basin, TNC has protected more than 83,000 acres, contributing to a combined
310,000 acres privately and publicly protected in the region. Delisted in 1987 and with an estimated population of 5 million today, the American alligator is still monitored because it closely resembles the American crocodile, which overlaps with its range in southern Florida and is listed as endangered.  American alligators help balance ecosystems by keeping populations of species lower on the food chain in check. Today they face a growing new threat: clashes with humans. Though they don’t typically attack people,
alligators are attracted to stormwater ponds in developed areas. Do not leave food there, says Krueger. “Feeding them breaks down their natural fear.” Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus High in the Allegheny mountains of West Virginia and Virginia, the nighttime movements of foot-long flying squirrels are a sign that all is well in this Appalachian world. The nocturnal mammal depends on a specific, truffle-like fungus as its primary food source, and that fungus in turn depends on the roots of healthy red spruce trees. “It’s a web, not a linear relationship,” says Mike Powell, director of land management and stewardship for TNC in West Virginia. The squirrel propagates the fungus through its droppings, exemplifying a symbiotic relationship reflective of a healthy ecosystem. It wasn’t always this way though. Logging activity in the 1800s destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of red spruce, replacing the squirrel’s once-cool, moist habitat with a sun-baked expanse prone to flooding and erosion. “It was described as the greatest spruce forest known to man,” says Powell, “but once it was discovered by industrial loggers, it disappeared very quickly—almost every standing spruce was cut.” By 1985, the squirrel was of such concern that it was listed as endangered, setting into motion a range of conservation projects and partnerships. Among TNC’s collaborators is the Central Appalachian Spruce Restoration Initiative. The Nature Conservancy has also protected thousands of acres of these forests and, to ensure they remain undisturbed by mining, purchased the mineral rights for 57,000 acres on Cheat Mountain as well as 4,000 surface-rights acres in high-elevation areas. “Collectively,” says Powell, “we have planted over 2 million red spruce and associated trees.” That equates to about 70,000 acres in which red spruce is once again the dominant canopy. Delisted in 2013, the squirrel, like so many species, is now threatened by climate change and will require a habitat that is more resilient than ever if it is to survive. These forests have been through several stress points, says Powell. “We’re working as hard and as fast as we can to restore them.”"," Officials counted just 417 nesting pairs—a shocking fraction of the estimated 100,000 birds that once soared the skies in the 18th century, and a grim reinforcement of Carson’s warning against agriculture’s indiscriminate use of chemicals like the pesticide DDT.

The father-daughter duo started their nursery not long ago near Bootless Bay, outside Papua New Guinea’s capital city of Port Moresby. It’s part of a larger project to help regenerate the area’s lost shoreline mangrove trees. Meanwhile, hours away in the mountainside village of Simbukanam, Lawrence Micah is working with local communities to formalize land ownership maps that can be used to prevent loggers from encroaching onto their forested land, and to hold them accountable in court if they do. Though both efforts face uniquely different challenges, they are both trying to save the forests upon which their communities depend. Papua New Guinea is home to about 12 million people, 1,000 distinct cultures and more than 850 languages, some with no linguistic relatives anywhere in the world. The nation’s human diversity is only matched by its ecology: The island of New Guinea boasts the third-largest tract of tropical rainforest in the world, and 30% of its flora and fauna are endemic. It’s home to a greater variety of vascular plants than any other island on the planet and 740 species of birds. “Papua New Guinea is probably the most biologically and culturally diverse place on Earth,” says Richard Hamilton, The Nature Conservancy’s senior science and conservation advisor for the Asia-Pacific region. “It’s an amazing country.” Mangrove forests can strike humans as somewhat unnerving. The trees’ prop roots tangle together in dense thickets, while the decomposing detritus that accumulates around them releases malodorous gases. And all that dark, still water provides perfect cover for snakes and saltwater crocodiles. “When people look at the mangrove, they see somewhere that’s smelly, muddy or dirty,” acknowledges Mazzella Maniwavie, a scientist working on mangrove conservation for The Nature Conservancy in Papua New Guinea. “But mangroves are special, because they are able to grow in a place where no other tree can grow.” A terrestrial plant that survives in salt water, mangroves are a sort of marvel. Acre for acre, mangrove forests can sequester three to five times more carbon than a terrestrial tropical forest. Mangroves also stabilize the coastline, providing a buffer against storm surges and flooding and preventing excess sediment from running into the sea, where it may smother coral reefs. They provide habitat for fish, reptiles and birds. And those are important to Papua New Guineans, which is why TNC is helping local communities lead the way in their conservation. Since Maniwavie was born in 1987, Papua New Guinea’s capital, Port Moresby, has more than doubled in size; it’s now home to 400,000 people. In many ways, though, the nearby inlet known as Bootless Bay feels much the same as it did when she was a girl, tagging along on research expeditions with her father, a marine biologist at University of Papua New Guinea. “Every time I come here it connects me back to where I started,” she says. But Bootless Bay has also changed. People have inadvertently killed mangroves by digging up their roots to collect blood worms, a valuable fish bait. Woodcutting for fuel and construction has also taken its toll, as has a decade of coastal development. Meanwhile, higher tides driven by climate change upset the balance between salt water and fresh water. “It’s painful to watch something get degraded,” Maniwavie says, “especially if you know people don’t really understand the importance of it.” Maniwavie is not simply watching, however. She leads Mangoro Market Meri, a program that encourages Papua New Guinean women (“meri”) to be stewards of the country’s mangroves. Founded in 2016 at a TNC conference that brought together women from across the region, the program connects communities with economic opportunities that let them benefit from nearby mangrove forests without depleting them. At present, that includes sustainably harvesting mud crabs, crustaceans the size of a dinner plate that are in high demand at area seafood markets. The program hopes to link local people with carbon credit initiatives, which could infuse this developing region with global cash. “That provides an incentive to conservation,” Maniwavie says. It’s also vital that women be at the center of the effort. Throughout the Asia-Pacific region, women make up a majority of the population using mangroves. They have a wealth of knowledge about the species of mangrove in their areas and the health of the ecosystem generally. “But then there’s the reality that many communities in Papua New Guinea that you go to, it’s a patriarchal society, and women are not necessarily part of the decision-making process,” Maniwavie says. “So we work with communities to empower the women.” Three hundred miles north of Bootless Bay in mountainous Madang Province, TNC is helping rural people organize to assert their land rights and protect a very different sort of forest. “We’ve always looked at conservation, conservation, conservation,” says Cosmas Apelis, who leads TNC’s efforts here. “But you have to take people into consideration, because they are the stewards of the land.” Madang is a place where people’s lives are not much different from their ancestors’. “The forest is our livelihood,” says Lawrence Micah, who has lived his entire 50 years in the village of Simbukanam. “It’s our food, it’s our hospital, and everything.” He is the chairman of the Gildipasi Conservation Group, an association that represents local villages to give them a stronger collective voice in regional issues. He has witnessed virgin forest cut down by companies that had dubious reputations and even more dubious logging permissions. His goal is to see local land-use rules formalized and recognized by the provincial government. He, TNC and other conservation groups are working with community members to develop land use plans that preserve the forests for the long term. With little involvement from the regional or national governments, they abide by customary property rights, under which the people living nearby are the land’s owners and caretakers. However, resisting logging companies' well-funded operations requires local people to stand together—and get creative. Apelis relates the story of a community that recently discovered a logging operation had encroached illegally onto its land. “It came to a head where they had had enough,” Apelis says. “The company had left all the logging machinery, all the trucks and all that, lined them on the highway. So the people came and took all the keys. And so the police had to come in, and the provincial government had to step in, because people said, ‘We are not going to give back the keys until the government comes and explains why it isn’t doing monitoring and enforcement.’ They put their foot down, and that’s when they got respect.” The Nature Conservancy aids local communities by lending surveying expertise as they formalize their customary land rights and record the locations of critical resources like streams. The organization is also supporting local people in their campaigns to arrange community-wide conservation pledges. Sometimes local leaders disagree about conservation goals, but the discourse among neighboring communities often makes for stronger resolutions in the end. Micah is optimistic that the agreements and some new farming prospects will offset the pressure from outside logging companies. The Conservancy is also connecting people with sustainable economic opportunities—it’s easier to turn down a logging company’s offer to buy your timber rights when you have an alternative source of revenue. New village-based savings and loans have helped entrepreneurs build businesses. Some communities are pursuing organic certification for cash crops like cocoa, coconuts and vanilla. Eventually, TNC also hopes to link communities to nature-based solutions such as the international carbon market, which will help them generate income by conserving their forests. “Conservation should be a development tool,” Apelis says. In Papua New Guinea, that’s a theme that runs from the mountains all the way to the sea (“ridges to reefs,” as many of TNC’s Pacific staffers like to put it). “We build the capacity for people to do conservation, but at the same time, we help empower them economically.” In Bootless Bay, one of the businesses that Mangoro Market Meri supports is Karikari Mangrove Nursery, which Dulcie Egu and her father, Koivi, founded last year after receiving training through TNC. With guidance from Maniwavie, they and their mostly female employees are growing mangrove saplings. The community-based nurseries in Bootless Bay have helped replant more than 3,000 mangroves. Over the next decade, Mangoro Market Meri, which buys the baby mangroves from the nurseries for about a dollar each, aims to plant at least 200,000 more. “We live here, and we know the importance of mangrove,” Dulcie says, standing beside a greenhouse that shelters hundreds of propagules. “We know what mangroves bring into our lives. ... When we cut it down today, if we don’t replace it, then in the future our children will suffer.” In addition to serving as a source of food and wood, Dulcie explains, mangroves protect against floods. She shrugs: Helping them just makes sense. It makes Maniwavie proud. As women plant mangroves in Bootless Bay, and as mountain villages rally around preserving the tropical rainforest, Papua New Guineans take seriously their role as caretakers. “It gives me hope,” Maniwavie says. “The fact that the community takes ownership and the initiative to do the restoration work by themselves, it’s changing the tide. Nobody can do it better than themselves.”"," The father-daughter duo started their nursery not long ago near Bootless Bay, outside Papua New Guinea’s capital city of Port Moresby. The nation’s human diversity is only matched by its ecology: The island of New Guinea boasts the third-largest tract of tropical rainforest in the world, and 30% of its flora and fauna are endemic. “Papua New Guinea is probably the most biologically and culturally diverse place on Earth,” says Richard Hamilton, The Nature Conservancy’s senior science and conservation advisor for the Asia-Pacific region. “When people look at the mangrove, they see somewhere that’s smelly, muddy or dirty,” acknowledges Mazzella Maniwavie, a scientist working on mangrove conservation for The Nature Conservancy in Papua New Guinea."

                                and disappears
           into the muggy                                                                                                    July night. Five minutes later, three more flutter out. At 8:26, there’s a steady stream. By half past the hour, the entrance—a sinkhole 15 feet across—is a vortex of flying bodies. The darkness pulses with leathery wing beats carrying the rush of cold subterranean air, and a quarter of a million bats rise, spiraling into the surrounding trees in a seemingly endless ribbon—the largest summer bat emergence in the eastern United States. “Back in 2010, I thought I’d never see this sight again,” says Cory Holliday, The Nature Conservancy’s cave and karst program director in Tennessee. “I thought gray bats were done for, that they were something I’d tell my kids about.” He feared the impact of white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that started killing hibernating bats in New York in 2006, and soon after began an unstoppable tear across North America. Federally threatened gray bats, year-round cave-roosting mammals that amass in vast colonies, seemed to be at high risk, with the majority of Tennessee’s population relying on just four caves for hibernation. White-nose syndrome takes its name from the white residue it leaves on bats’ faces and wings, but it’s lethal because it wakes bats during winter hibernation—when every calorie counts. “Bats are nature’s ultimate accountant,” says Pete Pattavina, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service bat biologist. “They measure every energy expenditure and gain, and it’s always a delicate balance for them to make it through winter.” The waking of an infected bat during hibernation triggers its metabolism and body temperature to rise. Without a food source to offset those costs, the interruption means that the bat runs through its winter energy store and dies. The disease has slashed northern long-eared bat and little brown bat populations by 90% across their ranges. Indiana bats are not far behind, sustaining an 85% decline. Bat populations were hardest hit in northern states, while those in warmer climes (with shorter hibernations) are faring slightly better. Overall, millions have died nationwide. But, miraculously, the hit to the remaining gray bat populations never came. No one knows exactly why. Bats play a vital role in our ecosystems. They are key seed dispersers and pollinators, and insectivorous bats can eat one-third of their body weight in moths, beetles and other bugs in one night. One study estimates they save the U.S. agricultural industry an annual $23 billion in pesticides. But 15 years after the juggernaut of white-nose syndrome, it’s unlikely that some bats will regain their historic numbers. “A worst-case future scenario is that we see the complete collapse of little brown bats, tri-colored bats and northern long-eared bats,” Pattavina says. “A best case would be a modest increase in abundance, but I don’t expect a big splash of a return.” White-nose syndrome is here to stay, but so is the new collaborative approach to bat conservation it galvanized. “White-nose syndrome gave everyone a shared purpose, and that coordination has spilled over to other bat projects, because we don’t take common species for granted anymore,” says Dustin Thames of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, a frequent partner in Holliday’s efforts. Holliday himself is at the center of Tennessee’s bat action and cave protection. After spending five years surveying life in the state’s caves, Holliday pivoted his program in the early days of white-nose syndrome’s outbreak to focus on bat research and conservation. To protect an animal is to protect its habitat, he says. Tennessee is home to 11,500 known limestone caves, the most of any state in the country; it is a bounty of underground space stemming from the region’s limestone geology. The spirit of collaboration that’s now a hallmark of Tennessee’s bat work is on display at Bellamy Cave. The Nature Conservancy purchased the cave in 2006, when it sheltered 140,000 bats in winter and 35,000 in summer. Today, after gate installations and protection work by TNC and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, those numbers ring in at 350,000 in winter and 250,000 in summer. Tonight, 17 biologists—representing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, the University of Tennessee, Sewanee: The University of the South and the Department of Defense—are here to attach transmitters to as many gray bats as possible to gather tracking data. In a nightly summer ritual, the gray bats traverse a mile of Bellamy’s inky passageways, emerging as darkness falls to forage. That is, except for those that hit the harp trap—a device that looks like its namesake, with strategically spaced strings that snag bats who attempt to fly through and deliver them (unharmed) into a trough below. Two biologists pluck captives from the trough and pop each into a brown paper sack. Runners ferry the bags up a hill to a processing station and clip the bags onto a clothesline. Teams of biologists fetch a bat at a time to record basic information like sex and weight. Each bat receives a tiny forearm band and a transmitter glued on its back. All of this is done on a ticking timer because, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rules, these endangered bats can’t be held longer than 45 minutes to avoid overstressing them. The data from the radio transmitters is key to learning more about these misunderstood mammals: What are critical habitats for foraging and migration? What are their biggest threats, besides white-nose syndrome? As the tagged bats fly, they’ll pass Motus Wildlife Tracking System towers dotted across the landscape. The towers are a recent addition to the biologist’s toolbox; they pick up signals from any passing tagged animal, logging location data that can be easily shared. Motus started as a collaborative way to track birds, but Holliday harnessed its capabilities for bats and has installed 18 towers in Tennessee. The tracking data will shape future conservation efforts, and Holliday hopes it will illustrate where to avoid building wind turbines, a looming threat. Back at Bellamy, it’s almost 10 p.m.; headlamps illuminate five tables strewn with glue bottles and data clipboards. “We have 15 minutes before we have to release,” calls Holliday. Bags still hang from the clothesline, far too many bats to process as the minutes fly. Soon, time is up. In total, the biologists have attached 41 transmitters. Those 41 bats will flit across the landscape, ranging 50 miles in a single night, each Motus tower they pass pinging with a data point that’s a window into a secret life. The biologists head to the clothesline, reach into the bags and withdraw the furious little mammals within. They raise an arm, open a hand and cast each bat back into the night, like an offering to the sky."," The darkness pulses with leathery wing beats carrying the rush of cold subterranean air, and a quarter of a million bats rise, spiraling into the surrounding trees in a seemingly endless ribbon—the largest summer bat emergence in the eastern United States. “Back in 2010, I thought I’d never see this sight again,” says Cory Holliday, The Nature Conservancy’s cave and karst program director in Tennessee. “I thought gray bats were done for, that they were something I’d tell my kids about.” He feared the impact of white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that started killing hibernating bats in New York in 2006, and soon after began an unstoppable tear across North America."

Dragana Mileusnić, TNC's Southeast Europe lead, sees a path forward.","When the war in Ukraine began in 2022, it accelerated an ongoing energy shift: European nations trying to reduce their dependence on Russian gas rushed to build up the continent's renewable energy sources. Among those trying to make that switch happen in the most sustainable way is Dragana Mileusnić. Mileusnić directs The Nature Conservancy's programs in Southeast Europe—a region covering eight countries, including the western Balkans, whose recent history has been shaped by war, austerity and slower development than much of the rest of Europe. In this interview, she tells how she and others at TNC are helping European countries map where to place renewable energy to reduce potential impacts on the environment. Dragana Mileusnić: The freshwater biodiversity in the region is globally unique. There are many species that appear in the Balkans and nowhere else. There are wild rivers and forests that have survived to a much greater extent than anywhere else in Europe. Most of the rivers in Europe have been dammed or channelized—for example, put into concrete riverbeds—whereas, in the Balkans, the rivers are still mostly untouched. That’s what we’re working on protecting. The reality is that given the area’s slower development, the energy sector—including hydropower—has developed more slowly. So now this is one of the last places in Europe where there is a lot of interest in new hydropower. At one point, an analysis [in 2017] showed interest in building 2,000 to 3,000 dams—mainly small structures that would do a lot of damage to rivers without actually creating a lot of electricity."," When the war in Ukraine began in 2022, it accelerated an ongoing energy shift: European nations trying to reduce their dependence on Russian gas rushed to build up the continent's renewable energy sources.

500,Politics,Modi leads BJP counter-charge to quash Opposition claims of ‘changes in Constitution’,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/modi-bjp-counter-charge-opposition-claims-constitution-9292690/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/modi-constitution-1.jpg?w=450,"APRIL 26, 2024",The party's high-decibel offensive includes questioning moves by Congress govts in quota provisions to include Muslims,"For some time now, the INDIA bloc, especially the Congress, has been pitching its battle against the BJP as one to “save the Constitution”. Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP has now taken the fight into the rival camp, accusing the Congress of having, in fact, altered the statute with changes in the reservation promised to SC/STs to benefit Muslims. As the election season gets into right earnest, this is one of the key issues being raised by Modi to target the Congress, as part of the BJP’s larger claims against the party of appeasement towards the minority community. BJP sources admit that the strategy is deliberate, with the party realising that its target of “400 paar (more than 400)” Lok Sabha seats was being projected by INDIA as the first step towards “changing” the Constitution. Specifically, the INDIA messaging has been targeted at SC/STs, with Dalit voters in some parts expressing apprehension about “Babasaheb Ambedkar’s Constitution” being changed. Remarks by some BJP leaders, including candidates in the Lok Sabha polls, suggesting changes in the Constitution only gave the Opposition more ammunition. A BJP leader said they had got feedback from the ground that tribals, besides the minorities and Dalits, were raising questions about the issue. Party leaders also feared that the impression that the BJP could change the Constitution would hurt it in southern states, where it is already looked upon with suspicion by many as a North-centric, majoritarian party. It was then that Modi himself took charge. If, in Gaya, the PM said that even Ambedkar “cannot change the Constitution”, Union Home Minister Amit Shah pointed out in an interview to NDTV that if the BJP wanted to change the statute, it would have done so in the 10 years that it has been in power with absolute majority. “The Congress has a habit of misusing its majority, not us,” Shah said. The counter-offensive, putting the Congress on the spot over quota changes, has followed since. BJP sources said the high-decibel counter-attack is to ensure that the Opposition has no ground left to attack it over the Constitution issue, even if it brings up instances from the past to attack the Modi government. For example, a 2015 advertisement ahead of Republic Day issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting featuring the Preamble without the words “socialist” and “secular”. As controversy followed, BJP ministers had assured that the government had no intention to make any changes in the Preamble, while pointing out that the words had themselves been inserted by the Indira Gandhi government through the 42nd Amendment. Then Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said there was no “harm” in a debate on the issue, and that the image shared by the I&B Ministry was actually of the “original” Preamble. The BJP and RSS have earlier too questioned these changes carried out during the Emergency by the Indira-led Congress government, including a change in the words “unity of the nation” to “unity and integrity of the nation” in the Preamble. Interestingly, the Preamble whose copies were distributed to MPs ahead of the inauguration of the new Parliament building last year also had the words “socialist” and “secular” missing. Again, the government argued that it had shared the “original version” of the Preamble. In between, in 2021, BJP MP K J Alphons moved a motion to introduce a Constitution (Amendment) Bill in the Upper House to amend the Preamble. But when the Bill was to be taken up in February 2022, Alphons was not present in the Rajya Sabha, and hence it was not discussed. During the term of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government, a National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution led by Venkatachaliah Commission was set up in February 2000. Its mandate was to examine “in the light of the experience of the past 50 years as to how best the Constitution can respond to the changing needs of an efficient, smooth and effective system of governance and socio-economic development of a modern India within the framework of the parliamentary democracy” and to recommend changes. Although Vajpayee had clarified that the basic features of the Constitution would not be tinkered with, many had raised doubts about the government’s intent as the statement was issued after K R Narayanan, India’s first Dalit President, warned that there was no need to change the basic features. The BJP has earlier burned its hands over the reservation issue, after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said there could be a review of the provision. Since then, both the BJP and RSS have repeatedly asserted their commitment to reservation for SCs and STs. As for Modi, party leaders argue that he is the last one who needs a certificate to show his commitment to the Constitution, being the PM under whom November 25 has come to be celebrated as Constitution Day.

The other three are the J&K Apni Party, the People’s Conference and the Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP). At a time when the BJP is not contesting any of the three seats in Kashmir, after a build-up that included a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March (his first to Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370), the development deepens confusion over the party’s plans in the Valley. On April 16, speaking in Jammu’s Reasi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah first indicated that the party might not contest in Kashmir when he said the BJP is “not in a hurry to see the lotus bloom in the Valley”. He went on to urge voters not to back National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) or Congress candidates. “We are not going to ‘conquer’ Kashmir as projected by our adversaries. We want to win every heart in Kashmir,” Shah said. The BJP’s decision followed the failure of the INDIA bloc parties NC and PDP to come to an agreement in the Valley. In Jammu, both the NC and PDP are backing the Congress. This means that Kashmir’s mainstream political parties are now pitted against each other in the Valley. While it is expected to be a direct fight between the NC and PDP in Srinagar and in Anantnag-Rajouri (from where PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti is contesting), in Baramulla, the NC’s Omar Abdullah is facing Peoples Conference’s leader Sajad Lone. Sources in the BJP say that this serves the party well, both in deepening the fault lines between the NC and PDP as well as preparing the ground for it for the Assembly elections, which are scheduled to be held by September, as per Supreme Court orders. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had contested all the seats in Jammu and Kashmir – winning two seats of Jammu and one of Ladakh (it was part of J&K at the time), while putting up a poor show in Kashmir. Its best show was in Anantnag, at 8.15% of the votes. Assembly elections were last held in J&K in 2016, making the Lok Sabha polls the first major election to be held in Kashmir post-Article 370 abrogation in August 2019. Many expected the BJP to make the most of it, especially given its improved chances in Anantnag, now called Anantnag-Rajouri, after the addition of areas from the Jammu districts of Poonch and Rajouri. However, BJP insiders say that the developments post-Article 370 were precisely the reason the party is approaching 2024 differently. “In 2019, we knew we don’t have much support in the Valley,” a party leader says. “Since the abrogation (of special status), the BJP has built a narrative that the people in Jammu as well as Kashmir are happy. We have talked about a ‘Naya Kashmir’. But not all people agree… If we had not got sufficient votes, it would have been a blow to our narrative,” the leader says. With Rajouri and Poonch areas included, and parts of Pulwama and Shopian excluded, the political equations have dramatically changed in the Anantnag-Rajouri parliamentary seat. The PDP has called the changes a deliberate move to “rob the PDP of its political base”, as these are seen to have strengthened the BJP’s position. In months to go before the elections, the Centre cleared a long-standing promise of reservation for the Pahari community, now in substantial numbers in Anantnag-Rajouri. However, sources say that ultimately, the BJP’s calculation was that the constituency remained risky even after the changes, given that a majority of its voters are still Muslims. A high turnout from the Kashmiri side of the seat, which is expected given the eagerness for a chance to exercise opinion post-Article 370, could make the BJP plans go awry. Against this backdrop, Shah’s appeal to voters against choosing the NC, PDP or the Congress is being read as a signal of the BJP’s support to parties in the Valley often referred to as the Centre’s proxy by their opponents. When Ghulam Nabi Azad, who founded the DPAP after leaving the Congress, declared his intent to contest from Anantnag-Rajouri, talk went around that he was the BJP’s candidate for the seat. Azad belongs to the Jammu region and it made more sense for him to contest from Udhampur, his home constituency. But Azad later dropped out in favour of the lesser-known Advocate Saleem Parray of his party, reportedly after getting feelers that he wasn’t likely to get much support even from the Paharis, as he was seen as an “outsider”. The Pahari vote in Anantnag-Rajouri is now expected to split between the NC, PDP and the Apni Party’s Zafar Iqbal Manhas, a Pahari leader. Any party that can attract the most Pahari votes is likely to have an edge. The Apni Party, which was formed in 2021 apparently with the Centre’s blessing, and People’s Conference, which is seen as close to the Centre, have already announced support for each other. The BJP’s opponents are watching the developments, especially in Anantnag-Rajouri, with much interest. “They didn’t have much stakes in the Valley,” says a PDP leader. “But after delimitation and after pitting the Gujjar and Pahari communities against each other (on account of the reservation), they have managed what they wanted for the long term. While there were social fault lines between the Gujjars, Paharis, Shias and Sunnis, they didn’t impact politics, which is why a Gujjar leader like Mian Altaf could win earlier from the Kangan Assembly segment, where a majority are ethnic Kashmiris.” Mian Altaf, who is a Gujjar spiritual leader with a large following in the community, is now the NC candidate from Anantnag-Rajouri. Asked about the BJP’s decision not to field candidates in Kashmir, its J&K chief Ravinder Raina said at a press conference in Jammu last week: “Sometimes decisions are made to achieve a big goal.” He also said that the BJP would support “patriotic” parties in the Valley. Party sources say that what Raina meant by “a bigger goal” was the Assembly elections. “We know we are not strong enough at this point in Kashmir. So we decided to support candidates who are in a better position to take on the NC, PDP and Congress… It will also help us forge stronger alliances for the Assembly elections, which are more important to the party than the three parliamentary seats,” a party leader says.

So much so that while addressing a public meeting at Kaliachak in Malda district on Tuesday, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee slammed Mitra-Chaudhary and called her “behaya (shameless)”. The National Commission for Women (NCW) on Wednesday wrote a letter to the state DGP seeking an action taken report on the alleged derogatory remarks of the TMC MP and party No 2 against the BJP candidate, who is better known as “Nirbhaya Didi (fearless Didi) ”. Mitra-Chaudhary, the sitting BJP MLA from the English Bazar Assembly segment in Malda, is contesting against the Congress’s Isha Khan Choudhury and the TMC’s Shahnawaz Ali Raihan. The Congress candidate is the son of sitting MP Abu Hasem Khan Choudhury who has won the seat since 2009. Known popularly as Dalu da, he is the brother of former Union Minister and Congress stalwart A B A Ghani Khan Choudhury. The TMC candidate is an Oxford scholar who was a prominent voice against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Chaudhary is a former journalist, social worker and women’s rights activist. In 2004, she took part in the launch of the National Legal Literacy Mission. In 2008, she served as national advisor of the National Legal Services Authority under the Ministry of Law and Justice. After the 2012 Delhi gang rape, she chaired the special task force on rape, trafficking and violence against women set up by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. That’s how she got the “Nirbhaya Didi” moniker. In December 2013, she resigned from the post amid speculation that she could contest the election from Malda as a TMC candidate. However, she was named TMC candidate from the South Delhi Lok Sabha seat, where she polled only 803 votes. “I had started the ‘Nirbhaya gram (fearless village)’ initiative, which was a social movement to protect the dignity of women. The initiative was well received, and people gave me the ‘Nirbhaya Didi’ name. Today, more people know me as Nirbhaya Didi than by my real name,” said Chaudhary. Two years later, Chaudhary joined the BJP. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, she lost from Maldaha Dakshin by over 8,000 votes. Then, in the 2021 state polls, she won from English Bazar that is part of the Lok Sabha seat. The constituency has been filled with pink hoardings and placards in a unique campaign. While some have photographs of PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah alongside Chaudhary’s image, others have the images of PM Modi and her. All the pink placards have “Vote for Nirbhaya Di” written on them. The pink banners also adorn her vehicles. “We have selected pink as our theme, as it signifies the power of women. We have made pink pamphlets, posters, banners, hoardings and placards. ‘Vote for Nibhaya Di’ means voting for safety, security and protection of women,” said the BJP candidate. Although the constituency is known as a Congress stronghold, the BJP candidate’s campaign has caught the attention of people. “Her campaigning style has caught the eye of the people who are relating to her brand of politics. Her previous experience of fighting for women’s rights has given her an edge over her rivals, so it is going to be a tough contest this time,” said a TMC leader from Malda on condition of anonymity. The BJP leadership has backed her with a roadshow by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Malda town on April 23, followed by a public meeting by PM Modi earlier on Friday. Maldaha Dakshin goes to the polls in the third phase on May 7.

Javadekar, the central BJP leader in charge of Kerala, hit out at state Congress president K Sudhakaran who, on Friday, targeted the Left over Jayarajan’s “plans” to jump ship. “It is bogus news. How does Sudhakaran know who I meet or talk to?” Javadekar told The Indian Express. Though Sobha Surendran, the BJP candidate from Alappuzha, did not name Javadekar, she said on Thursday that Jayarajan had held talks with the BJP. A few days earlier, she claimed that discussions with the CPI(M) leader were held in Delhi. “Did Sobha say I met Jayarajan? How does Sobha know who I meet or talk to?” Javadekar said. Jayarajan has dismissed Surendran’s claims as “utter lies” but admitted that he met Javadekar in Thiruvananthapuram. “I met him at my son’s flat. Javadekar came to the flat realising that I was there. We did not discuss politics. I wanted to go for a meeting and before leaving the flat, I told my son to give tea to Javadekar. I did not inform the party about this meeting,” he said. Asked about Surendran’s allegation that the meeting happened over tea at the home of the LDF convener’s son, Javadekar said, “We may have met in his constituency, the airport, or in Parliament. I do meet a lot of people. I may have shared a meal with Shashi Tharoor or other political leaders. Is it a crime? What’s wrong with it?” The senior BJP leader added, “Sudhakaran should be talking about himself. Why should he make a statement on others?” The controversy has embarrassed the CPI(M) that targeted the Congress throughout the campaign over “soft Hindutva” and the exodus of its leaders to the BJP. “Jayarajan should have been vigilant before getting in touch with such people … In the past also, Jayarajan failed to be careful on such occasions. He should have avoided meeting with Javadekar in the presence of a person of suspicious character (self-styled power broker T G Nandakumar),” Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters after casting his vote in Kannur on Friday. Jayarajan is said to have been unhappy after being overlooked for the position of CPI(M) state secretary after the death of Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.

The BJP has targeted Fernandes for saying that the Constitution had been “imposed” on Goa. The ruling party has accused the Congress of insulting the Constitution and making a “calculated move to break the nation”, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi bringing this up recently. “The Congress candidate is saying clearly that the Constitution was forced on Goa… Is this not an insult to Babasaheb Ambedkar and the Constitution? Today, they are rejecting the Constitution in Goa, tomorrow these people will commit the sin of rejecting it in the entire country,” Modi said at a rally in Chhattisgarh on Wednesday. At a corner meeting in Betalbatim in the Nuvem Assembly segment of South Goa, Fernandes on Monday recalled a discussion on dual citizenship with then Congress president Rahul Gandhi ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He was then a member of a citizens’ collective called “Goencho Awaz (Voice of Goa)”. “We placed 12 demands before him and one of them was regarding dual citizenship. When he asked me if the move was constitutional, I explained to him that the Constitution was adopted in 1950 while Goa was liberated from Portuguese rule only in 1961 and the Constitution was imposed on us. When the Constitution was adopted, Goa was not a part of India,” he said. Fernandes said he told Rahul that Goans acquire Portuguese citizenship due to a lack of jobs in Goa. “They go abroad, support their families and more importantly, they send remittances. Rahul said that I had a point.” Portugal offers those born in Goa before December 19, 1961 — the day Goa was liberated from Portuguese rule — and two future generations the option of registering as its citizens. Since a Portuguese passport provides the holder visa-free entry to several countries, including the United Kingdom and the European Union, many in Goa in the last few decades have been transcribing their births in the Central Registry in Lisbon and acquiring Portuguese citizenship to avail employment and educational opportunities. The issue gained prominence in the past year after Indian authorities stopped issuing surrender certificates, rendering many Goans ineligible for Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status. Earlier this month, two Goans filed petitions in the Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court after their Indian passports were revoked by the regional passport office in Panaji. Hours after Fernandes’s remarks, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant accused him of “undermining the Constitution”. On Wednesday, the BJP filed a complaint with the Goa Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) demanding Fernandes’s disqualification for violating the Model Code of Conduct. It accused Fernandes of having views “that stink of anti-national and divisive mentality, which were detrimental to the democratic and social fabric of the country”. Mormugao BJP MLA Sankalp Amonkar has filed a police complaint against the Congress candidate. Fernandes is a retired naval officer and a Kargil war veteran who received the Vijay Star medal. He was preferred by the Congress over sitting South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha for the polls. He joined the Congress ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls and made his debut from Dabolim, losing out narrowly to the BJP’s Mauvin Godinho. In the parliamentary elections, he will lock horns with Pallavi Dempo, the first woman in Goa to contest the Lok Sabha polls as a BJP nominee. Fernandes told The Indian Express that he did not use the word “forced”. “The Constitution has stood the test of time and has held India together. My only contention is that there should have been some provision or special status to ensure the protection of Goa’s land, culture, and Goan interests. If that had been done, today the Prime Minister and the BJP would not have sold our land and destroyed Goa’s identity. I spoke about safeguarding Goa’s identity,” he said. Accusing Modi of “murdering the Constitution”, he challenged him for a debate on the issue. “You are challenging a soldier who has served for 26 years in the Navy? I have the highest regard for the Constitution and the armed forces. When I joined the Navy, I took an oath on the very Constitution that you are trying to amend,” he said. The Goa Congress has thrown its weight behind Fernandes and accused the BJP of “misinterpreting and doctoring” his speech to mislead people. “He was raising the dual citizenship issue, which had been raised by former Goa CM Manohar Parrikar in the past. Does that make what Parrikar said unconstitutional?” said Goa Congress chief Amit Patkar.

The senior Congress leader has been determined to ensure there is no repeat as Vaibhav contests from Jalore this time. The “revelations” of Gehlot’s former OSD Lokesh Sharma then, days before polling in Jalore on Friday, could not have had worse timing. And they did not take long trickling down to the constituency. Narpat Singh, 61, a retired teacher sitting outside a tea shop in Jalore zila parishad, says that while Vaibhav may be putting up a tough fight still, the BJP is on a strong footing in Jalore. “Moreover, the Congress will lose whatever little support it has among youth because of revelations by Gehlot’s OSD.” On Wednesday, Sharma claimed, among other things, that Gehlot had tried to protect the accused in the paper leaks during his tenure, including the then Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education Chairman Dharmpal Jaroli. The BJP has made the paper leaks a big issue, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a mention of it in his speech in Agra on Thursday, raising Sharma’s claims. Late in the evening, in his first remarks on the “revelations”, Gehlot asked what proof did the PM have. However, in Jalore, some have doubts. If unemployment is a big issue, Narpat says, it is because of paper leaks under the Gehlot government. Ironically, education is one of the common points in political conversations in Jalore, especially since the BJP’s Lumbaram Choudhary, 59, finished his Class 10 only in 2016, while Vaibhav has two degrees from ILS Law College in Pune. Sitting next to Narpat, Shrawan Nath, 38, who hails from the SC Kalbelia caste, says Vaibhav is well-educated and can put forward the constituency’s issues more articulately, unlike Lumbaram. Velaram Sankhla, 49, a member of the same Mali community as the Gehlots, agrees, saying: “The last time this Lok Sabha seat witnessed development was in 1999, when Buta Singh (former Union Home Minister) was an MP from here.” For Hariram Rathore, also a retired teacher, there is another factor at play. Hariram hails from the Rajput community; the remarks by Union minister and BJP candidate from Rajkot, Gujarat, Parshottam Rupala about Rajputs that have triggered protests there have also had a fallout in Jalore, which shares its border with Gujarat. The two candidates have engaged Rajput leaders into the campaign – Vaibhav to cash in on their anger, and Lumbaram to contain the damage. Chandan Singh, 45, a Rajput and former BJP councillor, admits the community is backing Vaibhav. He also questions the BJP decision to replace its sitting MP of 15 years, Devji Patel, with his aide and fellow community member (Kalbi OBC, the largest group in the Jalore seat) as candidate. “Are there no other castes here? And what did Patel do in 15 years?” Singh asks. The BJP has traditionally relied on major OBC groups in Jalore, including Kalbis and Debasis. However, Rajputs too have stood by it. Apart from Rajputs, Vaibhav is relying on consolidation of non-Kalbi OBC castes and SC/STs. A Congress leader says: “OBCs such as Darzi, Nai, Kumhar, Lohar, Mali are now shifting from the BJP towards the Congress… The angry Rajputs too are moving because our MLA from Bheemal here, Samarjit Singh, is a Rajput.” BJP district president Shravan Singh Rao, though, is confident of the party retaining “all the OBC votes” – which he puts at 10 lakh in Jalore – apart from getting the support of Rajputs and Purohits. According to Rao, this is because Vaibhav is an “outsider”. “And when Vaibhav could not win in his home turf with the help of his father as sitting CM, how can he win in Jalore which is a BJP stronghold?” Lumbaram, in contrast, has risen up the ranks, says Rao. “He is a regular person, a farmer. And since he has been a party worker for 40 years, the entire organisation is working for him. People also want to see Modi ji again. Vaibhav’s candidature is a promotion of parivaarvaad (nepotism).” To counter the “outsider” narrative, Vaibhav’s wife Himanshi – apart from their daughter – has been hard at work, promising voters to set up a home in Jalore if he wins, whose doors “will always be open”. But if Lumbaram’s son-of-the-soil narrative is to his advantage, for the youth the fact that at 43, Vaibhav is 26 years younger than the BJP rival, is striking a chord. Then there is Gehlot’s own clout, with the former CM lending his weight along with that of his senior confidants to swing a win. It’s a prestige fight after Vaibhav’s 2019 loss from Jodhpur to senior BJP leader Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, an arch Gehlot rival. Among those looking at Vaibhav are locals Jahangir Khan, 32, and Mohamad Arif, 30, belonging to hardcore Congress families, as well as young government employees on Bagoda Road, who cite the Gehlot government returning to the Old Pension Scheme. “Modi’s craze was in 2014,” one of them says. Jagdish Bansal, who runs a cyber café at the age of 72, has seen worlds change. But there has been one constant, according to him. “The people of Jalore don’t disclose their preferences. And if most of them are saying one of them is winning, then he is certainly going to lose.”      "," The “revelations” of Gehlot’s former OSD Lokesh Sharma then, days before polling in Jalore on Friday, could not have had worse timing.

But the appeal of Modi may be too strong to breach.","Two-time BJP MP Om Birla is facing a tough contest in his Kota Lok Sabha seat, which votes on April 26. One reason is his “absence” from his constituency during his last term, in which he served as the Lok Sabha Speaker. The second is his challenger, the Congress’s Prahlad Gunjal, a former BJP leader and Vasundhara Raje loyalist. “Birla was not seen in the constituency for the last five years. Now that elections are here, he is touring, taking Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s name,” says Mahesh Bairwa, a resident of Rangpur village. Residents say all of Birla’s visits to Kota since 2019 have been restricted to public meetings in the city, with the MP barely touching rural areas. Suresh Meena, a resident of Nayagaon village, who calls himself an “ardent” follower of Modi, says he will vote this time for Gunjal. “He is a powerful leader, connected to the ground, and is contesting elections on local issues.” Gunjal is believed to have left the BJP for the Congress due to growing differences with Birla. The two leaders, who started their political journey at the same time, were caught in a tussle for dominance over the city. As Raje lost his clout in the state unit, so did Gunjal in Kota. The Congress was happy to receive him as it did not have any suitable candidate against Birla. A Congress leader, speaking anonymously, said: “The entry of Gunjal has energised the ranks. Kota was seen as a one-sided competition.” However, the leader said, their main challenge is the enduring appeal of Modi. A few BJP supporters in Barodiya village, for example, say that while they have no love lost for Birla, they will vote for him to get Modi back as PM. Birla’s campaign too has mostly talked about the Modi government’s “achievements”, including Ram Mandir and the abrogation of Article 370. The Congress appears to have bridged some of the gap between the BJP and it here. In 2019, Birla won by more than 2.6 lakh votes. However, in the 2023 Assembly elections, the Congress won four Assembly segments falling in the Kota Lok Sabha seat, the same as the BJP. The Congress is hoping Gunjal will get a majority of the votes of his Gujjar community, plus the Meena tribal and Muslim votes. Along with the three, Rajputs, who have been unhappy with the BJP in the state, and Scheduled Castes are some prominent castes in the area. To help Birla with the Meena voters, their tallest leader in the state and minister Kirori Lal Meena toured Kota. Gunjal told The Indian Express he was thankful to the Congress for accepting him “with open arms”. “There is no place for leadership in the BJP… There were some issues between Om Birla and me. I wanted the senior leadership to resolve them, but they did not pay heed. For my self-respect, I decided to leave the BJP,” Gunjal said, adding that people have been telling him they are “fed up” with the functioning of Birla. “They want change and I am here for that.” However, it has not been all smooth sailing for Gunjal in the Congress, with one of those openly expressing their displeasure being the party’s sitting Kota MLA, Shanti Dhariwal, a known rival of Gunjal. The two have not been seen in public together since a spat between them on stage at a rally. What will help Birla is the BJP’s powerful ground network, and the fact that his fate hangs on how people see Modi. A BJP worker in Kota said that will prove enough. “Birla will win, though the victory margin may be not more than 1 lakh votes.”      "," Two-time BJP MP Om Birla is facing a tough contest in his Kota Lok Sabha seat, which votes on April 26.

A Bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta is scheduled to pronounce its verdict on a batch of pleas seeking the complete cross-verification of votes cast using Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails, or VVPATs. The VVPAT machine is attached to the ballot unit of the EVM and provides visual verification for a voter’s vote by printing a slip of paper with the voter’s choice on it. This is later used to verify votes cast in five randomly selected polling booths per Assembly segment. The Opposition has been demanding that all VVPAT slips be cross-checked with the EVM votes. In context: In recent years, questions have been raised time and again on the integrity of EVMs and the demand to count 100% VVPAT slips is because those in favour of it believe it will make the voting process more transparent. In 2019, when TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu moved the Supreme Court demanding that 50% randomised VVPAT slips be counted — after these proceedings, the court increased the number of polling booths in which the votes would be verified from one to five — the EC had argued it would delay results by five to six days. In December, the Opposition INDIA alliance, which includes the Congress, the CPI(M), the CPI, the Trinamool Congress, the DMK, and the Samajwadi Party, passed a resolution demanding 100% verification of VVPAT slips. They argue that ensuring everyone believes in the fairness of the electoral process outweighs the concerns of a delay in declaring the results.

Several of the constituencies of Nagaon, Diphu, Darrang-Udalguri, Silchar, and Karimganj have undergone significant changes in last year’s delimitation exercise. The decisive role expected to be played by Bengali Muslim voters in this phase has borne an unusual sight. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the BJP’s primary campaigner in Assam — who has in the past declared that the BJP “does not need Miya (a pejorative term for Bengali Muslims) votes in 2024” — has been focusing on the large turnouts at his rallies in Bengali Muslim-majority areas such as Dhing, Laharighat, Rupohi, and Hailakandi. “When elections come, I will myself request them not to vote for us. Vote for us only after you follow family planning, stop child marriage, and shed fundamentalism,” Sarma told reporters last October. On Wednesday, he told a large gathering in Laharighat, a Bengali Muslim majority area in Nagaon, “This is a BJP meeting, you all tell me how many Muslims are here. Outside Assam, people won’t believe that 50,000 Muslims attended a BJP meeting. Today in Assam, everyone has one voice, be it Hindu or Muslim. ‘Ab ki baar, Modi Sarkar (Next time, we will elect a Modi government)’.”  He also claimed that the BJP had given a boost to development “without appeasement”, declaring that the BJP’s welfare schemes were reaching all citizens, including Muslims. The number of Muslim voters – mostly Bengali-speaking – in Nagaon has increased to well over 50% after the three Assembly segments of Dhing, Rupahihat and Samaguri were transferred to it from the erstwhile Kaliabor seat and other segments were removed. Nagaon was sought by multiple Congress ticket aspirants, including, as per reports, Gaurav Gogoi who later contested from Jorhat after sitting Congress MP Prodyut Bordoloi secured the ticket. Against Bordoloi, the BJP has fielded former ULFA militant Suresh Bora who jumped ship from the Congress last year, when he was its Nagaon district president. The Congress won back the seat from the BJP after 20 years when Bordoloi won it in 2019 with a 49.53% vote share. That victory was facilitated by its alliance with Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF, which did not field a candidate in Nagaon in 2019. The AIUDF, which bagged around 25% of the vote share in both 2014 and 2009, has fielded its Dhing MLA Aminul Islam this year after the former allies had a fallout. Bengali-speaking Muslims also make up a decisive number of voters in other constituencies. At Karimganj in the Barak Valley, they are estimated to outnumber Hindu voters by around two lakh. And yet, Karimganj has never had a Muslim MP as it was reserved for SC candidates till the recent delimitation. Now that it is not reserved, the Congress has lined up Hafiz Rashid Ahmed Choudhury, while the AIUDF has fielded Sahabul Islam Choudhury, against the BJP’s sitting MP Kripanath Mallah. Bengali Muslims also make up a significant number of voters in Darrang-Udalguri, formerly the Mangaldoi constituency, and Silchar. In Silchar, a consolidation of the majority Bengali-Hindu vote and a ramshackle Opposition have made the BJP’s Parimal Suklabaidya the frontrunner. In Darrang-Udalguri, sitting BJP MP Dilip Saikia is being challenged by the Congress’s Madhab Rajbangshi and Durgadas Boro of the Bodoland People’s Front. In the autonomous district constituency of Diphu — a hilly, ST-reserved seat the BJP had won in 2019 — the party’s Amarsing Tisso is lined up against Joy Ram Engleng of the Congress, Jotson Bey of the Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC), and Jones Ingti Kathar of the APHPC. All candidates are promising to implement Article 244(A) for the creation of an “autonomous state” within Assam.

While Hindutva is expected to play a role in the western UP constituency, the BJP’s two-term sitting MP and actor-turned-politician Hema Malini is facing a stiff challenge from her opponents, who are calling her “pravasi (outsider)” and “Bambai wali saansad (Mumbai’s MP)” while appealing to the voters to elect a local “brijwasi” this time. The BJP will be hoping to counter the anti-incumbency with its alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) drawing in the Jats. In Mathura, an estimated 45% of the constituency’s population is Jat. But a section of the community too favours local candidates, though according to Malini’s supporters, she is a “Jat bahu” – a reference to her husband and actor Dharmendra, who is a Jat. The BSP candidate Suresh Singh, who belongs to the Jat community, repeatedly reminded voters: “Dhyan rakhiye, apna hi kaam ayega (Keep in mind, only one of your own will help you).” Incidentally, before joining the BSP, Singh had been associated with the VHP. Congress candidate Mukesh Dhangar, who has the support of ally SP, has also attacked the BJP candidate along similar lines saying, “Nahi chahiye pravasi, abki baar brijwasi (We don’t want an outsider, elect a local this time)”. In bid to counter this narrative, Malini is circulating a four-page pamphlet, in which she refers to Mathura as her “karmabhoomi (place of work)”, highlighting the development work undertaken during her two tenures. The sitting MP has also floated the slogan “Viksit Mathura, Hema ki guarantee”, echoing the PM’s “Modi ki guarantee” slogan. Calling it “propaganda”, the BJP’s Mathura media in-charge Shyam Chaturvedi says Malini’s opponents were raising the “outsider” issue because there are no other issues over which to target the BJP. “Hema ji has been associated with Mathura for several decades. Also, since all the public representatives here are of the BJP, they address the public’s problems.” But not everyone in Mathura is convinced. “Malini has got development work done in Mathura, but these are major projects which she planned on her own. She never came to the villages to ask about local problems,” said Preetam Singh, a Jat in the constituency’s Hathoda village. He added that while Hindus want the Krishna Janmasthan to “get a grand shape like the Ram Mandir of Ayodhya”, he will not vote on the issue of temples. “The BJP raises such issues only to polarise voters. Temple will not feed my family. Inflation and unemployment are major problems.” Kishan Singh, a Jat from the same village who had voted for the BJP in 2014 and 2019, said he won’t vote for an “outsider” this time, “Why does the BJP not give opportunity to any local leader who could be available to us?” he said. But for Sulkhan Singh, another Jat from Hathoda, the BJP’s alliance with the RLD decided his vote for him. “Jahan Chaudhary ka parivar, wahan hum (I am always with the family of Chaudhary Charan Singh),” he said. In the Artauni village – which has a mixed population of Jats, Prajapatis (both OBCs) and Jatavs (Dalits) – Nek Shah, a Jat, is impressed with the global standing India achieved under Modi, but adds: “Where are the jobs? The government came with one recruitment scheme, Agniveer, which is useless.” At the Islamiya Market near Mathura’s Deeg Gate area, Kadir Qureshi, 52, who has been unemployed since the slaughter house he worked at shut down after the BJP came to power in UP in 2017, said: “Hindus – especially youths – proudly say the BJP government has oppressed Muslims.” On the ongoing Shahi Idgah dispute, Qureshi said, “Ram Mandir has already been built. Now they have entered Gyanvapi and started worship in a sealed cellar. They will do the same in Mathura too. Hindus will get this too if the BJP continues in power,” he said, adding he will vote for the candidate who put up a fight against the BJP. But among other voters, there is a desire to see a temple at the disputed site. Umesh Singh, a Thakur and businessman living nearby believes it is certain that if Modi gets a third term and the BJP comes to power in UP in 2027, a temple will be built at the Krishna Janmasthan. Bhoori Devi, 65, a street vendor near the premises of the Shahi Idgah, said, “I have been seeing a mosque since I came here from Rajasthan after marriage 40 years ago. I believe one day a grand temple will be built in Mathura.” In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Malini had defeated the RLD’s Kunwar Narendra Singh by 2.93 lakh votes. At the time, the RLD had an alliance with the SP and BSP. The Congress’s Mahesh Pathak had got only 28,084 votes. In the 2022 Assembly polls, when the RLD and SP were in an alliance, the BJP had won all the five Assembly segments in the Mathura Lok Sabha constituency. The BJP is confident of a 2019 repeat. “Mathura is a safe seat for the BJP. The RLD is also with us this time,” said Shyam Chaturvedi, the BJP’s Mathura media in-charge.       "," The construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya has instilled faith in the voters of Mathura that the BJP governments under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will see the dispute over the city’s Shahi Idgah mosque complex and the Krishna Janmasthan resolved in the courts, just as it has for the Ayodhya dispute. While Hindutva is expected to play a role in the western UP constituency, the BJP’s two-term sitting MP and actor-turned-politician Hema Malini is facing a stiff challenge from her opponents, who are calling her “pravasi (outsider)” and “Bambai wali saansad (Mumbai’s MP)” while appealing to the voters to elect a local “brijwasi” this time."

The small-scale industries here have also got a lot of help from Mudra Yojana,” Modi said. In the narrow lanes of Aligarh where the lock industry and its ancillary units operate – “Yahan har ghar mein taala banta hai (Here every house makes locks)”, the saying goes – such promises are yet to trickle down. Anis Ahmad, one of the biggest lock manufacturers here, with a unit in Shah Jamal in Old Aligarh, overrun by overflowing drains, garbage heaps and hanging overhead electric wires, says MSMEs like theirs are lagging behind. “Government policies favour only big businesses.”  However, sitting in his office at his two-floor factory, as the sound of clanging machines trickles in, the 40-year-old adds that they don’t know much else to do. “Yeh hamare khoon mein hai (Lock-making is in our blood). Every generation passes on the knowledge to the next. However, most of those employed in it are not educated, and are unorganised and very poor; they know the technique of making locks, but they do not know how to market it or to get the benefits of government policies.” Ahmad says they are also worried about the administration’s plan to move the lock units to industrial areas like Tala Nagri, citing “violation” of norms. “How will a small unit buy land there?… Why uproots thousands of people? Yahan ek dusre ki chain fansi hui hai (People are dependent on each other here),” he says, while showing how “70 types of items” go into making a single padlock. Mohammad Azharuddin, who now runs his father’s electroplating business, which is an important component of lock manufacturing, says that while PM Modi to Opposition leaders mention Aligarh locks in their speech, the industry’s issues don’t figure among the concerns of any one. “We have no union, no leader. Jab hum doctor ko apni pareshani batayenge hi nahin, toh woh ilaaj kaise karega (If we are not able to tell a doctor our problem, how can he treat us)?” Azharuddin says, adding that Gujarat towns such as Rajkot and Jamnagar are now coming up as big players in the business, “only because they work together”. “I wonder if any person here has even heard that the lock industry is part of the Uttar Pradesh government’s ODOP scheme.” Azharuddin admits that a lot of hesitation towards the authorities is on account of the grey zone in which the units operate, but pointing to their rising input costs now, and adds: “If the government thinks of this work as heritage, they should give attention to the people involved in it.” Shubhamraj Varshney, who runs a lock shop in the Madar gate area of Aligarh, says the rising costs of inputs are hard to explain. “Some say it is due to the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Palestine wars. However I don’t think that is true. The raw materials do not come from these countries.” Birendra Kumar, Joint Commissioner of Industries, Aligarh, says the district has around 5,000 units registered under the ‘Locks and Ancillary’ category. “The yearly turnover is over Rs 10,000 crore. Around 1.5 lakh people are involved. The ODOP scheme consists of several components: finance, where a maximum subsidy of Rs 20 lakh is given for a loan of Rs 2 crore; a 10-day special training programme for artisans, with the provision of tool kits; and marketing development assistance to manufacturers, including subsidies to set up stalls at trade fairs and exhibitions,” says Kumar. Satish Gautam, the BJP’s two-time Aligarh MP, fielded again by the party, also talks about the ODOP scheme as the answer. Admitting that the woes of the industry were not a poll issue, Gautam refers to PM Modi’s speech to say it is very much on the BJP government’s mind. “Manufactures are already benefiting from the ODOP scheme, we will increase its coverage in the third term.” Gautam has won the last two times by margins of over two lakh votes. Facing him this time are the SP’s Bijendra Singh and the BSP’s Hitendra Upadhyay. In 2019, Gautam got 56.42% of the votes, with the BSP’s Ajeet Baliyan a distant second with 36.71%. The Congress got merely 4.37% votes.

Inside the chamber of the party’s district chief Rajendra Maske there, a smiling portrait of Maharashtra BJP stalwart late Gopinath Munde adorns a wall as people breeze in and out of the busy office. The Beed Lok Sabha constituency is witnessing a straight fight between BJP leader and ex-minister Pankaja Munde, daughter of Gopinath Munde, and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar)’s candidate Bajrang Sonwane. A prominent Vanjari (OBC) face, Pankaja had been estranged from the BJP for some time, but the party has now placated her by fielding her from her home turf. She has replaced her younger sister Pritam Munde, the two-time MP, who had joined politics after the death of their father in 2014. Interestingly, Pawar has again chosen to field Sonwane, a Maratha face, although he was defeated by Pritam in 2019 by 1.68 lakh votes. In the NCP(SP)’s Beed office, the makeover following the split in the party looks complete with its new name painted in bold along with the symbol of a “man blowing tutari (trumpet)”. Beed is one of the eight districts in the Marathwada region, which has been the epicentre of an intense agitation over the last several months for quotas for Marathas in jobs and education, which led to counter-protests by the OBCs. The ruling Mahayuti alliance comprising Chief Minister Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the BJP and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP finally passed a new law in the state legislature in February this year to extend 10% separate reservation to Marathas. It has been challenged in the Bombay High Court, where the matter has now been pending. Beed is among the most backward districts in Maharashtra, which provides almost 70% of farm labourers to economically prosperous sugar region of Western Maharashtra. The elections in Beed this time, many believe, may be influenced significantly by the Maratha quota issue, which has also snowballed into a conflict between Marathas and OBCs. The face of the Maratha quota stir, Manoj Jarange-Patil, who hails from Jalna in Marathwada, has rejected the Shinde government’s Maratha quota law, insisting that it must be provided under the OBC category. He has sought Kunbhi certificates for all Marathas to facilitate it. The long-standing standoff is said to have alienated a section of the Maratha community from the Mahayuti coalition while causing polarisation on the caste lines. After filing her nomination Wednesday, Pankaja expresses her disappointment. “In the Lok Sabha polls one expects discussion on national issues. I feel sad it’s not happening even in my constituency,” she says. Apart from Beed, the quota row has also gained traction in seven other constituencies in the drought-prone region, which include Aurangabad, Jalna, Hingoli, Nanded, Latur, Parbhani and Osmanabad. The slogan of “Ek Maratha lakh Maratha (one Maratha is equal to lakh Marathas)” has been raised with renewed aggression at rallies in rural Marathwada, which has been reeling under an agrarian crisis due to recurring unseasonal rains. In several OBC-dominated belts, the community activists have come up with their own counter-slogan, pointing out that their share in the state’s population is 50-52% as compared to Marathas’ 28-30%. While the Mahayuti camp believes that OBCs would rally behind them, the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP (SP) and Congress is looking to consolidate Marathas, Muslims and Dalits to expand their vote base. The Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA)’s president Prakash Ambedkar, who has also fielded some candidates in the region, said, “The polarisation in Marathwada is dangerous. The Maratha-OBC division has penetrated down to the mohalla level. This does not auger well for democracy.” If Jarange Patil has sought to connect with Marathas, especially the poor and lower middle class who are marginal farmers and farm labourers, NCP leader and minister Chaggan Bhujbal has positioned himself as a champion of the OBC cause. Bhujbal said, “I had to take a firm stand for OBCs after Maratha protesters torched the houses and commercial establishments of OBC people. Their demand for reservation within OBC quota cannot be accepted. The government has given them 10% separate reservation.” A businessman and OBC activist, Subash Raut, whose hotel in Beed was set on fire by a mob during the Maratha protests last year, laments, “During elections, parties often use caste as a strategy to consolidate their votes. But what we notice now is ugly casteism unleashed at unprecedented levels.” Many believe that the caste polarisation in the wake of the Maratha quota stir may result in turning this election as a neck-and-neck contest between the two alliances in the Marathwada region. Sayyed Arbaz, who runs a garage at Georai along the Beed highway, says, “In Marathwada, Gopinath Munde was an exception who broke the stereotypes and got Muslim votes despite being in BJP. Whether this will happen in current situation and to what extent I cannot hazard a guess. But personally, I believe there is goodwill about Munde family among Muslims.” In the 2019 polls, when the BJP contested in an alliance with the then undivided Shiv Sena, they had swept Marathwada. While the BJP won four seats – Beed, Jalna, Latur and Nanded – the Sena got three – Hingoli, Parbhani and Osmanabad – with the AIMIM picking the Aurangabad seat. Unlike 2019, the AIMIM and VBA are no longer allies this time. The Dalit factor may also play a significant role in determining the electoral outcome in the region, with the SC communities making up about 11% population of the state. The MVA is raking up their “threat to Constitution” charge to win over Dalits. A Parbhani resident Sandeep Ghade says, “With multiple parties and coalitions as well as the splits in Shiv Sena and NCP, people have lost faith in parties and leaders. In the absence of ideologies, caste politics seems to be an easy transition.” The Mahayuti is hoping PM Modi’s campaign would help them counter any public sympathy in favour of Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar over the splits in their respective parties. Hingoli, Parbhani and Nanded will go to polls in the second phase on April 26, Latur and Osmanabad on May 7, and Beed, Jalna and Aurangabad on May 13. In Parbhani, the Rashtriya Samaj Party’s Mahadev Jankar, a Mahayuti ally, is taking on the Sena (UBT)’s sitting MP Sanjay Jadhav. Hingoli is witnessing a battle between the Shiv Sena’s Baburao Kohalikar and the Sena (UBT)’s Nagesh Ashtikar. In the SC-reserved Latur, there is a straight fight between the BJP’s Sudhakar Shrungare and the Congress’s Shivaji Kalge. Osmanabad will see a face-off between the Sena (UBT)’s sitting MP Omraje Nimbalkar amd the NCP’s Archana Patil. The stage is set in Jalna for a fight between BJP MP and Union minister Raosaheb Danve and the Congress’s Kalyan Kale. In Aurangabad, the contest is triangular involving the AIMIM’s sitting MP Imtiaz Jaleel, Sandipan Bhumre (Shiv Sena) and Chandrakant Khaire (Sena-UBT).      "," The Beed Lok Sabha constituency is witnessing a straight fight between BJP leader and ex-minister Pankaja Munde, daughter of Gopinath Munde, and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar)’s candidate Bajrang Sonwane.

On the face of it, Jonny Bairstow is a curious player. When he doesn’t click he can be very frustrating to watch. But when he does, just like he did on Friday night at the Eden Gardens, there’s rarely a cleaner hitter of the ball in T20s. After returning to the Punjab’s starting XI after being dropped for the last two matches, the English opener smashed the KKR pace battery to smithereens. He took 24 runs off the last over of the powerplay as Punjab reached 93/1 after the first 6 overs, improving upon their KKR counterparts’ 76/0 in the first innings.And the chase was well and truly on. Bairstow would not relent as the innings progressed, getting to his 50 from 23 balls as he all but silenced a 55k-strong home crowd at the iconic Eden Gardens. With the pace attack faltering, Shreyas Iyer introduced Varun Chakaravarthy but the opener would not be denied, as he nonchalantly hit the mystery spinner for 17 runs in the 11th over as Punjab brought up their 150 in the very next one. Even the usually potent Andre Russell wasn’t safe from the Bairstow blitzkrieg as he smashed 24 runs off the 12th over and then brought up his ton in 45 deliveries. He was ably supported by Shashank Singh with whom Bairstow brought up a 50-run partnership off just 27 deliveries as Punjab reached the target of 262 with eight balls to spare, making it the highest successful run chase in all T20s. Shashank, who has been the find of the season for Punjab, also did his part with a quickfire 67 off 27 after Rilee Rossouw was dismissed in the 13th over for 26. With his innings, which came at a crucial stage when Bairstow was appearing to run out of gas, ensured there was no comeback for Kolkata. Earlier, it was Prabhsimran Singh who started it all, bringing up his half century in just 18 balls before being run out as Punjab went all hell for leather from the word go in the chase of a steep target. In a hot, sticky, energy-sapping evening in Kolkata, Punjab Kings skipper Sam Curran chose to have a bowl after winning the toss. But his bowlers were bled dry by Kolkata’s opening pair Sunil Narine and Phil Salt, who brought up a 138-run partnership. To make matters worse, the Punjab bowlers weren’t helped by some really subpar fielding which saw both openers dropped thrice inside the first 10 overs. Since getting promoted to the opener slot again this season, opposition attacks are yet to find a way to stop the carnage from Narine. Even the best player of the 2022 T20 World Cup, Curran felt his wrath when he saw the first delivery he bowled to Narine getting slashed for a four. Same happened with Arshdeep Singh in the second over as the West Indies all-rounder nonchalantly pulled him for a six over square leg. He would reach his half century in just 23 balls before ultimately getting dismissed for 71 off Rahul Chahar. His knock had four sixes and nine boundaries. The carnage continued with his opening partner Phil Salt, who after quiet first 2 overs where he scored 2 runs from 5, signalled his intent by smashing Harshal Patel for two sixes and a four, marauding 18 from the third over. Even Kagiso Rabada wasn’t spared as both openers made him look absolutely ordinary with KKR reaching 50 in just 3.5 overs, 21 runs of which came from his first over. As the powerplay ended, Kolkata had reached 76/0 with Punjab already having a huge mountain to scale. From there on with their fielders not making it any easy, Punjab’s attack struggled to stream to the run flow as Kolkata’s 100 came up in the 8th over. The Englishman would also get his half century off just 25 as the hapless Punjab bowlers searched for a breakthrough. In all, Salt six sixes and as many boundaries. There wasn’t any let up for Punjab as the evening progressed with the bowlers gradually losing the plot as Kolkata batsmen made merry, posting 137/0 after 10 overs. Curran would strike in the 13th over, cleaning up Salt for 75 but the flow of runs was not stemmed with KKR opting to send Andre Russell up the order at number 4. The burly striker would start his innings by playing a well-timed shot which required him to arch his body and send the delivery to the third man boundary. He would build on that with a six off the 15th over bowled by Harpreet Brar as Punjab’s strategy to stifle KKR in the middle overs didn’t really pan out. Russell survived a thick edge which wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma failed to catch and it reached the boundary to bring up KKR’s 200 in the 16th over. The West Indies allrounder would perish in the very same over, having made24 off 12. Shreyas Iyer would replace him in the middle scoring 28 off 10 deliveries with three sixes and a four off the 18th before falling in the next one. The Knights would ultimately post 261/6, the highest-ever IPL score at the Eden Gardens. But little did they know at the half-way stage that the record would be surpassed within a couple of hours and eight balls to spare.

His partner and chief architect of the chase, Jonny Bairstow soon embraced. In a trice, ecstatic teammates piled on in cathartic joy. It has been a difficult season for Punjab Kings, having lost six of their eight encounters before this. But here they pulled off the highest run chase ever in this format, with eight balls to spare no less. The Eden Gardens crowd stood and stared shocked, wanting to celebrate the moment yet mourn their team’s defeat. They recovered from the initial jolt and gamely applauded Punjab Kings. A gutted Shreyas Iyer, the KKR captain, would tell the host broadcasters: “Both teams played tremendously. You have to go back to the drawing board and see where you went wrong. Not defending hurts but it’s a great lesson for the players.” Shashank, who leathered 68 off 28 balls, choked for words as he explained his methods. It was just another league game, but the mood was akin to a big knockout match that had just gotten over. Then again, every day, teams don’t chase down 262 in this format. It’s a night to celebrate the game as much as the record chase. .@PunjabKingsIPL are roaring again 🦁 A special victory at the Eden Gardens for #PBKS who secure the highest successful run chase in the IPL and T20s ❤️ Scorecard ▶️ https://t.co/T9DxmbgIWu#TATAIPL | #KKRvPBKS pic.twitter.com/FNxVD8ZeW6 — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 26, 2024 Prabhsimran Singh had developed an unfortunate habit. Frequently used as the Impact Player by Punjab Kings, he almost always comes out to bat, goes bang-bang, then gets out in the 20s and 30s. Of the 8 innings before Friday night in Kolkata, Prabhsimran crossed 19 five times but didn’t cross 35. At Eden Gardens though, he seemed to put it right in some style. He took Punjab to a blistering start, smashing Harshit Rana, Dushmantha Chameera, Anukul Roy in the powerplay. Then came Sunil Narine, and Prabhsimran welcomed him with a four and six. The 20-ball 54 was a brilliant knock… but it came to an end with a run out at the end of 24-run over. Jonny Bairstow smashed Anukul Roy 4-6-4-4-6 but off the last ball, took off for a single that saw Prabhsimran fall short thanks to a Narine direct hit. As he walked off, he put the bat face close to his helmet grille and roared in frustration. A soft end after a stunning start. Sam Curran has developed so many slower-ball variations that he rarely nudged 130kph, let alone 140 which once he regularly clocked. But for once, he was forced to rev up his pace and was indeed rewarded. Phil Salt had clouted him for a pair of flat sixes, both off slower balls. The first one hovered around the 115kph mark, the second even slower at 109 kph. Salt would judge the length and just swing through the line. Curran had already conceded 30 runs in 14 balls and he wanted a shot at redemption. He reverted to his biggest strength, that is to bowl a yorker at full-pelt. The ball only measured 131 clicks on the speedo, but it was pinpoint accurate. The ball drifted in a tad from his wrists, and upon landing, block-hole or thereabouts straightened to blast the off-stump. The batsman was beaten chiefly for pace. Perhaps this is his new trick—reverse the routine. Batsmen are expecting him to take the pace off the ball. So slip one faster, and beat them for pace. It worked. Punjab Kings needed to break the KKR opening partnership early. Phil Salt and Sunil Narine have been key to Kolkata’s fast starts eventually ending up in big totals but with their all-out attacking approach, there is also the downside of giving opportunities for the opponents. Punjab actually did well to create these chances. But unfortunately, they came to Eden Gardens with butter fingers. Narine was dropped by Harpreet Brar as early as the third over. Then Salt was put down twice, one an absolute sitter by Sam Curran. The openers went on to add 138 for the first wicket. Then Andre Rusell was given a life too. A smart field placement saw Arshdeep bowl with a fine fly slip but the outside edge that was heading straight into the hands, but gloved away by a diving Jitesh Sharma. Fortunately, this time around, DreRuss was out the next ball as Arshdeep bowled a bouncer. Harshal did take the catch this time. In an otherwise all-out attacking approach KKR have adopted for this season, Shreyas Iyer has been going slow in the middle order. After starting the season with a 24-ball 39, Shreyas either played short cameos or dropped anchor. There was a 32-ball 34, a 38-ball 38 and a 36-ball 50 thrown into the mix. So it was a little bit of a surprise that he came out to bat in the 16h over when DreRuss got out. The first thought was it would have been the ideal entry point for finisher Rinku Singh. But after struggling with the short balls early on, Shreyas went out all guns blazing this time around. He smashed a 10-ball 28, with intent to go big without taking his time to settle in. Sure, the match situation helped but still, it was a welcome display of aggression from the KKR captain that hasn’t been seen too frequently this year. Amidst Shreyas Iyer’s carnage of Sam Curran—6,4, 6, 6— one stroke stood out for its impossible trajectory. The second six, a flick that was both brutal and beautiful. Iyer had premeditated and moved across, assuming that Curran would spear a wide yorker. But he bowled full on middle and leg stump. So Iyer had to readjust. He did so by keeping his front-leg upright, his back knee bent a touch, careful that it did not slide further away, which could have obstructed the path of the bat. It was an awkward pose, but he kept his poise, and let those malleable wrists twist and close and take the ball to the stands over deep midwicket, all the while standing tall and not bending forward as most batsmen naturally do when flicking, Watch out for the snapping wrists, that imparts direction onto the ball. Iyer loved the shot, as he watched it’s stand-ward ascent.

"," But here they pulled off the highest run chase ever in this format, with eight balls to spare no less. The Eden Gardens crowd stood and stared shocked, wanting to celebrate the moment yet mourn their team’s defeat. A gutted Shreyas Iyer, the KKR captain, would tell the host broadcasters: “Both teams played tremendously. Not defending hurts but it’s a great lesson for the players.” Shashank, who leathered 68 off 28 balls, choked for words as he explained his methods. Then again, every day, teams don’t chase down 262 in this format."

He turned behind and celebrated, pointing to his teammates who soon mobbed him in the middle. A new World Champion was crowned, and India became only the sixth different country to lift the prestigious Thomas Cup since its inception in 1949. In Chengdu, starting Saturday, the Band of Brothers that triumphed in Bangkok, will begin their campaign to defend that title. It is almost entirely the same set of players who are tasked with that challenge. The group believed they are capable of winning the title much before Bangkok 2022 as the now-famous Whatsapp group ‘It’s coming home!’ was created. A medal seemed possible from the word go, but they defied the odds to go all the way, blanking the most successful side in the history of the tournament in the final. Now, as champions, they will have a target on their backs. Winning it once was a big deal, defending the title is going to be much tougher in what seems to be a very open race too. Hosts China will go all out, Indonesia will be raring to put 2022 behind them and have players hitting some terrific form, Denmark and Japan will fancy their chances too and watch out for Chinese Taipei, who are capable of doing what India did last time. India will again be in the mix. Indian badminton found its love for team events at the last Thomas Cup and talent wise, there is no reason to put a repeat past them. Coach Vimal Kumar, who hailed it as the country’s greatest achievement, said that day it was “an achievement of pure team spirit which I haven’t seen in the past.” India have boasted of some star singles players over the last two decades, but to come together in a team event like they did was a sensational achievement. Since then, there have been medals in other team events too like the Asian Games men’s team event and the Badminton Asia Team Championships. 𝗟𝗢𝗢𝗞𝗕𝗔𝗖𝗞: 2⃣0⃣2⃣2⃣ #ThomasUberCupFinals#ThomasCup 𝙁𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙡 This is how 🇮🇳 sealed their first-ever triumph in the competition. 👏 pic.twitter.com/tEqdDkAeGp — BWF (@bwfmedia) April 26, 2024 While the personnel India will be employing over the next few days is simliar, the roles are likely to be rejigged. HS Prannoy’s presence as the third singles player was a crucial factor in Bangkok, but this time he is the top-ranked Indian singles player and will have to shoulder a different, tougher burden. If picked, he will play the opponent’s toughest players. While at his best, Prannoy can beat anyone in the world – even Viktor Axelsen, as he has shown in the last few years – his 2024 has been off to a rough start. With older health issues resurfacing, he hasn’t hit the highs of 2023, although the signs were good at the Asian Championships. Lakshya Sen was flying high in 2022, but things have not been easy for him since. His Paris 2024 dreams looked distant at the start of this year, but the Almora kid climbed this hill in the nick of time, putting together crucial runs in Europe. In 2022, Srikanth Kidambi played arguably the best badminton of his career since the remarkable 2017 season, going undefeated in Bangkok. This time – if picked as the third singles player – he will have to overcome patchy form and step up under high pressure in deciding fifth matches. Priyanshu Rajawat was a rookie in Bangkok as he soaked in the experience, but is now more than a viable option for the third singles slot, should India seek to rotate. In men’s doubles, MR Arjun and Dhruv Kapila’s fortunes nosedived post-2022 mostly due to injuries, but they have hit some good form recently. The one thing that hasn’t changed, however, is the form of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, if anything they have gone on to become world-beaters. Currently world No 3, SatChi will have to spearhead India’s challenge as a bankable win in every tie they play. India’s opponents in Group C will first be Kunlavut Vitidsarn-led Thailand. The world champion could well give his side a winning start but the depth on paper is much better for India, with Thailand not having their best second singles or main doubles options. England is next, and that should be winnable too. Then comes the grudge match against Indonesia, who have their main singles players Jonatan Christie and Anthony Ginting in great form, and despite their legendary doubles players missing, possess great depth there too. Being played so close to Paris 2024, there is also the question of how much teams will push in Chengdu. Some teams have withdrawn, while others have not sent their full strength teams (like Indian women in the Uber Cup). But, Race to Paris now in the rearview mirror, India have made their intentions for Thomas Cup clear by opting for the big guns. And at a team event, all it could take is a spark, leaning on teammates to overturn tough situations. The early signs are similar in Chengdu as in Bangkok, as the team has been projecting confidence and team spirit. “Rok sako toh rok lo,” seems to be the rallying cry. Even though defending the famous trophy will be daunting, the group that made history are striking a defiant note. Indian women gained automatic qualification for the Uber Cup 2024 Finals after a sensational week at the Badminton Asia Team Championships in Malaysia earlier this year. A semifinal spot would have assured them their spot but they went the distance to clinch the title, overcoming a series of higher-ranked opponents. That title, albeit in a depleted field, was a shot in the arm for the women’s badminton contingent in the country, where the big wins have often come in individual tournaments. It marked PV Sindhu’s comeback to action from an injury break, but was made memorable by Anmol Kharb’s incredible arrival on the big stage. But in Chengdu, as Uber Cup gets underway on Saturday, India will unlikely build on that success in Shah Alam. A medal at the World Team Championships wouldn’t have been easy anyway, but it became improbable when Sindhu, Tanisha Crasto-Ashwini Ponnappa, Treesa Jolly-Gayatri Gopichand opted out. “Sindhu informed the selectors that due to back-to-back tournaments leading up to the Olympics, she and her team have decided to skip the Uber Cup to prepare for the Olympics Top doubles pairs also cited similar reasons and, since it is not a full-strength team, they also pulled out. The selectors then decided to go ahead with young players who have done well recently at the National Championships,” BAI had said in a statement while announcing the squad. And so the mercurial lefty Ashmita Chaliha will lead a young Indian team, that could still stand an outside chance at getting out of Group A in second place. China will be the overwhelming favourites in the group but against Canada and Singapore, India can’t be written off. The crucial tie would be the opener on Saturday against Michelle Li’s Canada. National champion Anmol, who stole headlines at BATC, will get another chance to go toe-to-toe with some more higher-ranked opponents while Tanvi Sharma is another teenager to keep an eye out on. Shruti Mishra-Priya Konjengbam and Simran Singhi-Ritika Thaker will shoulder doubles responsibilities. Thomas Cup squad: (Singles) HS Prannoy, Lakshya Sen, Kidambi Srikanth, Priyanshu Rajawat and Kiran George (Doubles) Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, Chirag Shetty, MR Arjun, Dhruv Kapila and Sai Pratheek Uber Cup squad: (Singles) Anmol Kharb, Tanvi Sharma, Ashmita Chaliha and Isharani Baruah (Doubles) Shruti Mishra, Priya Konjengbam, Simran Singhi and Ritika Thaker     "," Hosts China will go all out, Indonesia will be raring to put 2022 behind them and have players hitting some terrific form, Denmark and Japan will fancy their chances too and watch out for Chinese Taipei, who are capable of doing what India did last time.

That is just 16 and a half balls every game. It is not a wow stat. Except when you consider that he has smeared every fifth ball (5.07) over the fence, often landing in the stands. It indeed is a wow stat, because it’s six-hitting frequency that betters the best six-hitters in this business. The most ferocious six-striker of our times, the semi-retired Chris Gayle, smacked one every nine-and-a-half balls he faced in T20s; the Indian maharaja of maximums, Rohit Sharma buried one every 16th ball. Certainly, their careers span almost as long as Abhishek’s age (23). They have traversed the breadth of this world, tamed varied climes and bowlers. Abhishek is in the nascence of his career, yet to feature in one full season of the league, and four short of 100 T20 games. Gayle has played 10 times more than him; Rohit five-fold. Abhishek might or might not scale such lofty peaks. Before that he would have to maintain this season after season, and prove he is not a one-season wonder. Yet, he has become an unputdownable watch this season. In the company of Travis Head, who by the way pummels a six every 8.5 balls, he has teed off Sunrisers Hyderabad to supersonic starts. The pair has, in their daring and relish, dusted up memories of another time and format when Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana ripped new-ball bowlers apart to maximise the 15-over field restrictions in the 1996 ODI World Cup. If Head is the equivalent of Sanath Jayasuriya, Abhishek has been something of a Kaluwitharana, accomplice rather than an understudy.
Then it’s not so much about how many Abhishek hits as it is about how he hits them. He makes it all look like the most natural thing in the world, as though it wouldn’t have occurred to him to play any other way. There are few twiddles and fiddles as he takes strike, always with half a smile, as though he is passing his gentle greetings to the bowler before he subjects them to violence. There are no awkward shuffles or trigger movements, as is often the case with batsmen bred in Delhi and Punjab. Perhaps when you are as gifted as Abhishek at seeing and hitting a cricket ball, everything else is window dressing. He is still at the crease watching the ball with hawkish eyes and waiting for it to reach him. Only when he has processed the ball and the response — the length, line and the most productive stroke — would he commit. The feet then move nimbly, yet firmly. His movements are definite. The heart of his batting is his bat-swing — as it was with his mentor Yuvraj Singh and idol Brian Lara. It descends from a height like a crisp, clinical swish of the sword, generating an eye-twitching bat-speed. The two elements breathe timing and power into his shots. Even the follow-through is smooth and simple. He rarely falls over in the shuddering impact of the ball on bat. Leg-side predilection is evident. As do most six-hitters. As many as 23 of 26 maximums were hits on the leg. Of them, 16 were dispatched between midwicket and long-on. It could misconstrue an impression that he slogs his way to sixes. He does slog, but that’s not his most productive stroke. A lot of them are flick, lofted drives (especially of spinners) and pulls. The leg-side skew could also be because he often targets spinners rather than seamers for big shots (spinners account for 16 of them). He is a ruthless destroyer of spinners, not sparing even the finest of them, Kuldeep Yadav and Rashid Khan. A six off Rashid stands out — he shimmied down the track and lofted his googly over long-off. Kuldeep was carted for three sixes in an over, twice using his feet to reach the pitch of the ball. Against seamers, he resorts to the more conventional drives and uses the horizontal bat only when the ball is short. As his six-scything rages on, whispers of him waltzing into the consciousness of selectors, who would soon pick the squad for the World T20, have gathered girth. Abhishek himself was shocked when the question was put across to him recently. “If start thinking about selection and having a breakthrough IPL season, then my focus might be lost,” he had said. He is not yet ripe to barge into the squad that is well-stocked at the top. But he certainly is a glint in the corner of the selectors’ eyes, one for the future. His talents are rare — a new-age left-handed batsman who could belt sixes from the first ball he faces and bat anywhere in the order. There is a less-utilised skill of his too, bowling. He could bowl orthodox left-arm and possess a seamer’s leg-cutter of sorts. But that skill would only be an add-on, when compared to his incredible six-hitting prowess, the most precious currency in T20 cricket.

Chahal, who made his debut in 2016, has yet to feature in a T20 World Cup, having missed out on both the 2021 and 2022 editions of the showpiece event. He also backed young uncapped seamer Harshit Rana, who has excelled with the Kolkata Knight Riders this season. The 22-year-old Delhi bowler has picked up nine wickets from five outings thus far. With the wicket-keepers’ tussle hotting up, Yuvraj said it would be wiser for India to back younger keepers in Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson rather than turning back to Dinesh Karthik who has rekindled his finishing capabilities with the Royal Challengers Bengaluru this IPL season. Karthik started the last T20 World Cup in Australia as India’s designated keeper before losing his spot ahead of the team’s semifinal defeat to England. “DK (Karthik) has been batting well, but the thing with DK is the last time (2022) they picked him and the T20 WC was on he didn’t get to play. If DK is not in your XI I don’t think there is any point in picking him. “There is Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson and both guys are in great form and obviously they are younger,” Yuvraj stated. Yuvraj, best remembered for his iconic six sixes in an over against Stuart Broad in the 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa, backed Suryakumar Yadav to be India’s critical gamechanger in the first 20-team World Cup alongside pace ace Jasprit Bumrah. “Suryakumar Yadav (is India’s key player) because the way he plays, he can change the complexion of a game in 15 balls. I think Jasprit Bumrah is also the key with the bowling and I would like to see a leg-spinner in the squad as well, like Yuzvendra Chahal as he has been bowling really well. “But being a batter, I would say Suryakumar Yadav (is the key player).” India open their campaign on June 5, nine days after the IPL 2024 season, facing Ireland at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. Pakistan, Canada and co-hosts United States complete India’s group.      "," “These guys (Rohit and Virat have been great players for India and they deserve to go (retire) when they want,” Yuvraj said. “I would like to see more younger players in the T20 format, because it gets the load off them (experienced players) playing 50-over (ODIs) and Test matches. “After this (T20) World Cup I would like to see a lot of younger guys come into the team and make the T20 side for the next World Cup,” Yuvraj told ICC. There are a lot of other guys who have been playing for a while now, but I would like to see Shivam Dube in the mix.” In terms of spin-bowling options, Yuvraj also backed veteran leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, India’s leading wicket-taker in the format to bolt into the squad."

Sam Curran won the toss and put Shreyas Iyer's side into bat first","Kolkata Knight Riders vs Punjab Kings IPL 2024 highlights: Jonny Bairstow’s 100 ensured Punjab Kings would create history at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Friday by chasing the highest total ever by an IPL side in the history of competition against the Kolkata Knight Riders. Alongside Bairstow, Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh chipped in with valuable contributions to make the improbable possible. Apart from Sunil Narine, it has been a sorry-looking bowling card yet again for KKR. KKR is currently second in the 10-team table with 10 points, four behind table toppers Rajasthan Royals (14 points) and the team’s success is largely due to the batting efforts from the top-order. Follow live score and updates of KKR vs PBKS from Kolkata below.  Very pleasing. Most importantly the win. Cricket is turning into baseball. We have had a few tough weeks. But we hung in there. The way guys train. The confidence and the coaches. The small grounds and the dew. The reviews which might give you an extra ball. We hung in there and managed to chase it down with balls to spare. Pleased for Johnny. What an amazing knock. Shashank Singh has been the find of the tournament for us. Ashutosh as well. Proud of everyone. “Save the bowlers” someone plsss
??? #KKRvsPBKS #IPL2024 Sandip G: Smuggling a single, Shashank Singh leapt and punched the air. His partner and chief architect of the chase, Jonny Bairstow soon embraced. In a trice, ecstatic teammates piled on in cathartic joy. It  has been a difficult season for Punjab Kings, having lost six of their eight encounters before this. But here they pulled the highest run chase ever in this format, with eight balls to spare no less. The Eden Gardens crowd stood and stared shocked, wanting to celebrate the moment yet mourn their team’s defeat. They recovered from the initial jolt and gamely applauded Punjab Kings. A gutted Shreyas Iyer, the KKR captain, would tell the hosts broadcasters: “Both teams played tremendously. You have to go back to the drawing board and see where you went wrong. Not defending hurts but it's a great lesson for the players.” Shashank, who leathered 68 off 28 balls, choked for words as he explained his methods. It was just another league game, but the mood was akin to a big knockout match that had just gotten over. Then every day, teams don’t chase down 262 in this format. It’s a night to celebrate the game as much as the record chase. It is ironical the match ended as after all the carnage of boundaries it was a quick single that gave Punjab Kings this historic win. Jonny Bairstow has been the anchor of the chase for lack of better words the likes of Prabhsimran and Shashank in the end did their cameo bit. As per KKR bowlers, there is a lot of work to be done with regards to their bowling.  Nine runs are needed from two overs in a normal game it would have looked fine but given the context of the chase, this is remarkable for Punjab. It will take some time to sync in for both sides but KKR need to sort out their bowling going forward in the torunament. Chameera has been brought back into the attack Shashank smacked him for three mammoth sixes to extract 18 runs. Punjab needs 18 more to win to make the highest chased total ever in the history of the tournament. What a game we are having. Bairstow gets to his 100 in just 45 balls what a knock he single handi did the damage in the middle overs and made sure the rate has been under check through and the way things are going this might not even need 20 overs for Punjab to get it done. The Indian Premier League (IPL) season has witnessed several high-scoring chases throughout 17 editions. Rajasthan Royals recorded the highest successful run-chase in IPL history during the 2020 IPL season where they overhauled a 224-run target against the Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) in Sharjah. They equalled the record in the 2024 season, with a sensational chase against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens. RR chased down 224 off the final delivery, led by an unbeaten hundred from Jos Buttler. (Read more) Narine has been brought back into the attack and the matchwinner again delivers the goods for KKR. Shashank has walked into the middle and he has a job to do here. This is a good time for KKR to bowl a few tight overs.  That is another expense over some brutal hitting from Bairstow against Russell. 24 runs came off that last over this is now getting bad to worse for the Kolkata Knight Riders here as well. The way things are going this could be over way before 20 overs.  This is turning into carnage here in Eden Gardens yes the ball is gripping but the brute strength with which the batters are clearing their front leg and hitting the balls into the stands has been remarkable. Off all the days it Bairstow has hit some form when Punjab needed the most.  Vinayakk: Prabhsimran Singh had developed an unfortunate habit. Frequently used as the Impact Player by Punjab Kings, he almost always comes out to bat, goes bang-bang, then gets out in the 20s and 30s. Of the 8 innings before Friday night in Kolkata, Prabhsimran crossed 19 five times but didn't cross 35. At Eden Gardens though, he seemed to put it right in some style. He took Punjab to a blistering start, smashing Harshit Rana, Dushmantha Chameera, Anukul Roy in the powerplay. Then came Sunil Narine, and Prabhsimran welcomed him with a four and six. The 20-ball 54 was a brilliant knock... but it came to an end with a run out at the end of 24-run over. Jonny Bairstow smashed Anukul Roy 4-6-4-4-6 but off the last ball, took off for a single that saw Prabhsimran fall short thanks to a Narine direct hit. As he walked off, he put the bat face close to his helmet grille and roared in frustration. A soft end after a stunning start. Bairstow smacked a six-through long off to bring up his 50 off just 23 balls. That is his first half-century since he came to India in January. His innings are here keeping Punjab Kings in the chase. This is promising to be another close contest. Harshit Rana has been brought back into the attack by Kolkata after a cluster of overs from spin and he bowled a decent over without picking a wicket. Punjab can afford that slowing down of rate because of the hyperaggressive start given by Prabhsimran Singh. After the expensive over from Anukul Roy it has been a good back from Narine just giving away one run in that over after the strategic time out. Here lies the challenge for Punjab batters. They need to deal with Kolkata mystery spinners.  Off the final ball of the powerplay, Prabhsimran got himself runout trying to sneak a quick single. It has also been a dream powerplay for Punjab as they scored their highest in the phase when it was needed the most.  Narine came into the attack and Prabhsimran slog-swept him for a six and brought up his fifty this has been an excellent start from Punjab Kings in this run chase but the challenge is they need to keep the momentum going even after field is spread.  Spin has been introduced by KKR Anukul Roy has been brought into the attack and Prabhsimran played a couple of ugly shots to get boundaries away. However, the wicket seems to be still gripping a bit for spinners.  Prabhsimran has got Punjab to a terrific start here. He is pummeling the bowlers all around the dial. It will be interesting to see if Iyer will turn to spinner as seamers are getting nothing out of this surface at the moment.  Harshit Rana took the new ball from the other end however, missed his mark a couple of times and Prabhsimran punished him with boundaries. They need plenty of these in this powerplay so that they can stay in touch with the target.  Dushmantha Chameera is the new face of KKR and he has taken the new ball and started well. There is not much of a swing on offer however, he did hit the top of the off stump in that first over.  287/3 - SRH vs RCB, Bengaluru, 2024

Punjab needs dew to set in even if they need to have any outside chance in this game as the wicket continues to get slower we will be right back for the 2nd innings action. Sandip G: Amidst Shreyas Iyer’s carnage of Sam Curran—6,4, 6, 6—one stroke stood out for its impossible trajectory. The second six, a flick that was both brutal and beautiful. Iyer had premeditated and moved across, assuming that Curran would spear a wide yorker. But he bowled full on middle and leg stump. So Iyer had to readjust. He did so by keeping his front-leg upright, his back knee bent a touch, careful that it did not slide further away, which could have obstructed the path of the bat. It was an awkward pose, but he kept his poise, and let those malleable wrists twist and close and take the ball to the stands over deep midwicket, all the while standing tall and not bending forward as most batsmen naturally do when flicking, Watch out for the snapping wrists, that imparts direction onto the ball. Iyer loved the shot, as he watched it’s stand-ward ascent. Vinayakk: In an otherwise all-out attacking approach KKR have adopted for this season, Shreyas Iyer has been going slow in the middle order. After starting the season with a 24-ball 39, Shreyas either played short cameos or dropped anchor. There was a 32-ball 34, a 38-ball 38 and a 36-ball 50 thrown into the mix. So it was a little bit of a surprise that he came out to bat in the 16h over when DreRuss got out. The first thought was it would have been the ideal entry point for finisher Rinku Singh. But after struggling with the short balls early on, Shreyas went out all guns blazing this time around. He smashed a 10-ball 28, with intent to go big without taking his time to settle in. Sure, the match situation helped but still, it was a welcome display of aggression from the KKR captain that hasn't been seen too frequently this year. Arshdeep picked up Shreyas Iyer and finished off his spell with a 10-run over. 9 run over. It has been a brilliant spell from the left-armer under the circumstances. Rinku has walked into the middle for the final couple of overs.  Vinayakk: Punjab Kings needed to break the KKR opening partnership early. Phil Salt and Sunil Narine have been key to Kolkata's fast starts eventually ending up in big totals but with their all-out attacking approach, there is also the downside of giving opportunities for the opponents. Punjab actually did well to create these chances. But unfortunately, they came to Eden Gardens with butter fingers. Narine was dropped by Harpreet Brar as early as the third over. Then Salt was put down twice, one an absolute sitter by Sam Curran. The openers went on to add 138 for the first wicket. Then Andre Rusell was given a life too. A smart field placement saw Arshdeep bowl with a fine fly slip but the outside edge that was heading straight into the hands, but gloved away by a diving Jitesh Sharma. Fortunately, this time around, DreRuss was out the next ball as Arshdeep bowled a bouncer. Harshal did take the catch this time. Well, Curran brought himself back into the attack missed his yorkers Iyer stood there and delivered the ball into the stands courtesy of his flexible rubber-like wrists. All the momentum that has been pulled back was regained in that over.  Another decent over in the context of the game from Rabada. After the rampage once the openers fell things have quieted down here. If Punjab can restrict KKR under 250 with the foreign batting options they have at their disposal they might have an outside chance. Arshdeep Singh is brought into the attack and he bounces out Andre Russell. After bowling an expensive first over this has been a good spell from the left-armer. However, still, four overs are remaining and Punjab would be hoping dew to fall in the second innings to help their cause. Sandip G: Sam Curran has developed so many slower-ball variations that he rarely nudged 130kph, let alone 140 which once he regularly clocked. But for once, he was forced to rev up his pace and was indeed rewarded. Phil Salt had clouted him for a pair of flat sixes, both off slower balls. The first one hovered around the 115kph mark, the second even slower at 109 kph. Salt would judge the length and just swing through the line. Curran had already conceded 30 runs in 14 balls and he wanted a shot at redemption. He reverted to his biggest strength, that is to bowl a yorker at full-pelt. The ball only measured 131 clicks on the speedo, but it was pinpoint accurate. The ball drifted in a tad from his wrists, and upon landing, block-hole or thereabouts straightened to blast the off-stump. The batsman was beaten chiefly for pace. Perhaps this is his new trick—reverse the routine. Batsmen are expecting him to take the pace off the ball. So slip one faster, and beat them for pace. It worked. Rahul Chahar has been brought back into the attack after the strategic timeout. He is done for the day and given the way things have unfolded tonight it has been a very good spell from Chahar. With six overs remaining it will be interesting to see how much can KKR get here. Sam Curran has brought himself into the attack and he picks Phil Salt with a brilliant yorker. Both the openers are now back in the hut but there is no respite for Punjab batters as Andre Russell has walked into the middle now.  Finally, Brar has been brought into the attack and he delivered a decent over. The over did not go for a boundary and remained under double digits. Punjab have shot themselves in the foot by not using the left-arm spinner till now as if he has to complete his spell it would go into the death overs of the game. That over is what Punjab needed. Rahul Chahar provides the breakthrough. The wicket is gripping and it is hard to understand why Curran has not even given one over to Brar despite pacers have been taken for cleaners.  10 overs into the game Kolkata are threatening to break SRH's record of highest total here. How will Punjab stop that is impossible to know. They have not taken the opportunities given and their bowling is below par. As we update Narine departs. Salt cuts one through point to get past his 50 of the night. Both openers have made 50. Punjab did take a review against Narina for an LBW which did not go their way. Nothing is working out for Punjab they have been in and out of all the games they have played this is the first time they are looking completely out of their depth.  Another big big over from Rabada and in the due course Narine has gone past fifty as well. This is turning into a nightmare evening for Punjab with batting order which is struggling whatever the score it is from here on it will take a lot for PBKS to get there. Rahul Chahar was brought into the attack and Phil Salt gave another opportunity to backwards point Rabada and he spilt it again. It is the third drop chance of the evening. The partnership is already flying for KKR and these drops are helping their cause as well. Arshdeep bowled a decent final over off the powerplay however, the disappointing part of that over was been Salt gave a catch which Curran standing at mid-off dropped.  This is getting bad to ugly for PBKS 30 minutes into the game already. This is a blistering start for KKR yet again. Punjab who has been playing low-scoring games at Mullanpur for the last five games need to adapt to the conditions quickly here. More importantly, they need to get a breakthrough as the batters just keep coming in this KKR line up one after the other.  Rabada was given the ball however, Sunil Narine was in no mood to show any respect to Punjab's ace bowler and he climbed onto him. Four overs into the game KKR have reached 59. It will be interesting to see how Punjab reacts from here on. Surprising tactic from Curran to throw the ball in the powerplay to Harshal Patel who got a bit of pasting from Phil Salt. This is another rollicking start for KKR. PBKS need to quickly get in a bowler who can pick a wicket aka Kagiso Rabada Arshdeep Singh has taken the new ball from the other end and it has been an expensive over from the left-armer. Must say his form in the tournament continues to spiral down as each game is passing by. Narine on the other hand has got himself a start. We are done with the first over Sam Curran has taken the new ball and instead of looking to swing the ball up front he used a few slower ones to get the better of Sunil Narine who was up to the task as he smacked the bowler over covers for a boundary.  The pitch is looking good for batting the last couple of games we had at this venue have been on the higher-scoring side and the atmosphere here is promising to be the same today. The openers are walking out into the middle and the ground is buzzing as it always does. Total matches played: 32,  Kolkata Knight Riders won: 21,  Punjab Kings won: 11 Coming back (into the IPL), obviously to a different team. Getting to know about the youngsters in this KKR set-up, I have played against a few, but I've seen a lot of talent in this franchise, sharing my thoughts and answering their questions, it's been enjoyable. We know that the grounds in India are smaller when compared to back at home (in Australia), the wickets are generally pretty good throughout the game, the impact player rule as well. The batters are coming in with an intention to throw their bats around. You can see that impact in the Sunrisers with Heady at the top, just going out and trying to clear the infield. It's been a challenge to come here and play in the best T20 league in the world. The wickets have played differently in the day games and the night games - it does become easier to bat under the lights, it has been a learning curve. Playing in the heat is a part of the game, fortunately it's only 20 overs in the field and you can deal with it. Things have been going well so far (for KKR), different individuals have stood up, the next two home games are very important for us before we travel. So the two points today could be very important in that regard. Punjab Kings Impact Subs: Prabhsimran Singh, Rishi Dhawan, Vidhwath Kaverappa, Shivam Singh, Prince Choudhary Kolkata Knight Riders Subs: Suyash Sharma, Anukul Roy, Manish Pandey, Vaibhav Arora, Rahmanullah Gurbaz Philip Salt(w), Sunil Narine, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Shreyas Iyer(c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Dushmantha Chameera, Varun Chakaravarthy, Harshit Rana Jonny Bairstow, Sam Curran(c), Rilee Rossouw, Jitesh Sharma(w), Shashank Singh, Ashutosh Sharma, Harpreet Brar, Harshal Patel, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh We've had different players stepping up at different times, that's the thing I'm pleased about this season. Starcy got a cut on his finger in the last game, Dushmantha Chameera replaces him. Need a great start and then convert it into a big score, hoping to continue the same form and momentum. We will have a bowl. We had 4 games at home, unfortunately lost all four, guys are ready for the away games though. We know what we need to do from here, just go out and play. Liam Livingstone misses out, Jonny Bairstow is back. In Punjab Kings, they meet a side that has been inconsistent and despite two good finds in Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma, they haven’t exactly done well during key moments and like every other year, they are all but out of play-off contention. The experience has been very good, I'm enjoying right now and hopefully it'll stay the same during the rest of the season. Our only thought is to to have the right process (on his batting partnership with Shashank Singh), if we do that we'll definitely start winning. Not thinking about it., my job is only about batting and batting well for the team. I can't talk about the top-order failures, but I can assure that we'll do well tonight. It's absolutely scorching at mid-forty degrees which will make it slightly uncomfortable for the players. 66m and 63m square boundaries while the straight boundary is at 73m. This is going to play as it has right through the season, it has plenty of pace and bounce on offer, the pitch itself is rock hard, the silt content on this surface is around 70% or more, in general it's around 50-60%. There are a lot of patches on a good length area on both ends, the grass is abrasive and the spinners could get some help, especially in the first innings. KKR's spinners should have an advantage as they rely on pace and lateral movement. It's a high scoring venue, there's now dew, the curators have confirmed the same. The captain winning the tos could still opt to chase first In the heyday of fearsome Caribbean pace packs, Andy Roberts, the patron saint of fast bowlers, was asked if he would ever resort to a slower ball. He replied, in a condescending tone, the story goes: “The quicker one is the bouncer that hit him on the helmet because he played it too late; the slower one is the bouncer that struck him on the helmet because he played too early.” None of his compatriots or the fast bowling fraternity elsewhere, like Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thompson, felt the need to reduce pace to deceive batsmen. Times have changed. The slower ball is as powerful a weapon, across formats, as the toe-crusher or rib-tickler. Even more so in T20s, where not possessing a lethal slower ball is akin to a doctor without a super-specialization degree these days. Even the quickest and deadliest have it. Jasprit Bumrah and Pat Cummins; Shaheen Shah Afridi and Kagiso Rabada. Those that haven’t fine-tuned one find themselves swept aside in this format, even if they own several other gifts. As is the plight of Mitchell Starc, the most expensive fetch in IPL. Total matches played: 12,  Kolkata Knight Riders won: 9,  Punjab Kings won: 3 ""We need to stick to our routines and processes and see to it that we execute the things we want."" - Shreyas Iyer wants KKR to keep doing the basics right ""Now we know what to do, we have to win every game."" - Sam Curran knows his team's task ahead is simple yet complicated  Is the absence of the slower ball robbing Mitchell Starc off another dimension and making him predictable? A lack of a well-crafted slower-ball has compounded Starc's struggles, rendering him one-dimensional, neutering his death-over prowess. (BCCI) Mitchell Starc is an irresistible concoction of gifts–the in-swinging yorker, the head-winking bouncer, the untameable hard length balls, pace and control, strength and stamina; in short everything a fast bowler would crave for, enough to coax ₹24.75 crore from KKR’s pockets–except that he doesn’t possess a high-definition slower ball.

200,Technology,When could TikTok be banned under new US law?,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53476117,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14047/production/_133219918_tiktok-gettyimages-2074368670.jpg.webp,"APRIL 26, 2024",The video app TikTok could be banned in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance.,"TikTok could be banned in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance. The video sharing app has millions of users worldwide, but has faced questions over the security of users' data and its links to the government in Beijing. Lawmakers from both major US political parties have called for a law that bans TikTok unless ByteDance agrees to sell the app to a non-Chinese company. They fear the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users. TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government. The House of Representatives and Senate have now both approved a $95bn (£76bn) foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan which also contained a bill paving the way for the forced sale of TikTok. The legislation has been signed into law by President Joe Biden. Previous attempts to block the app in the US on national security grounds have failed. Former US President Donald Trump tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020. But Mr Trump - the Republican 2024 presidential candidate - has criticised the new legislation, arguing that limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook. Although Mr Biden has signed the bill into law, it does not mean an immediate US ban for TikTok. The legislation gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to a new buyer, with an additional three-month grace period, before any ban would take effect. That means that the sale deadline would most likely come some time in 2025, after the winner of the 2024 presidential election takes office. If Mr Trump wins, he may seek to block the ban from being implemented. TikTok has vowed to fight the forced sale in the courts, which could take years. The most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices. App stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. It would also mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs. The bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US. It gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. TikTok has called the legislation an ""unconstitutional ban"" and affront to the US right to free speech. ""We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,"" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. ""Rest assured,"" he told users in a video, ""we aren't going anywhere"". He previously said the bill would give its social media rivals more power and put thousands of American jobs at risk. ByteDance would also have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move. Many US creators and users have criticised the potential ban. Tiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work. In March 2024, TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill. But the deluge of ""confused"" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired. Several politicians said the campaign worsened the concerns they had about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation. It is thought the US TikTok bill could inspire similar moves elsewhere. TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia. The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears. At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm, a set of instructions which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material. Users are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You. The Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app. This curated feed has become the main destination for users looking for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral. Critics say the app collects more data than other social media platforms in order to power its highly personalised system. This can include information about users' location, device, the content they engage with and keystroke rhythms they exhibit while typing. But popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar data from users. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

They went down more than 15% in after-hours trading in New York despite the tech giant revealing strong earnings figures. Boss Mark Zuckerberg said it would take some time before its huge AI investment increased revenues. Meta also said its X rival, Threads, now has more than 150 million monthly active users, increasing the pressure on the Elon Musk-owned platform. ""Threads is well on its way to beating X by becoming the Twitter alternative users and advertisers are longing for,"" said Mike Proulx, from analysts Forrester. He also said Meta stood to gain from TikTok's possible sale or ban in the US - a development the app has vowed to fight. Meta has been updating its ad-buying products with AI tools to boost earnings growth. It has also been introducing more AI features on its social media platforms such as chat assistants. The firm said it now expected to spend between $35bn and $40bn, (£28bn-32bn) in 2024, up from an earlier prediction of $30-$37bn. For investors, that outweighed the positive news on earnings. First quarter revenue rose 27% to $36.46bn, while analysts had expected earnings of $36.16bn. Analysts though said there was a logic to Meta's approach. Sophie Lund-Yates, from Hargreaves Lansdown, said Meta's ""substantial investment"" in AI has helped it get people to spend time on its platforms, so advertisers were willing to spend more money ""in a time when digital advertising uncertainty remains rife"". More than 50 countries are due to have elections this year, she said, ""which hugely increases uncertainty"" and can spook advertisers. Ms Lund-Yates said that ""looking further ahead, the biggest risk [for Meta] remains regulatory"". Last year, Meta was fined €1.2bn (£1bn) by Ireland's data authorities for mishandling people's data when transferring it between Europe and the US. And in February of this year, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg faced blistering criticism from US lawmakers and was pushed to apologise to families of victims of child sexual exploitation. Ms Lund-Yates added that the firm has ""more than enough resources to throw at legal challenges, but that doesn’t rule out the risks of ups and downs in market sentiment"". Copyright 2024 BBC.

It caps a difficult period for the electric vehicle (EV) maker, which - faced with falling sales - has announced thousands of job cuts. Boss Elon Musk remains bullish about its prospects, telling investors the launch of new models would be brought forward. Its share price has risen but analysts say it continues to face significant challenges, including from lower-cost rivals. The company has suffered from falling demand and competition from cheaper Chinese imports which has led its stock price to collapse by 43% over 2024. Figures for the first quarter of 2024 revealed revenues of $21.3bn, down on analysts' predictions of just over $22bn. But the decision by Tesla to bring forward the launch of new models from the second half of 2025 boosted its shares by nearly 12.5% in after-hours trading. It did not reveal pricing details for the new vehicles. However Mr Musk made clear he also grander ambitions, touting Tesla's AI credentials and plans for self-driving vehicles - even going as far as to say considering it to be just a car company was the ""wrong framework."" ""If somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy I think they should not be an investor,"" he said. Such sentiments have been questioned by analysts though, with Deutsche Bank saying driverless cars face ""technological, regulatory and operational challenges."" Some investors have called for the company to instead focus on releasing a lower price, mass-market EV. However, Tesla has already been on a charm offensive, trying to win over new customers by dropping its prices in a series of markets in the face of falling sales. It also said its situation was not unique. ""Global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs,"" it said. Despite plans to bring forward new models originally planned for next year the firm is cutting its workforce. Tesla said it would lose 3,332 jobs in California and 2,688 positions in Texas, starting mid-June. The cuts in Texas represent 12% of Tesla's total workforce of almost 23,000 in the area where its gigafactory and headquarters are located. However, Mr Musk sought to downplay the move. ""Tesla has now created over 30,000 manufacturing jobs in California!"" he said in a post on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday. Another 285 jobs will be lost in New York. Tesla's total workforce stood at more than 140,000 late last year, up from around 100,000 at the end of 2021, according to the company's filings with US regulators.  The car firm is also facing other issues, with a struggle over Mr Musk's compensation still raging on. On Wednesday, Tesla asked shareholders to vote for a proposal to accept Mr Musk's compensation package - once valued at $56bn - which had been rejected by a Delaware judge. The judge found Tesla's directors had breached their fiduciary duty to the firm by awarding Mr Musk the pay-out. Due to the fall in Tesla's stock value, the compensation package is now estimated to be around $10bn less - but still greater than the GDP of many countries. In addition, Tesla wants its shareholders to agree to the firm being moved from Delaware to Texas - which Mr Musk called for after the judge rejected his payday. Copyright 2024 BBC.

The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said it had discovered more than two thousand remotely filmed child abuse images of three to six-year-olds online in 2023. If follows recent warnings from the communications watchdog Ofcom that almost a quarter of children aged five to seven have a smartphone of their own. Responding to the report Security Minister Tom Tugendhat urged tech firms to do more to prevent abuse. He also called on parents ""to speak to your children about their use of social media, because the platforms you presume safe may pose a risk”. The IWF is a charity which helps detect and remove child sexual abuse imagery online. New analysis published in its latest annual report revealed it had discovered 2401 images of children aged three to six in so-called “self-generated” images on the open internet in 2023. “Self-generated” images are where a child is persuaded, coerced or tricked by a predator into carrying out acts via a webcam or handheld device. Nearly one in seven images were category A - the rating it assigns to those featuring the most serious abuse. Six in 10 images showed “sexual posing with nudity” it suggested. Analysts who reviewed some of the images found many, “were are taken at home in children’s bedrooms or in family bathrooms when the child is alone or with another child such as a sibling or friend”. Sometimes children were “completely unaware” they were being recorded. IWF analysts were confident that someone else was directing what happened as three to six-year-old children “are sexually naive and would not normally be aware of the possibility of this type of sexual behaviour,” it said. The report also notes that online child abuse material is more “extreme” with the charity reporting a 22% increase in category A imagery. Ofcom's research suggested a third of parents whose five to seven-year-olds browse social media are allowed to do so alone. Ian Critchley, who leads on child protection for the National Police Chiefs' Council, said protecting young children was not just the responsibility of parents and carers. ""The biggest change"" needed to come from the tech companies and online platforms, he said. As part of its work implementing the new Online Safety Act the communications watchdog has said it will consult on how automated tools, including AI, can be used to ""proactively detect"" illegal content - including child sexual abuse material. But the IWF is calling for swift action and argues technology firms should not wait. ""The harms are happening to children now, and our response must be immediate,"" its chief executive Susie Hargreaves said. AI is already used by some big tech firms to help identify content that violates its terms, including child abuse material. This is principally used to help identify material that is then reviewed by human moderators. But experts warn AI alone is not a panacea. Professor Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey told the BBC: ""AI may prove useful in helping with the scale of the data being analysed but at its current state of development it shouldn’t be considered a complete solution.""

Commissioner Thierry Breton said the feature is ""toxic and addictive"", particularly when used by children. TikTok has until Wednesday to defend the rewards programme, or it could be suspended as early as Thursday 25 April. TikTok told the BBC it was disappointed with the decision. ""We stand ready to trigger... interim measures including the suspension of the TikTok Lite reward programme,"" said European Commissioner Thierry Breton in a post on X, formerly Twitter. In addition, the Commission has opened formal proceedings against the social media company to assess whether it has broken EU law. Under EU law which came into force last year, large platforms like TikTok have to produce a risk assessment before they make large changes to their products. The Commission asked for TikTok's risk assessment into the Task & Rewards programme last week, but says the social media company failed to submit it in time. It has said that the system risks ""serious damage for the mental health of users"". TikTok launched its ""Task and Rewards"" programme last week in France and Spain. It is a new feature on TikTok Lite, a slimmed-down version of the main social media app, which uses less data and space on users' phones. Under the programme, users can earn the equivalent of a few pence per day for watching videos and engaging on the app. The Commission is investigating whether this could have negative effects on the mental health of users, including children, ""especially as a result of the new feature stimulating addictive behaviour"". TikTok says rewards are only open to people over the age of 18, and tools are in place to verify their ages. But the Commission suspects a ""lack of effective age verification mechanisms"". TikTok has no plans to roll the feature out beyond France and Spain as it stands. It is also available in some countries in southeast Asia. This is the second formal investigation into TikTok launched in the EU. In February, the Commission opened formal proceedings against the social media company, investigating whether it broke rules around data protection, protection for children and policing harmful content. At the time, TikTok said it would cooperate with the investigation and continued to work with experts in online safety. Under the EU's Digital Services Act, companies can be fined up to 6% of global revenue. In a statement issued to the BBC, a TikTok spokesperson said: ""We are disappointed with this decision - the TikTok Lite rewards hub is not available to under 18s, and there is a daily limit on video watch tasks.

According to the claim, lodged at the High Court in London, ""covert tracking technology"" was deployed, and highly sensitive information was illegally shared with advertisers. Law firm Austen Hays says there are more than 650 claimants and ""thousands"" of UK users were affected. Grindr says it will ""respond vigorously"" to the claim. A Grindr spokesperson said the company takes privacy ""extremely seriously"", and added the claim ""appears to be based on a mischaracterization of practices from more than four years ago"". Austen Hays says, if the case is successful, claimants could receive thousands of pounds in damages. The claim form submitted to the High Court says the law firm hopes to claim more than £100,000 in total. Chaya Hanoomanjee from Austen Hays, who is the lawyer leading the claim, said the claimants ""experienced significant distress over their highly sensitive and private information being shared without their consent"". “Grindr owes it to the LGBTQ+ community it serves to compensate those whose data has been compromised,"" she said. The dating app is used by 13 million people every month, and an Ofcom report from May 2023 found that it was used by roughly 924,000 people in the UK. It also had the highest engagement of all dating apps, with people using it for an average time of six hours and 49 minutes that month. According to the claim, the company shared sensitive data with third parties for commercial purposes, in breach of the UK's data privacy laws. It says it included information about the ethnicity and sexual orientation of users. The claim alleges it mainly occurred before 3 April 2018, though the data was also shared between 25 May 2018 and 7 April 2020. It names data analytics companies Apptimize and Localytics as third parties which had access to the sensitive data. However, it says that a potentially unlimited number of third parties used the data to customise advertisements to Grindr's users. In addition, it is claimed that firms may then have retained some of the shared data for their own purposes. It emerged in 2018 that Grindr had been sharing personal data, including HIV status of users, with Apptimize and Localytics. Those companies were paid to monitor how people used the app in order to improve it. At the time, Grindr defended the practice, saying it was in line with industry standards – but it said it then stopped sharing HIV data with those companies. The firm said it had never sold the data to any advertisers. In 2021, the company was fined £5.5m by Norwegian authorities for breaking GDPR (EU general data protection regulation) rules. It was found to have shared user data, without seeking explicit consent, to third-party companies for the purpose of advertising. In 2022, Grindr was reprimanded by the UK's data watchdog over its data protection practices. The Information Commissioner's Office ruled that the company had failed to ""provide effective and transparent privacy information to its UK data subjects in relation to the processing of their personal data"".

In March and April 2024, all have seen customers struggle to access some of their services - from baked goods, to Big Macs and WhatsApp messages – because of IT outages. Coincidence? Not according to experts, who say such outages now really are happening more frequently. These recent high-profile cases have thrust one particular website into the spotlight. Downdetector is a platform which monitors web outages - its data gives an idea of the extent of the problems companies have been facing recently. More than 1.75 million user-reported issues were flagged worldwide for WhatsApp on 3 April, according to the site. It says tens of thousands were also reported for the App Store and Apple TV. Neither firm responded to the BBC's questions about what had caused their outages. But Brennen Smith, vice-president of technology at Downdetector's parent company Ookla, says such instances reflect what they are seeing - which is more outages taking place and a higher number of reports from users as they happen. ""The internet is not exactly getting more stable,"" he told the BBC. To understand why, you need to understand a little more about the internet itself. Like software, it is composed of many layers. And every time regulators demand changes to platforms, consumers seek seamless access to data or investors push for buzzy new features like AI chatbots, new layers are added. Introducing more layers and complexity creates more risk of things going wrong. ""Right now there's a push for these mega giants to incorporate very game-changing new technology into their products and services,"" Mr Smith said. ""I think with the push for innovation now, we're going to start to see tech companies move faster [but] it comes at the risk of potentially breaking things."" The other thing to bear in mind with the internet: there are lots of different things that can make it fall over. Typos in code, faulty hardware, power failures and cyber attacks are just a few examples of why a service might go down. Even severe weather, such as heatwaves, storms and natural disasters can affect data centres - the huge halls housing powerful computers, known as servers, upon which online services rely. ""There are a lot of moving parts, and if just one of those goes wrong you can see problems,"" says Sam Kirkman of cyber-security firm NetSPI. Another issue is lots of firms have moved from managing their servers and infrastructure in-house to putting them on the cloud over the last decade. That has enabled those firms to do more ""faster than they ever could before"", Mr Kirkman told the BBC - but it also means a single outage in one place at the cloud service provider can ""cascade across a lot of the platforms, technologies and companies we use today"". Glitches for some of the biggest names in the industry - namely Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud - have previously led to downtime for thousands of customers. Even those impacting smaller, yet heavily relied-upon providers like Fastly and Cloudflare have also had a knock-on effect for services. The UK government's portal gov.uk was among major platforms knocked offline when Fastly had issues in June 2021. Sudden spikes in demand for a service can cause prolonged or complex outages, especially on high-traffic events like Black Friday or during low-staffed periods like bank holidays or weekends. Theories that Fridays see more outages than other days of the week may just be speculation, Mr Smith says. But he notes many firms do have policies not to ship updates or changes on them. ""Less humans have hands on keyboards, less eyes on monitoring systems. It's a time where you don't want to be rolling out changes,"" he says. IT glitches affecting Nationwide, McDonald's and Sainsbury's all took place on or began on Fridays in March, though they have been attributed to different causes. More widely, engineers trying to patch problems and get a service back online during outages can also find themselves contending with a stampede of users trying to get hold of it. Cloudflare said it encountered one of these so-called ""thundering herds"" when, during an outage stemming from a data centre power failure in November 2023, a slew of requests initially overwhelmed a recovery site. Underpinning all of this is another fundamental truth of the online world: while the services and products on offer grow ever more sophisticated, its basic architecture is, often, quite antiquated. In other words, the modern internet relies ""on a fabric of really old technology"", says Mr Kirkman. He highlights Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - one of the internet's most important in determining where traffic goes - as a good example, shown by Meta's six-hour outage in October 2021. Misconfigured BGP updates by Facebook meant it essentially stopped talking to the rest of the internet. And users of its platforms were likewise left unable to communicate with families or manage their businesses. Mr Kirkman says BGP represents an ongoing challenge because it has to be maintained, but cannot be easily updated and minor configurations can take down entire platforms. It highlights what he says some might consider ""technical debt"" as an issue potentially affecting the whole of the internet. These problems are not new. But our growing reliance upon online services means they are becoming an ever bigger challenge for firms seeking to prevent them. ""What really we're seeing is that people are caring more and more,"" says Mr Smith. ""I'd say now more than ever, it's really important that services are able to stay resilient to stay online and still bring new innovations and features to market,"" he adds. Copyright 2024 BBC.

"," In March and April 2024, all have seen customers struggle to access some of their services - from baked goods, to Big Macs and WhatsApp messages – because of IT outages. But Brennen Smith, vice-president of technology at Downdetector's parent company Ookla, says such instances reflect what they are seeing - which is more outages taking place and a higher number of reports from users as they happen. And every time regulators demand changes to platforms, consumers seek seamless access to data or investors push for buzzy new features like AI chatbots, new layers are added. ""Right now there's a push for these mega giants to incorporate very game-changing new technology into their products and services,"" Mr Smith said."
207,Technology,Almost a quarter of kids aged 5-7 have smartphones,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68838029,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/12056/production/_123941837_gettyimages-1333622871.jpg.webp,"APRIL 19, 2024","The regulator calls the data a ""wake up call"", and says parents and industry need to do more.","Nearly a quarter of UK five-to-seven-year-olds now have their own smartphone, Ofcom research suggests. Social media use also rose in the age group over last year with nearly two in five using messaging service WhatsApp, despite its minimum age of 13. The communications regulator warned parental enforcement of rules ""appeared to be diminishing."" It also said the figures should be a ""wake up call"" for the industry to do more to protect children. In its annual study of children's relationship with the media and online worlds, Ofcom said the percentage of children aged between five and seven who used messaging services had risen from 59% to 65%. The number on social media went up from 30% to 38%, while for livestreams it increased from 39% to 50%. Just over 40% are reported to be gaming online - up from 34% the year before. Over half of children under 13 used social media, contrary to most of the big platforms' rules, and many admitted to lying to gain access to new apps and services. ""I think this is a wake up call for industry. They have to take account of the users they have, not the users that their terms and conditions say they have,"" Mark Bunting, from Ofcom's Online Safety Group told BBC News. ""We've known for a long time that children, under the age limit on a lot of the most popular apps, are widely using those apps, and companies are now under a legal obligation to take steps to keep those children safe,"" he added. Some campaigners want age limits to be introduced for smartphone use, and existing ones raised for social media. However it is already the case that most phones possessed by children are likely to have been provided by parents - under-18's cannot sign contracts, and most big operators say they do not sell pay-as-you-go phones to under-16's. Many parents give children phones because they want to be able to contact them or to track them via their mobile. How can you keep children safe online? Parents who spoke to the BBC also cited peer pressure, saying it was a struggle to keep children off social media when all their friends were a using an app. One parent said she felt ""pushed into a corner"". Heather Bryson who is 11 won wide recognition for her online exercise videos designed to help people in care homes during the pandemic, particularly those suffering dementia. She's had a smartphone since she was eight-years-old. Her parents feel she's benefited socially from being online, but what she does and who she communicates with are closely supervised. ""I think it's become an important tool for anyone growing up these days"", her father, Gary Bryson says. ""Being able to monitor exactly what she's doing is paramount"". Heather says it lets her talk with friends on social media and through message apps, but there are negatives. ""Sometimes I get boys swearing at me online in chats which is not nice, but the good things there are loads of nice people out there too"". ""It's just something that you get used to after a while but you shouldn't have to"", she says. Only a third of parents know the correct minimum age requirement for most social media platforms Ofcom suggests But the regulator said parents were also less willing to enforce the rules they knew about. Three in ten parents were willing to let a child aged 5-7 have a social media profile even if it was under the minimum age permitted for the apps, an increase compared to last year. Parents may be ""resigned"" to not being able to control children's online lives the new report notes. Mr Bunting said he had ""a lot of sympathy"" for parents on this issue: ""It may not be about preventing use entirely for children under 13, which I think is very difficult in today's society. But parents can talk to their children about using those services safely. And we'd encourage them to do that,"" he said. Some say investigations like that carried out by the BBC this month - which found that children as young as nine were added to a malicious WhatsApp group - mean further action is needed. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has previously suggested that he favours requiring app-stores to check the ages of users. Responding to the Ofcom report, Clare Fernyhough, of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, told the BBC that society had sleep-walked into ""just assuming that we all need a smartphone - and now we're beginning to see the huge impact that that's having"" But Professor Sonia Livingstone, Director of the Digital Futures for Children centre, said it was wrong to protect children by restricting their access to technology. ""This is the first generation with access to a powerful personal computer, it could be so amazing for them, and that's what children want too,"" she told the BBC. ""But the companies are risky by design, and what we need is child rights by design"", she said. Ofcom said new age limits for smartphones would be a matter for government. In May it will be consulting on the steps it expects tech firms to take to ensure children have safer experiences online, and later on new uses of AI to combat harmful content online. In a statement, the Secretary of State for Science, Technology and Innovation Michelle Donelan said protecting children online was the government's number one priority. ""Children as young as five should not be accessing social media and these stark findings show why our Online Safety Act is essential,"" she said. Does your young child have a smartphone?

The issue had sparked controversy, with critics noting the names of other cities do not prompt flag emojis to appear. Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the ancient city. Apple previously told the BBC the flag's appearance when Jerusalem was typed had been inadvertent. The issue, according to Apple, related to unintended behaviour in a feature called predictive emoji. iPhones can suggest emojis when words are typed in messages, and other apps. Users noticed the flag started being suggested after the company rolled out iOS 17.4.1 - the latest publicly available version of the software on which its mobile devices run. Critics such as TV presenter Rachel Riley had demanded Apple explain why the flag appeared, particularly when other cities do not produce flag emojis when typed. ""Showing double standards with respect to Israel is a form of antisemitism,"" she wrote on social media. Apple's apparent resolution is currently only in the ""developer beta"" version of iOS 17.5 released on Tuesday. The Apple Developer Programme allows programmers building apps to sign up for early releases of the software - called beta versions - so they can test out apps they are building on them. In the new update no emoji is suggested when a user types ""Jerusalem"", in line with what happens with other cities. It's not clear when the update will be released more widely, either as a public beta, or as an finished update to the general public. The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest disputes in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel sees the whole of Jerusalem as its eternal, undivided capital, while Palestinians claim the eastern part as the capital of their hoped-for future state. East Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in a war in 1967. They have since been viewed internationally as occupied Palestinian territory. There have been increased tensions in the Middle East since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. The subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed 33,729 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

With its unique culture, cuisine and stunning natural beauty, it's no wonder why Japan is a popular destination for travelers from around the world. From ancient temples to modern cities, there is something for everyone — making it the perfect place for a memorable vacation. However, Japan can also be incredibly expensive, thanks to the high cost of food, lodging and airfare. The solution? Points and miles.  Traveling to Japan using points and miles is a great way to experience this fascinating country's culture, cuisine and natural beauty without breaking the bank. With an abundance of airline rewards programs offering flights from North America for as little as 40,000 miles round-trip, making your dream trip a reality with some strategic planning. From taking advantage of airline loyalty programs or signing up for credit cards with generous rewards points, there are plenty of ways for travelers looking for a budget-friendly journey through Japan. Here’s everything you need to know about traveling to Japan using points and miles: How to use points and miles to save money on travel Flying to Japan using airline miles is fairly attainable, with many airlines servicing Osaka and two airports in Tokyo (Haneda and Narita). Award rates are also reasonable for international travel, especially on business and first class. Here’s a look at the cheapest award flights to Japan, broken down by airline, along with ways you can earn the required miles through credit card welcome bonuses: The best credit cards with no international fees All Nippon Airways is a Japan-based Star Alliance carrier with many direct flight options. ANA Mileage Club offers some of the lowest mileage rates to Japan, starting at just 40,000 round-trip in economy class. ANA utilizes a seasonal award chart, with prices varying during low, regular and high season. ANA miles are easy to earn, thanks to a 1:1 transfer partnership with American Express Membership Rewards. With the current welcome bonuses offered by American Express, you can book up to two round-trip tickets to Japan on points alone.

Other Alaska partners that fly to Japan include American Airlines and Korean Air. First-class tickets are cheap relative to most other loyalty programs, at just 140,000 miles round-trip. Best of all, Alaska Airlines offers a free stopover on international itineraries. So you can add another city in Japan (or another country) to your trip without redeeming more miles. Unfortunately, Alaska miles are a little harder to come by since Alaska Mileage Plan doesn’t partner with any major transfer programs. Instead, you can use two co-branded credit cards to earn enough miles for a trip to Japan. Granted, you won’t earn enough for a first-class ticket, but you could generate enough for economy or business class.

You can accrue enough miles for at least one round-trip ticket with 1-2 credit card welcome bonuses. American is also a 1:1 transfer partner of Bilt Rewards, though the Bilt Mastercard doesn’t currently offer a sign-up bonus.

Plan your visit with this guide.,"If you’re not from Oregon and the Willamette Valley rings a bell, chances are you may know a bit about wine. Stretching from just south of Portland clear down to just south of Eugene, this region has been known as a hub for wine tourism for decades. While plenty of people travel to the Willamette Valley specifically to go wine tasting, this lush region offers so much more, from easy-to-reach hiking trails to quirky attractions sure to keep kids and grown-ups amused in equal measure. To help you plan your time and budget your trip, here's our guide to everything you need to know about the Willamette Valley. The Willamette Valley really shines during the summer months, when long, hot days give way to light-sweater weather at night. This is the time of year when festivals abound and sun-starved Oregonians come out in droves, eager to take advantage of the gorgeous – but fleeting – good weather of July and August. If you’re coming for wine tasting, summer is a particularly fantastic time to be in the area, when grapes are on the vine and Willamette Valley wineries open up their view-blessed terraces. However, Willamette Valley truly is a year-round destination. Fall is a beautiful time to visit, when area orchards and wineries are busy with the harvest. The Thanksgiving weekend is bustling in the northern part of the valley, when area wineries coordinate special events and releases. Winter slows things down a bit, with many wineries closing for the season, but you won’t have to compete much to secure a hotel reservation. Snowfall is rare, and when it does come down it’s typically only for a couple of days in the height of winter. The spring brings with it a mix of rain and sunshine, which results in vibrant rainbows and colorful blooms. Want to explore more of Oregon? Here's our seasonal guide Many people visit the region on a day trip from Portland, and it’s easy enough to hit up a few wineries and spend time taking in pastoral views along the way in just one day. Just make sure you go with a guide or have a designated driver. However, with two or three days in the Willamette Valley, you’ll be able to do some hiking or wine tasting and take in a few area attractions, without feeling rushed. The region is somewhat spread out, so it’s often easiest to just concentrate on one area at a time.               "," While plenty of people travel to the Willamette Valley specifically to go wine tasting, this lush region offers so much more, from easy-to-reach hiking trails to quirky attractions sure to keep kids and grown-ups amused in equal measure. If you’re coming for wine tasting, summer is a particularly fantastic time to be in the area, when grapes are on the vine and Willamette Valley wineries open up their view-blessed terraces. Here's our seasonal guide Many people visit the region on a day trip from Portland, and it’s easy enough to hit up a few wineries and spend time taking in pastoral views along the way in just one day. However, with two or three days in the Willamette Valley, you’ll be able to do some hiking or wine tasting and take in a few area attractions, without feeling rushed."

Straddling the South Saskatchewan River, it has been the province’s cultural and economic hub since its settlement in the late 19th century (but not its capital – that falls to Regina). The Northern Plains Indigenous Peoples had been guardians of this land for over 6000 years when, in 1883, white Methodists founded the town as a temperance colony, naming it after the purple berry growing in the region. While the railroad eventually reached the fledgling town in 1890, Saskatoon still only had 113 inhabitants at the turn of the century. A boom period of new settlers and entrepreneurs soon followed, and Saskatoon grew into a thriving city, albeit isolated from big cities like Vancouver, Toronto and Montréal. Today, the sometimes stark prairie landscapes around the city look like nowhere else in the country. Downtown, you’ll find street art tours, compelling museums, craft beer breweries, a variety of architecture and some fine riverside trails. And Saskatoon now proudly explains and celebrates the Indigenous Peoples who have been here for thousands of years, with the Wanuskewen complex a majestic and poignant monument to that past and present. These top tips can help you plan a trip to Saskatoon. Though Saskatoon – one of the sunniest cities in Canada – receives plenty of sunlight (2350.4 hours annually), winters are long and cold so plan to visit during the glorious summer months between June and August. This is the busiest time of year, but since Saskatoon is a little more under-the-radar than other Canadian cities, it’s not overwhelmed by tourists and offers much better value for money regarding accommodation and eating out.  The city comes alive with music on those effulgent summer days with magnificent festivals across multiple genres including the Saskatchewan Jazz Festival, Rock the River and the Ness Creek Music Festival. And for those who do want to embrace Saskatchewan winter scenes, the Nutrien Wintershines Festival hosts ice sculptures, cook-offs, stargazing and more.  Allow two to three days to explore Saskatoon, but also leave time for attractions on the city’s outskirts that make use of the abundant prairie space. You’ll spend the majority of your time in downtown Saskatoon, on the river trails and the Broadway neighborhood, which is ideal for a weekend. More planning is needed for the excursions out of the city, so map out an extra day or two for those depending on time and budget.

That's why we've gathered nine destinations that will make a big gathering an unforgettable experience.,"Organizing a group trip can be a daunting task. Deciding where to go, what to do and where you'll stay with a group of people — who all have their own opinions — can be challenging enough to nearly convince you not to go. But certain destinations are decidedly worth the hassle. Whether you are traveling with friends or with family, here are nine places that are perfect for your next group adventure.  The Berkshires in Massachusetts is a popular escape for many East Coast city dwellers due to the region's fall foliage and charming towns. Basing yourself in Great Barrington offers a wholesome oasis for any type of big group. Rent a house, preferably on a lake, and sit back and enjoy the long weekend. Great Barrington's quaint main street is worth an afternoon excursion. Flip through vinyl at Rob's Records, find your next favorite side table at The Berkshire Galleries of Great Barrington and round the day off with dinner at Prarie Whale.  For literature fans, The Berkshires were once home to many writers, including Edith Wharton. Take a day trip to visit her estate, The Mount, for history, culture and stunning architecture. And when all that relaxing starts to feel dull, break a sweat with a hike to the largest waterfall in Massachusetts, Bash Bish Falls. Is your group looking for an unforgettable adventure? Tanzania offers a wealth of group-centered activities, primarily in the bush. If it's always been your dream to catch a glimpse of the Big Five (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino), pack your friends or family into a Land Rover and head to the Serengeti. Spend your days cruising through the Ngorongoro Crater, enjoying cocktails under the stars, and getting a front-row seat to some of Earth's most fascinating creatures.

Here are our tips.","Often packed with as many visitors as there are roadside hawkers, Chiang Mai is one of Thailand’s most-loved destinations, offering a cool respite from the beaches and busy cities further south. While there’s a lot to do in town, the best experiences in Chiang Mai are often found in the province’s natural surroundings. And as with the rest of Thailand, the weather remains warm and pleasant year-round, rain and smoke can make or break even the best-planned vacation up north.  Scaling rugged mountains, braving the thrill of white water rapids, enjoying nature’s larder or forging connections with the local wildlife – these are the experiences that define Chiang Mai, whatever the weather. However, there's one specific time of the year when it might be wise to postpone your travel plans entirely. Here's our seasonal guide to help you make the right decision for you. Thailand never gets cold, but by November, the rain stops and cold fronts bring the temperatures down a notch (at night at least). This ushers in the “cool” season and officially marks the start of Thailand's high season when it comes to travel. And while the city is at its busiest over the Christmas and New Year weeks, there’s a lot more on offer in the way of tours, trips and cultural festivals that do a good job at dispersing crowds. Visit Chiang Mai at this time and you’ll see locals wearing sweaters as nighttime temperatures drop to 12–15°C (53–60°F) while sunseekers from cooler climes opt for shorts and loose tees. Yet wherever your bar sits, the cooler weather guarantees to make outdoor activities more bearable. During this time, parks and rivers that shut during the rainy season reopen, while the country’s highest mountain, Doi Inthanon, is even prone to a touch of morning frost. While there are plenty of peaks in Thailand where you can enjoy a sea of clouds – think Phu Chee Fah, Doi Pha Hom Pok or Doi Angkhang – there’s no place better than atop the towering pinnacle of Doi Luang Chiang Dao. Open for just November, December and January and limited to 150 people a day, it does take some planning, but the 360 views at sunset and sunrise are entirely worth it. The booking website is mainly in Thai, so try sending a message through the Facebook group to secure your space.

While that makes for an incredible trip, it can be tricky for first-timers to figure out the best place to base themselves. It all depends on what you want to do and who you're traveling with. Are you downing cafecitos and cocktails before salsa dancing into the wee hours or kayaking and stretching out on a beautiful stretch of sand to relax? The best neighborhood for families is unlikely to have a thumping nightlife, but some areas offer a little bit of something for everyone. Think about your must-do priorities in Magic City (if you're in need of inspiration, check out our favorite things to do there) and let our guide to Miami's neighborhoods help you choose the best possible base for your vacation. If you want to get a taste of nearly everything the city has to offer, Downtown Miami is ideal. Marvel at some of the city's most historic buildings, dating as far back as the 1890s – among them, the Olympia Theater (originally a silent movie theater) and the Freedom Tower (once a help center for Cuban refugees in the 1960s and 70s). Spend some time exploring and snapping photos, then learn more about the city's past at the HistoryMiami Museum. But downtown is far from stuck in the past. Aside from the high rises, there are restaurants and retail to enjoy at Bayside Marketplace, plus boat tours on Biscayne Bay and a Ferris wheel that offers dazzling views of the neighborhood. Fancy some culture? The Pérez Art Museum boasts a robust collection of art from Latin America and beyond, while the adjacent Frost Science Museum is home to a spectacular aquarium, planetarium and rotating exhibits. And if that's not enough, you can always see what's happening at the Kaseya Center, home of the Miami Heat and a major entertainment venue. Formerly known as Little San Juan, this once-heavily Puerto Rican neighborhood has undergone tremendous change, most notably because of gentrification. Today, it's an international hub of art, fashion and design. Brilliant murals adorn nearly every building facade, many of which were created by top street artists like Shepard Fairey and Atomik. Throw a stone in any direction, and you're sure to hit an art gallery, cocktail bar, vintage shop, uber-hip clothing boutique or even a taco shop that doubles as a speakeasy. While there's a dearth of hotels in the area, you can book a room at the Moxy, Arlo or an Airbnb. Otherwise, venture into the neighborhood at your leisure and make a day of it by picking up an iced latte at Panther Coffee before wandering between the Wynwood Walls, Museum of Graffiti and The Art of Hip Hop. The vibe changes to adults-only at night – enjoy a delicious meal at Kush or Bakan, then bar hop between R House, Dirty Rabbit, Gramps or any other spot where the music's good. Surely the most visited area of Miami, South Beach continues to draw crowds for several reasons. First, it's the best neighborhood for beach access no matter where you stay – many hotels offer private access and even those that don't often offer amenities like chairs and umbrellas. Traveling with kids? Stay near South Point Park – they'll love the splash pads and waving to outgoing cruise ships from the pier. Prefer something more lively? Anywhere along Ocean Drive or even Washington Ave is excellent. Speaking of lively, the nightlife in South Beach is hard to beat. Popular staples like Mango's, The Clevelander and Nikki Beach are always a good time, but feel free to branch out. Do Not Sit On The Furniture is a small club with huge tunes delivered by guest DJs, while M2 gives you that bass-all-over-your-body immersive party experience. And if dives are more your scene, you can't go wrong with a night at the infamous Mac's Club Deuce (if it was good enough for Anthony Bourdain, it's good enough for us). Check out our favorite beaches – beyond South Beach Little Havana has plenty to offer in terms of culture and charm. Drive (or walk) along the infamous Calle Ocho, and you'll be greeted by giant, colorful rooster statues – a nod to the actual roosters that stroll about the area. While there, check out the Cuban Walk of Fame to see the names of some of the biggest stars from the island nation. Follow up with a visit to the Cubaocho Museum for some history lessons as well as a chance to peruse art. But the best thing about Little Havana? Hands down the opportunity to enjoy so many tasty dishes. Yes, this is understandably the best spot for Cuban cuisine and from Versailles to Sanguich, El Pub to El Rey de las Fritas – it's all delicious. But it's not just Cuban food on the menu – try Salvadoran food at El Atlakat, Nicaraguan food at Pinolandia or Yambo, or stop at La Casa de las Baleadas for Honduran fare. Your tastebuds will thank you. If you'd like to experience some of Miami's lesser-known gems, spend some time in Coconut Grove. Quieter than SoBe but still plenty lively, the Grove is Miami's oldest neighborhood. Take a glimpse into the city's past at Barnacle Historic State Park (built in 1891, at a time when Miami was only accessible by boat). Another must-see attraction is Vizcaya Museum & Gardens – this stunning waterfront villa, built in 1916, will make you feel like you've been transported to the Mediterranean. And if the weather's right, a stroll through the verdant Kampong Botanical Garden is a must. Wander over to CocoWalk to experience the modern side of the Grove, an open-air center with boutique shops, restaurants, bars, a movie theater and more. While much of this area has been revamped in recent years, many beloved old staples are still around: delightful French bistro Le Bouchon du Grove, GreenStreet Cafe (known for their incomparable brunches), Barracuda and Sandbar (popular drinking holes), The Last Carrot (perfect for healthy food options) and El Taquito (an excellent taqueria that's open late). Make sure you check the calendar because the Grove hosts all kinds of fun events, from farmer's markets to open-air concerts. If you're looking for a relaxing beach getaway with the kids, you simply can't go wrong with Key Biscayne. It's like a little world unto itself, with just one major road to get from one end to the other. Accommodations aren't plentiful – the Ritz Carlton is one of the few hotels in the area – but there are always Airbnbs available for the whole family (and you can still visit the Ritz for spa time). Once there, you can divide your time between Crandon Park and Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park. The former features one of the city's best Nature Centers, a mangrove boardwalk, guided hikes, plus plenty of space to enjoy the beach. Kiteboarding, kayaking and other eco-adventure tours are also available here. The beaches at Bill Baggs are just as lovely, with opportunities to explore the on-site lighthouse, as well as go fishing, hiking, swimming, paddling and biking (single and quad bikes are available for rent). And if you're traveling with a four-legged friend, nearby Hobie Beach (near adjacent Virginia Key) is also a great place to spend a few hours. Add these top experiences to your itinerary

In this edition, Chamidae Ford shows us how far her money went on a long weekend in Copenhagen, Denmark. I recently spent a sunny weekend in Copenhagen – a city known for its stunning architecture, signature design and burgeoning food scene – with my friend and coworker Ann Douglas. When planning this trip, I knew I’d only be there for a few days, and I also knew I wanted to taste delicious food and shop for a few souvenirs (or more than a few). As someone who lives in New York, I must acknowledge that my sense of what is deemed overpriced and what is ""normal"" is a bit skewed. Still, I will bare my spending soul if only to offer a grasp on what a weekend in this city may cost if you enjoy yourself rather than convert prices on a currency app. A goal for me was to do as little pre-trip spending as possible. Since I was already in Dublin for work, I took a short flight costing 679kr to Copenhagen.  For the hotel, I wanted a place that felt young and prioritized design, so it truly felt like we were in Copenhagen. I also looked for something central to avoid long commute times when visiting the main sites. We stayed at 25 Hours Hotel in Indre By, a pricier option but in a great location, and we split the cost of the room. For three nights, our stay was 5408kr, which means my portion was 2704kr, which I paid for with credit card points I had been saving. Pre-trip spending: 697kr Airport transfer: We landed in Copenhagen around 4:30pm, and we discovered that one of Copenhagen's finest perks is how straightforward it is to get from the airport to the city! Doing the same in London, Paris, or New York is a pricey, timely and exhausting feat; this was cheap (30kr) and fast. I got from the airport to my hotel in roughly 20 minutes. Activities: With a dinner reservation for 8pm (you must make dinner reservations in advance; Copenhagen is not the place for walk-ins), we spent a few hours taking in the early evening, the winding streets, and noting places we would like to visit the next day.  Apertivo: We stopped at Little Green Door, a cocktail bar along the canal, for a pre-dinner drink. We each enjoyed a single shot, gin and tonic for a whopping 131kr (262kr for both). After swiping my card, this was the moment I knew my weekend was going to be more expensive than I had anticipated. Dinner: In the evening, we dined at the intimate yet bustling Lilo Vinoria, a chic wine bar with Italian-inspired food and an extensive drink menu. I am unsure if it was because I had only consumed a single croissant that day due to travel or because I was coming off a week of pub food in Dublin, but this meal felt like everything I had ever needed.

This enchanting beach town nestled between two mountains is perhaps the one town on the Amalfi Coast that has stayed most true to its original medieval structure.

To engage in more sustainable tourism, try to avoid visiting in August, when Atrani is undoubtedly busiest and most crowded.  During the summer months, the Amalfi Coast welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors; this tourist gold rush benefits the local economy, but it’s important to also note the negative impact that overtourism has had. Some towns, including Atrani, have become physically and economically inaccessible at times because of how crowded they are, with prices skyrocketing due to all establishments being filled to the brink.

We asked two travel writers to make the case for the Canadian city closest to their hearts.,"Heading to Canada? You're in for a treat. However, it is the second-largest country in the world, and you won't be able to visit it all on one trip. Some sacrifices have to be made, which might include making a choice between the two largest cities. Should you base yourself in arty, festive Montréal, with its beautiful parks and welcoming vibe? Or should it be the diverse and energetic city of Toronto, with its delightfully varied food scene? We asked two travel writers to make the case for the Canadian city closest to their hearts. Though born in Ottawa, Joel Balsam has spent more than a decade living in Montréal on and off, and his father was born there. Joel also wrote the Québec chapter in the upcoming Lonely Planet Canada guidebook. As Canadians like to say: Toronto is where you work, Montréal is where you live. So as a traveler are you trying to dive into the grind or live it up? The latter? Yep, that’s what I thought. Toronto is all go, go, go, with huge skyscrapers and people who won’t stop to chat because they’re hustling to afford their rent or mortgage. It’s like Manhattan, but not quite as cool. Sadly, this has made Toronto the loneliest city in Canada. Meanwhile, Montréal has joie de vivre. A je ne sais quoi, as it were. Instead of talking about housing unaffordability, Montrealers discuss art, concerts and fun (also the ever-present road construction and language laws, but nobody’s perfect). Montréal’s streets are filled with free festivals all summer long, including Complètement Cirque, Mural and Festival International de Jazz. There’s always something fascinating to see at Musée des Beaux-Arts or Quartiers des Spectacles, and there are a near-infinite number of hip bars and clubs. Some people even call Montréal “Little Berlin,” affirming its happening status. Since Montréal was built mostly before cars, it’s more walkable than Toronto and many of its main thoroughfares are pedestrianized every summer. Just try and walk around Old Montréal’s tiny alleys without feeling a tingle of romance. The ruelles vertes (literally “green streets”), back alleys in neighborhoods like the Plateau and Villeray, are verdant, semi-secret ways to get around town.
