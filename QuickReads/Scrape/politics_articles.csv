500,Politics,Modi leads BJP counter-charge to quash Opposition claims of ‘changes in Constitution’,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/modi-bjp-counter-charge-opposition-claims-constitution-9292690/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/modi-constitution-1.jpg?w=450,"APRIL 26, 2024",The party's high-decibel offensive includes questioning moves by Congress govts in quota provisions to include Muslims,"For some time now, the INDIA bloc, especially the Congress, has been pitching its battle against the BJP as one to “save the Constitution”. Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP has now taken the fight into the rival camp, accusing the Congress of having, in fact, altered the statute with changes in the reservation promised to SC/STs to benefit Muslims. As the election season gets into right earnest, this is one of the key issues being raised by Modi to target the Congress, as part of the BJP’s larger claims against the party of appeasement towards the minority community. BJP sources admit that the strategy is deliberate, with the party realising that its target of “400 paar (more than 400)” Lok Sabha seats was being projected by INDIA as the first step towards “changing” the Constitution. Specifically, the INDIA messaging has been targeted at SC/STs, with Dalit voters in some parts expressing apprehension about “Babasaheb Ambedkar’s Constitution” being changed. Remarks by some BJP leaders, including candidates in the Lok Sabha polls, suggesting changes in the Constitution only gave the Opposition more ammunition. A BJP leader said they had got feedback from the ground that tribals, besides the minorities and Dalits, were raising questions about the issue. Party leaders also feared that the impression that the BJP could change the Constitution would hurt it in southern states, where it is already looked upon with suspicion by many as a North-centric, majoritarian party. It was then that Modi himself took charge. If, in Gaya, the PM said that even Ambedkar “cannot change the Constitution”, Union Home Minister Amit Shah pointed out in an interview to NDTV that if the BJP wanted to change the statute, it would have done so in the 10 years that it has been in power with absolute majority. “The Congress has a habit of misusing its majority, not us,” Shah said. The counter-offensive, putting the Congress on the spot over quota changes, has followed since. BJP sources said the high-decibel counter-attack is to ensure that the Opposition has no ground left to attack it over the Constitution issue, even if it brings up instances from the past to attack the Modi government. For example, a 2015 advertisement ahead of Republic Day issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting featuring the Preamble without the words “socialist” and “secular”. As controversy followed, BJP ministers had assured that the government had no intention to make any changes in the Preamble, while pointing out that the words had themselves been inserted by the Indira Gandhi government through the 42nd Amendment. Then Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said there was no “harm” in a debate on the issue, and that the image shared by the I&B Ministry was actually of the “original” Preamble. The BJP and RSS have earlier too questioned these changes carried out during the Emergency by the Indira-led Congress government, including a change in the words “unity of the nation” to “unity and integrity of the nation” in the Preamble. Interestingly, the Preamble whose copies were distributed to MPs ahead of the inauguration of the new Parliament building last year also had the words “socialist” and “secular” missing. Again, the government argued that it had shared the “original version” of the Preamble. In between, in 2021, BJP MP K J Alphons moved a motion to introduce a Constitution (Amendment) Bill in the Upper House to amend the Preamble. But when the Bill was to be taken up in February 2022, Alphons was not present in the Rajya Sabha, and hence it was not discussed. During the term of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government, a National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution led by Venkatachaliah Commission was set up in February 2000. Its mandate was to examine “in the light of the experience of the past 50 years as to how best the Constitution can respond to the changing needs of an efficient, smooth and effective system of governance and socio-economic development of a modern India within the framework of the parliamentary democracy” and to recommend changes. Although Vajpayee had clarified that the basic features of the Constitution would not be tinkered with, many had raised doubts about the government’s intent as the statement was issued after K R Narayanan, India’s first Dalit President, warned that there was no need to change the basic features. The BJP has earlier burned its hands over the reservation issue, after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said there could be a review of the provision. Since then, both the BJP and RSS have repeatedly asserted their commitment to reservation for SCs and STs. As for Modi, party leaders argue that he is the last one who needs a certificate to show his commitment to the Constitution, being the PM under whom November 25 has come to be celebrated as Constitution Day.

501,Politics,"Eye on Assembly polls, eager not to blunt Art 370 narrative, wary BJP keeps out of Kashmir",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bjp-kashmir-anantnag-rajouri-lok-sabha-polls-pdp-pdap-article370-9292572/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/1-2024-04-26T193255.098.jpg?w=450,"APRIL 26, 2024","PM made his first visit to Kashmir post scrapping of special status in March, raising expectations that the party would field candidates, especially in the altered Anantnag seat.","The list of political parties which have approached the Election Commission seeking deferment of polls in Kashmir’s Anantnag-Rajouri Lok Sabha seat, 10 days before it votes on May 7, includes the BJP. The other three are the J&K Apni Party, the People’s Conference and the Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP). At a time when the BJP is not contesting any of the three seats in Kashmir, after a build-up that included a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March (his first to Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370), the development deepens confusion over the party’s plans in the Valley. On April 16, speaking in Jammu’s Reasi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah first indicated that the party might not contest in Kashmir when he said the BJP is “not in a hurry to see the lotus bloom in the Valley”. He went on to urge voters not to back National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) or Congress candidates. “We are not going to ‘conquer’ Kashmir as projected by our adversaries. We want to win every heart in Kashmir,” Shah said. The BJP’s decision followed the failure of the INDIA bloc parties NC and PDP to come to an agreement in the Valley. In Jammu, both the NC and PDP are backing the Congress. This means that Kashmir’s mainstream political parties are now pitted against each other in the Valley. While it is expected to be a direct fight between the NC and PDP in Srinagar and in Anantnag-Rajouri (from where PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti is contesting), in Baramulla, the NC’s Omar Abdullah is facing Peoples Conference’s leader Sajad Lone. Sources in the BJP say that this serves the party well, both in deepening the fault lines between the NC and PDP as well as preparing the ground for it for the Assembly elections, which are scheduled to be held by September, as per Supreme Court orders. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had contested all the seats in Jammu and Kashmir – winning two seats of Jammu and one of Ladakh (it was part of J&K at the time), while putting up a poor show in Kashmir. Its best show was in Anantnag, at 8.15% of the votes. Assembly elections were last held in J&K in 2016, making the Lok Sabha polls the first major election to be held in Kashmir post-Article 370 abrogation in August 2019. Many expected the BJP to make the most of it, especially given its improved chances in Anantnag, now called Anantnag-Rajouri, after the addition of areas from the Jammu districts of Poonch and Rajouri. However, BJP insiders say that the developments post-Article 370 were precisely the reason the party is approaching 2024 differently. “In 2019, we knew we don’t have much support in the Valley,” a party leader says. “Since the abrogation (of special status), the BJP has built a narrative that the people in Jammu as well as Kashmir are happy. We have talked about a ‘Naya Kashmir’. But not all people agree… If we had not got sufficient votes, it would have been a blow to our narrative,” the leader says. With Rajouri and Poonch areas included, and parts of Pulwama and Shopian excluded, the political equations have dramatically changed in the Anantnag-Rajouri parliamentary seat. The PDP has called the changes a deliberate move to “rob the PDP of its political base”, as these are seen to have strengthened the BJP’s position. In months to go before the elections, the Centre cleared a long-standing promise of reservation for the Pahari community, now in substantial numbers in Anantnag-Rajouri. However, sources say that ultimately, the BJP’s calculation was that the constituency remained risky even after the changes, given that a majority of its voters are still Muslims. A high turnout from the Kashmiri side of the seat, which is expected given the eagerness for a chance to exercise opinion post-Article 370, could make the BJP plans go awry. Against this backdrop, Shah’s appeal to voters against choosing the NC, PDP or the Congress is being read as a signal of the BJP’s support to parties in the Valley often referred to as the Centre’s proxy by their opponents. When Ghulam Nabi Azad, who founded the DPAP after leaving the Congress, declared his intent to contest from Anantnag-Rajouri, talk went around that he was the BJP’s candidate for the seat. Azad belongs to the Jammu region and it made more sense for him to contest from Udhampur, his home constituency. But Azad later dropped out in favour of the lesser-known Advocate Saleem Parray of his party, reportedly after getting feelers that he wasn’t likely to get much support even from the Paharis, as he was seen as an “outsider”. The Pahari vote in Anantnag-Rajouri is now expected to split between the NC, PDP and the Apni Party’s Zafar Iqbal Manhas, a Pahari leader. Any party that can attract the most Pahari votes is likely to have an edge. The Apni Party, which was formed in 2021 apparently with the Centre’s blessing, and People’s Conference, which is seen as close to the Centre, have already announced support for each other. The BJP’s opponents are watching the developments, especially in Anantnag-Rajouri, with much interest. “They didn’t have much stakes in the Valley,” says a PDP leader. “But after delimitation and after pitting the Gujjar and Pahari communities against each other (on account of the reservation), they have managed what they wanted for the long term. While there were social fault lines between the Gujjars, Paharis, Shias and Sunnis, they didn’t impact politics, which is why a Gujjar leader like Mian Altaf could win earlier from the Kangan Assembly segment, where a majority are ethnic Kashmiris.” Mian Altaf, who is a Gujjar spiritual leader with a large following in the community, is now the NC candidate from Anantnag-Rajouri. Asked about the BJP’s decision not to field candidates in Kashmir, its J&K chief Ravinder Raina said at a press conference in Jammu last week: “Sometimes decisions are made to achieve a big goal.” He also said that the BJP would support “patriotic” parties in the Valley. Party sources say that what Raina meant by “a bigger goal” was the Assembly elections. “We know we are not strong enough at this point in Kashmir. So we decided to support candidates who are in a better position to take on the NC, PDP and Congress… It will also help us forge stronger alliances for the Assembly elections, which are more important to the party than the three parliamentary seats,” a party leader says.

So much so that while addressing a public meeting at Kaliachak in Malda district on Tuesday, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee slammed Mitra-Chaudhary and called her “behaya (shameless)”. The National Commission for Women (NCW) on Wednesday wrote a letter to the state DGP seeking an action taken report on the alleged derogatory remarks of the TMC MP and party No 2 against the BJP candidate, who is better known as “Nirbhaya Didi (fearless Didi) ”. Mitra-Chaudhary, the sitting BJP MLA from the English Bazar Assembly segment in Malda, is contesting against the Congress’s Isha Khan Choudhury and the TMC’s Shahnawaz Ali Raihan. The Congress candidate is the son of sitting MP Abu Hasem Khan Choudhury who has won the seat since 2009. Known popularly as Dalu da, he is the brother of former Union Minister and Congress stalwart A B A Ghani Khan Choudhury. The TMC candidate is an Oxford scholar who was a prominent voice against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Chaudhary is a former journalist, social worker and women’s rights activist. In 2004, she took part in the launch of the National Legal Literacy Mission. In 2008, she served as national advisor of the National Legal Services Authority under the Ministry of Law and Justice. After the 2012 Delhi gang rape, she chaired the special task force on rape, trafficking and violence against women set up by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. That’s how she got the “Nirbhaya Didi” moniker. In December 2013, she resigned from the post amid speculation that she could contest the election from Malda as a TMC candidate. However, she was named TMC candidate from the South Delhi Lok Sabha seat, where she polled only 803 votes. “I had started the ‘Nirbhaya gram (fearless village)’ initiative, which was a social movement to protect the dignity of women. The initiative was well received, and people gave me the ‘Nirbhaya Didi’ name. Today, more people know me as Nirbhaya Didi than by my real name,” said Chaudhary. Two years later, Chaudhary joined the BJP. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, she lost from Maldaha Dakshin by over 8,000 votes. Then, in the 2021 state polls, she won from English Bazar that is part of the Lok Sabha seat. The constituency has been filled with pink hoardings and placards in a unique campaign. While some have photographs of PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah alongside Chaudhary’s image, others have the images of PM Modi and her. All the pink placards have “Vote for Nirbhaya Di” written on them. The pink banners also adorn her vehicles. “We have selected pink as our theme, as it signifies the power of women. We have made pink pamphlets, posters, banners, hoardings and placards. ‘Vote for Nibhaya Di’ means voting for safety, security and protection of women,” said the BJP candidate. Although the constituency is known as a Congress stronghold, the BJP candidate’s campaign has caught the attention of people. “Her campaigning style has caught the eye of the people who are relating to her brand of politics. Her previous experience of fighting for women’s rights has given her an edge over her rivals, so it is going to be a tough contest this time,” said a TMC leader from Malda on condition of anonymity. The BJP leadership has backed her with a roadshow by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Malda town on April 23, followed by a public meeting by PM Modi earlier on Friday. Maldaha Dakshin goes to the polls in the third phase on May 7.

Javadekar, the central BJP leader in charge of Kerala, hit out at state Congress president K Sudhakaran who, on Friday, targeted the Left over Jayarajan’s “plans” to jump ship. “It is bogus news.

Though Sobha Surendran, the BJP candidate from Alappuzha, did not name Javadekar, she said on Thursday that Jayarajan had held talks with the BJP. A few days earlier, she claimed that discussions with the CPI(M) leader were held in Delhi. “Did Sobha say I met Jayarajan? How does Sobha know who I meet or talk to?” Javadekar said. Jayarajan has dismissed Surendran’s claims as “utter lies” but admitted that he met Javadekar in Thiruvananthapuram. “I met him at my son’s flat.

The BJP has targeted Fernandes for saying that the Constitution had been “imposed” on Goa. The ruling party has accused the Congress of insulting the Constitution and making a “calculated move to break the nation”, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi bringing this up recently. “The Congress candidate is saying clearly that the Constitution was forced on Goa… Is this not an insult to Babasaheb Ambedkar and the Constitution? Today, they are rejecting the Constitution in Goa, tomorrow these people will commit the sin of rejecting it in the entire country,” Modi said at a rally in Chhattisgarh on Wednesday. At a corner meeting in Betalbatim in the Nuvem Assembly segment of South Goa, Fernandes on Monday recalled a discussion on dual citizenship with then Congress president Rahul Gandhi ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He was then a member of a citizens’ collective called “Goencho Awaz (Voice of Goa)”. “We placed 12 demands before him and one of them was regarding dual citizenship. When he asked me if the move was constitutional, I explained to him that the Constitution was adopted in 1950 while Goa was liberated from Portuguese rule only in 1961 and the Constitution was imposed on us. When the Constitution was adopted, Goa was not a part of India,” he said. Fernandes said he told Rahul that Goans acquire Portuguese citizenship due to a lack of jobs in Goa. “They go abroad, support their families and more importantly, they send remittances. Rahul said that I had a point.” Portugal offers those born in Goa before December 19, 1961 — the day Goa was liberated from Portuguese rule — and two future generations the option of registering as its citizens. Since a Portuguese passport provides the holder visa-free entry to several countries, including the United Kingdom and the European Union, many in Goa in the last few decades have been transcribing their births in the Central Registry in Lisbon and acquiring Portuguese citizenship to avail employment and educational opportunities. The issue gained prominence in the past year after Indian authorities stopped issuing surrender certificates, rendering many Goans ineligible for Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status. Earlier this month, two Goans filed petitions in the Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court after their Indian passports were revoked by the regional passport office in Panaji. Hours after Fernandes’s remarks, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant accused him of “undermining the Constitution”. On Wednesday, the BJP filed a complaint with the Goa Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) demanding Fernandes’s disqualification for violating the Model Code of Conduct. It accused Fernandes of having views “that stink of anti-national and divisive mentality, which were detrimental to the democratic and social fabric of the country”. Mormugao BJP MLA Sankalp Amonkar has filed a police complaint against the Congress candidate. Fernandes is a retired naval officer and a Kargil war veteran who received the Vijay Star medal. He was preferred by the Congress over sitting South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha for the polls. He joined the Congress ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls and made his debut from Dabolim, losing out narrowly to the BJP’s Mauvin Godinho. In the parliamentary elections, he will lock horns with Pallavi Dempo, the first woman in Goa to contest the Lok Sabha polls as a BJP nominee. Fernandes told The Indian Express that he did not use the word “forced”. “The Constitution has stood the test of time and has held India together. My only contention is that there should have been some provision or special status to ensure the protection of Goa’s land, culture, and Goan interests. If that had been done, today the Prime Minister and the BJP would not have sold our land and destroyed Goa’s identity. I spoke about safeguarding Goa’s identity,” he said. Accusing Modi of “murdering the Constitution”, he challenged him for a debate on the issue. “You are challenging a soldier who has served for 26 years in the Navy? I have the highest regard for the Constitution and the armed forces. When I joined the Navy, I took an oath on the very Constitution that you are trying to amend,” he said. The Goa Congress has thrown its weight behind Fernandes and accused the BJP of “misinterpreting and doctoring” his speech to mislead people. “He was raising the dual citizenship issue, which had been raised by former Goa CM Manohar Parrikar in the past. Does that make what Parrikar said unconstitutional?” said Goa Congress chief Amit Patkar.

The senior Congress leader has been determined to ensure there is no repeat as Vaibhav contests from Jalore this time. The “revelations” of Gehlot’s former OSD Lokesh Sharma then, days before polling in Jalore on Friday, could not have had worse timing. And they did not take long trickling down to the constituency. Narpat Singh, 61, a retired teacher sitting outside a tea shop in Jalore zila parishad, says that while Vaibhav may be putting up a tough fight still, the BJP is on a strong footing in Jalore. “Moreover, the Congress will lose whatever little support it has among youth because of revelations by Gehlot’s OSD.” On Wednesday, Sharma claimed, among other things, that Gehlot had tried to protect the accused in the paper leaks during his tenure, including the then Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education Chairman Dharmpal Jaroli. The BJP has made the paper leaks a big issue, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a mention of it in his speech in Agra on Thursday, raising Sharma’s claims. Late in the evening, in his first remarks on the “revelations”, Gehlot asked what proof did the PM have. However, in Jalore, some have doubts. If unemployment is a big issue, Narpat says, it is because of paper leaks under the Gehlot government. Ironically, education is one of the common points in political conversations in Jalore, especially since the BJP’s Lumbaram Choudhary, 59, finished his Class 10 only in 2016, while Vaibhav has two degrees from ILS Law College in Pune. Sitting next to Narpat, Shrawan Nath, 38, who hails from the SC Kalbelia caste, says Vaibhav is well-educated and can put forward the constituency’s issues more articulately, unlike Lumbaram. Velaram Sankhla, 49, a member of the same Mali community as the Gehlots, agrees, saying: “The last time this Lok Sabha seat witnessed development was in 1999, when Buta Singh (former Union Home Minister) was an MP from here.” For Hariram Rathore, also a retired teacher, there is another factor at play. Hariram hails from the Rajput community; the remarks by Union minister and BJP candidate from Rajkot, Gujarat, Parshottam Rupala about Rajputs that have triggered protests there have also had a fallout in Jalore, which shares its border with Gujarat. The two candidates have engaged Rajput leaders into the campaign – Vaibhav to cash in on their anger, and Lumbaram to contain the damage. Chandan Singh, 45, a Rajput and former BJP councillor, admits the community is backing Vaibhav. He also questions the BJP decision to replace its sitting MP of 15 years, Devji Patel, with his aide and fellow community member (Kalbi OBC, the largest group in the Jalore seat) as candidate. “Are there no other castes here? And what did Patel do in 15 years?” Singh asks. The BJP has traditionally relied on major OBC groups in Jalore, including Kalbis and Debasis. However, Rajputs too have stood by it. Apart from Rajputs, Vaibhav is relying on consolidation of non-Kalbi OBC castes and SC/STs. A Congress leader says: “OBCs such as Darzi, Nai, Kumhar, Lohar, Mali are now shifting from the BJP towards the Congress… The angry Rajputs too are moving because our MLA from Bheemal here, Samarjit Singh, is a Rajput.” BJP district president Shravan Singh Rao, though, is confident of the party retaining “all the OBC votes” – which he puts at 10 lakh in Jalore – apart from getting the support of Rajputs and Purohits. According to Rao, this is because Vaibhav is an “outsider”. “And when Vaibhav could not win in his home turf with the help of his father as sitting CM, how can he win in Jalore which is a BJP stronghold?” Lumbaram, in contrast, has risen up the ranks, says Rao. “He is a regular person, a farmer. And since he has been a party worker for 40 years, the entire organisation is working for him. People also want to see Modi ji again. Vaibhav’s candidature is a promotion of parivaarvaad (nepotism).” To counter the “outsider” narrative, Vaibhav’s wife Himanshi – apart from their daughter – has been hard at work, promising voters to set up a home in Jalore if he wins, whose doors “will always be open”. But if Lumbaram’s son-of-the-soil narrative is to his advantage, for the youth the fact that at 43, Vaibhav is 26 years younger than the BJP rival, is striking a chord. Then there is Gehlot’s own clout, with the former CM lending his weight along with that of his senior confidants to swing a win. It’s a prestige fight after Vaibhav’s 2019 loss from Jodhpur to senior BJP leader Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, an arch Gehlot rival. Among those looking at Vaibhav are locals Jahangir Khan, 32, and Mohamad Arif, 30, belonging to hardcore Congress families, as well as young government employees on Bagoda Road, who cite the Gehlot government returning to the Old Pension Scheme. “Modi’s craze was in 2014,” one of them says. Jagdish Bansal, who runs a cyber café at the age of 72, has seen worlds change. But there has been one constant, according to him. “The people of Jalore don’t disclose their preferences. And if most of them are saying one of them is winning, then he is certainly going to lose.”      "," The “revelations” of Gehlot’s former OSD Lokesh Sharma then, days before polling in Jalore on Friday, could not have had worse timing. Narpat Singh, 61, a retired teacher sitting outside a tea shop in Jalore zila parishad, says that while Vaibhav may be putting up a tough fight still, the BJP is on a strong footing in Jalore. “Moreover, the Congress will lose whatever little support it has among youth because of revelations by Gehlot’s OSD.” On Wednesday, Sharma claimed, among other things, that Gehlot had tried to protect the accused in the paper leaks during his tenure, including the then Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education Chairman Dharmpal Jaroli."

But the appeal of Modi may be too strong to breach.","Two-time BJP MP Om Birla is facing a tough contest in his Kota Lok Sabha seat, which votes on April 26. One reason is his “absence” from his constituency during his last term, in which he served as the Lok Sabha Speaker. The second is his challenger, the Congress’s Prahlad Gunjal, a former BJP leader and Vasundhara Raje loyalist. “Birla was not seen in the constituency for the last five years. Now that elections are here, he is touring, taking Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s name,” says Mahesh Bairwa, a resident of Rangpur village. Residents say all of Birla’s visits to Kota since 2019 have been restricted to public meetings in the city, with the MP barely touching rural areas. Suresh Meena, a resident of Nayagaon village, who calls himself an “ardent” follower of Modi, says he will vote this time for Gunjal. “He is a powerful leader, connected to the ground, and is contesting elections on local issues.” Gunjal is believed to have left the BJP for the Congress due to growing differences with Birla. The two leaders, who started their political journey at the same time, were caught in a tussle for dominance over the city. As Raje lost his clout in the state unit, so did Gunjal in Kota. The Congress was happy to receive him as it did not have any suitable candidate against Birla. A Congress leader, speaking anonymously, said: “The entry of Gunjal has energised the ranks. Kota was seen as a one-sided competition.” However, the leader said, their main challenge is the enduring appeal of Modi. A few BJP supporters in Barodiya village, for example, say that while they have no love lost for Birla, they will vote for him to get Modi back as PM. Birla’s campaign too has mostly talked about the Modi government’s “achievements”, including Ram Mandir and the abrogation of Article 370. The Congress appears to have bridged some of the gap between the BJP and it here. In 2019, Birla won by more than 2.6 lakh votes. However, in the 2023 Assembly elections, the Congress won four Assembly segments falling in the Kota Lok Sabha seat, the same as the BJP. The Congress is hoping Gunjal will get a majority of the votes of his Gujjar community, plus the Meena tribal and Muslim votes. Along with the three, Rajputs, who have been unhappy with the BJP in the state, and Scheduled Castes are some prominent castes in the area. To help Birla with the Meena voters, their tallest leader in the state and minister Kirori Lal Meena toured Kota. Gunjal told The Indian Express he was thankful to the Congress for accepting him “with open arms”. “There is no place for leadership in the BJP… There were some issues between Om Birla and me. I wanted the senior leadership to resolve them, but they did not pay heed. For my self-respect, I decided to leave the BJP,” Gunjal said, adding that people have been telling him they are “fed up” with the functioning of Birla. “They want change and I am here for that.” However, it has not been all smooth sailing for Gunjal in the Congress, with one of those openly expressing their displeasure being the party’s sitting Kota MLA, Shanti Dhariwal, a known rival of Gunjal. The two have not been seen in public together since a spat between them on stage at a rally. What will help Birla is the BJP’s powerful ground network, and the fact that his fate hangs on how people see Modi. A BJP worker in Kota said that will prove enough. “Birla will win, though the victory margin may be not more than 1 lakh votes.”      "," Two-time BJP MP Om Birla is facing a tough contest in his Kota Lok Sabha seat, which votes on April 26. Suresh Meena, a resident of Nayagaon village, who calls himself an “ardent” follower of Modi, says he will vote this time for Gunjal. “He is a powerful leader, connected to the ground, and is contesting elections on local issues.” Gunjal is believed to have left the BJP for the Congress due to growing differences with Birla.

A Bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta is scheduled to pronounce its verdict on a batch of pleas seeking the complete cross-verification of votes cast using Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails, or VVPATs. The VVPAT machine is attached to the ballot unit of the EVM and provides visual verification for a voter’s vote by printing a slip of paper with the voter’s choice on it. This is later used to verify votes cast in five randomly selected polling booths per Assembly segment. The Opposition has been demanding that all VVPAT slips be cross-checked with the EVM votes. In context: In recent years, questions have been raised time and again on the integrity of EVMs and the demand to count 100% VVPAT slips is because those in favour of it believe it will make the voting process more transparent. In 2019, when TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu moved the Supreme Court demanding that 50% randomised VVPAT slips be counted — after these proceedings, the court increased the number of polling booths in which the votes would be verified from one to five — the EC had argued it would delay results by five to six days. In December, the Opposition INDIA alliance, which includes the Congress, the CPI(M), the CPI, the Trinamool Congress, the DMK, and the Samajwadi Party, passed a resolution demanding 100% verification of VVPAT slips. They argue that ensuring everyone believes in the fairness of the electoral process outweighs the concerns of a delay in declaring the results.

Several of the constituencies of Nagaon, Diphu, Darrang-Udalguri, Silchar, and Karimganj have undergone significant changes in last year’s delimitation exercise. The decisive role expected to be played by Bengali Muslim voters in this phase has borne an unusual sight. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the BJP’s primary campaigner in Assam — who has in the past declared that the BJP “does not need Miya (a pejorative term for Bengali Muslims) votes in 2024” — has been focusing on the large turnouts at his rallies in Bengali Muslim-majority areas such as Dhing, Laharighat, Rupohi, and Hailakandi. “When elections come, I will myself request them not to vote for us. Vote for us only after you follow family planning, stop child marriage, and shed fundamentalism,” Sarma told reporters last October. On Wednesday, he told a large gathering in Laharighat, a Bengali Muslim majority area in Nagaon, “This is a BJP meeting, you all tell me how many Muslims are here. Outside Assam, people won’t believe that 50,000 Muslims attended a BJP meeting. Today in Assam, everyone has one voice, be it Hindu or Muslim. ‘Ab ki baar, Modi Sarkar (Next time, we will elect a Modi government)’.”  He also claimed that the BJP had given a boost to development “without appeasement”, declaring that the BJP’s welfare schemes were reaching all citizens, including Muslims. The number of Muslim voters – mostly Bengali-speaking – in Nagaon has increased to well over 50% after the three Assembly segments of Dhing, Rupahihat and Samaguri were transferred to it from the erstwhile Kaliabor seat and other segments were removed. Nagaon was sought by multiple Congress ticket aspirants, including, as per reports, Gaurav Gogoi who later contested from Jorhat after sitting Congress MP Prodyut Bordoloi secured the ticket. Against Bordoloi, the BJP has fielded former ULFA militant Suresh Bora who jumped ship from the Congress last year, when he was its Nagaon district president. The Congress won back the seat from the BJP after 20 years when Bordoloi won it in 2019 with a 49.53% vote share. That victory was facilitated by its alliance with Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF, which did not field a candidate in Nagaon in 2019. The AIUDF, which bagged around 25% of the vote share in both 2014 and 2009, has fielded its Dhing MLA Aminul Islam this year after the former allies had a fallout. Bengali-speaking Muslims also make up a decisive number of voters in other constituencies. At Karimganj in the Barak Valley, they are estimated to outnumber Hindu voters by around two lakh. And yet, Karimganj has never had a Muslim MP as it was reserved for SC candidates till the recent delimitation. Now that it is not reserved, the Congress has lined up Hafiz Rashid Ahmed Choudhury, while the AIUDF has fielded Sahabul Islam Choudhury, against the BJP’s sitting MP Kripanath Mallah. Bengali Muslims also make up a significant number of voters in Darrang-Udalguri, formerly the Mangaldoi constituency, and Silchar. In Silchar, a consolidation of the majority Bengali-Hindu vote and a ramshackle Opposition have made the BJP’s Parimal Suklabaidya the frontrunner. In Darrang-Udalguri, sitting BJP MP Dilip Saikia is being challenged by the Congress’s Madhab Rajbangshi and Durgadas Boro of the Bodoland People’s Front. In the autonomous district constituency of Diphu — a hilly, ST-reserved seat the BJP had won in 2019 — the party’s Amarsing Tisso is lined up against Joy Ram Engleng of the Congress, Jotson Bey of the Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC), and Jones Ingti Kathar of the APHPC. All candidates are promising to implement Article 244(A) for the creation of an “autonomous state” within Assam.

Though the dispute of the Shahi Idgah and the Krishna Janmasthan doesn’t find mention in the speeches of BJP leaders, locals are discussing the issue. However, this alone is unlikely to decide the vote for Hindus in Mathura, which goes to polls on Friday. While Hindutva is expected to play a role in the western UP constituency, the BJP’s two-term sitting MP and actor-turned-politician Hema Malini is facing a stiff challenge from her opponents, who are calling her “pravasi (outsider)” and “Bambai wali saansad (Mumbai’s MP)” while appealing to the voters to elect a local “brijwasi” this time. The BJP will be hoping to counter the anti-incumbency with its alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) drawing in the Jats. In Mathura, an estimated 45% of the constituency’s population is Jat. But a section of the community too favours local candidates, though according to Malini’s supporters, she is a “Jat bahu” – a reference to her husband and actor Dharmendra, who is a Jat. The BSP candidate Suresh Singh, who belongs to the Jat community, repeatedly reminded voters: “Dhyan rakhiye, apna hi kaam ayega (Keep in mind, only one of your own will help you).” Incidentally, before joining the BSP, Singh had been associated with the VHP. Congress candidate Mukesh Dhangar, who has the support of ally SP, has also attacked the BJP candidate along similar lines saying, “Nahi chahiye pravasi, abki baar brijwasi (We don’t want an outsider, elect a local this time)”. In bid to counter this narrative, Malini is circulating a four-page pamphlet, in which she refers to Mathura as her “karmabhoomi (place of work)”, highlighting the development work undertaken during her two tenures. The sitting MP has also floated the slogan “Viksit Mathura, Hema ki guarantee”, echoing the PM’s “Modi ki guarantee” slogan. Calling it “propaganda”, the BJP’s Mathura media in-charge Shyam Chaturvedi says Malini’s opponents were raising the “outsider” issue because there are no other issues over which to target the BJP. “Hema ji has been associated with Mathura for several decades. Also, since all the public representatives here are of the BJP, they address the public’s problems.” But not everyone in Mathura is convinced. “Malini has got development work done in Mathura, but these are major projects which she planned on her own. She never came to the villages to ask about local problems,” said Preetam Singh, a Jat in the constituency’s Hathoda village. He added that while Hindus want the Krishna Janmasthan to “get a grand shape like the Ram Mandir of Ayodhya”, he will not vote on the issue of temples. “The BJP raises such issues only to polarise voters. Temple will not feed my family. Inflation and unemployment are major problems.” Kishan Singh, a Jat from the same village who had voted for the BJP in 2014 and 2019, said he won’t vote for an “outsider” this time, “Why does the BJP not give opportunity to any local leader who could be available to us?” he said. But for Sulkhan Singh, another Jat from Hathoda, the BJP’s alliance with the RLD decided his vote for him. “Jahan Chaudhary ka parivar, wahan hum (I am always with the family of Chaudhary Charan Singh),” he said. In the Artauni village – which has a mixed population of Jats, Prajapatis (both OBCs) and Jatavs (Dalits) – Nek Shah, a Jat, is impressed with the global standing India achieved under Modi, but adds: “Where are the jobs? The government came with one recruitment scheme, Agniveer, which is useless.” At the Islamiya Market near Mathura’s Deeg Gate area, Kadir Qureshi, 52, who has been unemployed since the slaughter house he worked at shut down after the BJP came to power in UP in 2017, said: “Hindus – especially youths – proudly say the BJP government has oppressed Muslims.” On the ongoing Shahi Idgah dispute, Qureshi said, “Ram Mandir has already been built. Now they have entered Gyanvapi and started worship in a sealed cellar. They will do the same in Mathura too. Hindus will get this too if the BJP continues in power,” he said, adding he will vote for the candidate who put up a fight against the BJP. But among other voters, there is a desire to see a temple at the disputed site. Umesh Singh, a Thakur and businessman living nearby believes it is certain that if Modi gets a third term and the BJP comes to power in UP in 2027, a temple will be built at the Krishna Janmasthan. Bhoori Devi, 65, a street vendor near the premises of the Shahi Idgah, said, “I have been seeing a mosque since I came here from Rajasthan after marriage 40 years ago. I believe one day a grand temple will be built in Mathura.” In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Malini had defeated the RLD’s Kunwar Narendra Singh by 2.93 lakh votes. At the time, the RLD had an alliance with the SP and BSP. The Congress’s Mahesh Pathak had got only 28,084 votes. In the 2022 Assembly polls, when the RLD and SP were in an alliance, the BJP had won all the five Assembly segments in the Mathura Lok Sabha constituency. The BJP is confident of a 2019 repeat. “Mathura is a safe seat for the BJP. The RLD is also with us this time,” said Shyam Chaturvedi, the BJP’s Mathura media in-charge.       "," The construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya has instilled faith in the voters of Mathura that the BJP governments under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will see the dispute over the city’s Shahi Idgah mosque complex and the Krishna Janmasthan resolved in the courts, just as it has for the Ayodhya dispute.

The small-scale industries here have also got a lot of help from Mudra Yojana,” Modi said. In the narrow lanes of Aligarh where the lock industry and its ancillary units operate – “Yahan har ghar mein taala banta hai (Here every house makes locks)”, the saying goes – such promises are yet to trickle down. Anis Ahmad, one of the biggest lock manufacturers here, with a unit in Shah Jamal in Old Aligarh, overrun by overflowing drains, garbage heaps and hanging overhead electric wires, says MSMEs like theirs are lagging behind. “Government policies favour only big businesses.”  However, sitting in his office at his two-floor factory, as the sound of clanging machines trickles in, the 40-year-old adds that they don’t know much else to do. “Yeh hamare khoon mein hai (Lock-making is in our blood). Every generation passes on the knowledge to the next. However, most of those employed in it are not educated, and are unorganised and very poor; they know the technique of making locks, but they do not know how to market it or to get the benefits of government policies.” Ahmad says they are also worried about the administration’s plan to move the lock units to industrial areas like Tala Nagri, citing “violation” of norms. “How will a small unit buy land there?… Why uproots thousands of people? Yahan ek dusre ki chain fansi hui hai (People are dependent on each other here),” he says, while showing how “70 types of items” go into making a single padlock. Mohammad Azharuddin, who now runs his father’s electroplating business, which is an important component of lock manufacturing, says that while PM Modi to Opposition leaders mention Aligarh locks in their speech, the industry’s issues don’t figure among the concerns of any one. “We have no union, no leader. Jab hum doctor ko apni pareshani batayenge hi nahin, toh woh ilaaj kaise karega (If we are not able to tell a doctor our problem, how can he treat us)?” Azharuddin says, adding that Gujarat towns such as Rajkot and Jamnagar are now coming up as big players in the business, “only because they work together”. “I wonder if any person here has even heard that the lock industry is part of the Uttar Pradesh government’s ODOP scheme.” Azharuddin admits that a lot of hesitation towards the authorities is on account of the grey zone in which the units operate, but pointing to their rising input costs now, and adds: “If the government thinks of this work as heritage, they should give attention to the people involved in it.” Shubhamraj Varshney, who runs a lock shop in the Madar gate area of Aligarh, says the rising costs of inputs are hard to explain. “Some say it is due to the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Palestine wars. However I don’t think that is true. The raw materials do not come from these countries.” Birendra Kumar, Joint Commissioner of Industries, Aligarh, says the district has around 5,000 units registered under the ‘Locks and Ancillary’ category. “The yearly turnover is over Rs 10,000 crore. Around 1.5 lakh people are involved. The ODOP scheme consists of several components: finance, where a maximum subsidy of Rs 20 lakh is given for a loan of Rs 2 crore; a 10-day special training programme for artisans, with the provision of tool kits; and marketing development assistance to manufacturers, including subsidies to set up stalls at trade fairs and exhibitions,” says Kumar. Satish Gautam, the BJP’s two-time Aligarh MP, fielded again by the party, also talks about the ODOP scheme as the answer. Admitting that the woes of the industry were not a poll issue, Gautam refers to PM Modi’s speech to say it is very much on the BJP government’s mind. “Manufactures are already benefiting from the ODOP scheme, we will increase its coverage in the third term.” Gautam has won the last two times by margins of over two lakh votes. Facing him this time are the SP’s Bijendra Singh and the BSP’s Hitendra Upadhyay. In 2019, Gautam got 56.42% of the votes, with the BSP’s Ajeet Baliyan a distant second with 36.71%. The Congress got merely 4.37% votes.

Inside the chamber of the party’s district chief Rajendra Maske there, a smiling portrait of Maharashtra BJP stalwart late Gopinath Munde adorns a wall as people breeze in and out of the busy office. The Beed Lok Sabha constituency is witnessing a straight fight between BJP leader and ex-minister Pankaja Munde, daughter of Gopinath Munde, and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar)’s candidate Bajrang Sonwane. A prominent Vanjari (OBC) face, Pankaja had been estranged from the BJP for some time, but the party has now placated her by fielding her from her home turf. She has replaced her younger sister Pritam Munde, the two-time MP, who had joined politics after the death of their father in 2014. Interestingly, Pawar has again chosen to field Sonwane, a Maratha face, although he was defeated by Pritam in 2019 by 1.68 lakh votes. In the NCP(SP)’s Beed office, the makeover following the split in the party looks complete with its new name painted in bold along with the symbol of a “man blowing tutari (trumpet)”. Beed is one of the eight districts in the Marathwada region, which has been the epicentre of an intense agitation over the last several months for quotas for Marathas in jobs and education, which led to counter-protests by the OBCs. The ruling Mahayuti alliance comprising Chief Minister Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the BJP and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP finally passed a new law in the state legislature in February this year to extend 10% separate reservation to Marathas. It has been challenged in the Bombay High Court, where the matter has now been pending. Beed is among the most backward districts in Maharashtra, which provides almost 70% of farm labourers to economically prosperous sugar region of Western Maharashtra. The elections in Beed this time, many believe, may be influenced significantly by the Maratha quota issue, which has also snowballed into a conflict between Marathas and OBCs. The face of the Maratha quota stir, Manoj Jarange-Patil, who hails from Jalna in Marathwada, has rejected the Shinde government’s Maratha quota law, insisting that it must be provided under the OBC category. He has sought Kunbhi certificates for all Marathas to facilitate it. The long-standing standoff is said to have alienated a section of the Maratha community from the Mahayuti coalition while causing polarisation on the caste lines. After filing her nomination Wednesday, Pankaja expresses her disappointment. “In the Lok Sabha polls one expects discussion on national issues. I feel sad it’s not happening even in my constituency,” she says. Apart from Beed, the quota row has also gained traction in seven other constituencies in the drought-prone region, which include Aurangabad, Jalna, Hingoli, Nanded, Latur, Parbhani and Osmanabad. The slogan of “Ek Maratha lakh Maratha (one Maratha is equal to lakh Marathas)” has been raised with renewed aggression at rallies in rural Marathwada, which has been reeling under an agrarian crisis due to recurring unseasonal rains. In several OBC-dominated belts, the community activists have come up with their own counter-slogan, pointing out that their share in the state’s population is 50-52% as compared to Marathas’ 28-30%. While the Mahayuti camp believes that OBCs would rally behind them, the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP (SP) and Congress is looking to consolidate Marathas, Muslims and Dalits to expand their vote base. The Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA)’s president Prakash Ambedkar, who has also fielded some candidates in the region, said, “The polarisation in Marathwada is dangerous. The Maratha-OBC division has penetrated down to the mohalla level. This does not auger well for democracy.” If Jarange Patil has sought to connect with Marathas, especially the poor and lower middle class who are marginal farmers and farm labourers, NCP leader and minister Chaggan Bhujbal has positioned himself as a champion of the OBC cause. Bhujbal said, “I had to take a firm stand for OBCs after Maratha protesters torched the houses and commercial establishments of OBC people. Their demand for reservation within OBC quota cannot be accepted. The government has given them 10% separate reservation.” A businessman and OBC activist, Subash Raut, whose hotel in Beed was set on fire by a mob during the Maratha protests last year, laments, “During elections, parties often use caste as a strategy to consolidate their votes. But what we notice now is ugly casteism unleashed at unprecedented levels.” Many believe that the caste polarisation in the wake of the Maratha quota stir may result in turning this election as a neck-and-neck contest between the two alliances in the Marathwada region. Sayyed Arbaz, who runs a garage at Georai along the Beed highway, says, “In Marathwada, Gopinath Munde was an exception who broke the stereotypes and got Muslim votes despite being in BJP. Whether this will happen in current situation and to what extent I cannot hazard a guess. But personally, I believe there is goodwill about Munde family among Muslims.” In the 2019 polls, when the BJP contested in an alliance with the then undivided Shiv Sena, they had swept Marathwada. While the BJP won four seats – Beed, Jalna, Latur and Nanded – the Sena got three – Hingoli, Parbhani and Osmanabad – with the AIMIM picking the Aurangabad seat. Unlike 2019, the AIMIM and VBA are no longer allies this time. The Dalit factor may also play a significant role in determining the electoral outcome in the region, with the SC communities making up about 11% population of the state. The MVA is raking up their “threat to Constitution” charge to win over Dalits. A Parbhani resident Sandeep Ghade says, “With multiple parties and coalitions as well as the splits in Shiv Sena and NCP, people have lost faith in parties and leaders. In the absence of ideologies, caste politics seems to be an easy transition.” The Mahayuti is hoping PM Modi’s campaign would help them counter any public sympathy in favour of Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar over the splits in their respective parties. Hingoli, Parbhani and Nanded will go to polls in the second phase on April 26, Latur and Osmanabad on May 7, and Beed, Jalna and Aurangabad on May 13. In Parbhani, the Rashtriya Samaj Party’s Mahadev Jankar, a Mahayuti ally, is taking on the Sena (UBT)’s sitting MP Sanjay Jadhav. Hingoli is witnessing a battle between the Shiv Sena’s Baburao Kohalikar and the Sena (UBT)’s Nagesh Ashtikar. In the SC-reserved Latur, there is a straight fight between the BJP’s Sudhakar Shrungare and the Congress’s Shivaji Kalge. Osmanabad will see a face-off between the Sena (UBT)’s sitting MP Omraje Nimbalkar amd the NCP’s Archana Patil. The stage is set in Jalna for a fight between BJP MP and Union minister Raosaheb Danve and the Congress’s Kalyan Kale. In Aurangabad, the contest is triangular involving the AIMIM’s sitting MP Imtiaz Jaleel, Sandipan Bhumre (Shiv Sena) and Chandrakant Khaire (Sena-UBT).      "," The Beed Lok Sabha constituency is witnessing a straight fight between BJP leader and ex-minister Pankaja Munde, daughter of Gopinath Munde, and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar)’s candidate Bajrang Sonwane. In the NCP(SP)’s Beed office, the makeover following the split in the party looks complete with its new name painted in bold along with the symbol of a “man blowing tutari (trumpet)”. Beed is one of the eight districts in the Marathwada region, which has been the epicentre of an intense agitation over the last several months for quotas for Marathas in jobs and education, which led to counter-protests by the OBCs."
