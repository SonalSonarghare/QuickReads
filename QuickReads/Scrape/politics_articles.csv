500,‘Choosing the lesser evil’: Congress allies defend its Udhampur-Doda choice,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/choosing-lesser-evil-congress-allies-defend-udhampur-doda-choice-9264764/,"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/choudhary-lal-singh-pulse.jpg?resize=450,253","APRIL 12, 2024","In 2018, Choudhary Lal Singh had to step down as minister after he continued to publicly back the Kathua gang rape and murder accused; while NC is now even attending his rallies, PDP says it is 'not supporting Lal Singh, but idea of India'","WITH THE CONGRESS having fielded the controversial Choudhary Lal Singh, who had publicly supported the accused in the 2018 gang rape and murder of a minor Bakerwal girl in Kathua, from Udhampur-Doda, its allies have been forced to go back on their criticism of him. The Congress, which had demanded stern action against the Kathua accused at the time, reinducted Lal Singh into its fold last month before giving him a ticket from Udhampur, a seat Lal Singh has won in the past. The party apparently wavered over the issue, finally giving in as it could not find any other winnable candidate. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), whose president Mehbooba Mufti as the chief minister in 2018 had got her then ally BJP to drop Lal Singh from her Cabinet over his stance in the case, is campaigning for him now. The same goes for the National Conference (NC), whose leader Omar Abdullah only last year opposed Lal Singh’s bid to join Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra in its J&K leg, warning the Congress that some people might try to use the Yatra to “whitewash their past”. “We have not forgotten the role played by those leaders who tried to save the (Kathua) rapists,’’ Omar had then told reporters. Asked about the Congress fielding Lal Singh now, NC spokesperson Imran Dar said, “It is the Congress’s decision… Our stand is very clear. Like the Congress cannot dictate to us whom to field, we cannot question their candidate selection.’’ Dar added: “There are two evils and we have to choose the lesser evil for a bigger fight now. At present, we have to defeat the BJP.” PDP spokesperson Firdous Tak also argued the same: “We have to see a larger and a broader objective at the moment… We are not supporting Lal Singh, but the idea of India, which we believe is the core ideology of the Congress and INDIA bloc.’’ However, while senior NC leaders, including ex-ministers, have been sharing the dais with Lal Singh, their PDP counterparts are staying away. “Only our junior leaders and ground-level workers are attending Lal Singh’s rallies,’’ a senior PDP leader said, admitting that the party is uncomfortable about “supporting the very person whom it had ousted from the Cabinet”. He added: “Mehbooba Mufti has made it clear to the Congress high command that she will not share the stage, or seek votes for him directly during the elections.” Asked about the Congress fielding a man whom the party had once criticised, J&K Congress chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma argued back: “It is for the BJP to clarify, as he (Lal Singh) along with one of its other ministers, Chander Parkash Ganga, went there (to the rally held by the kin of the accused) on its instructions.” Sharma added: “Our stand was very clear. We wanted justice for the victim, and we did not politicise the issue… When the BJP found itself trapped in the matter, it sacrificed him (Lal Singh) to save its coalition government.” Deepika Pushkar Nath, who had quit the Congress over its invite to Lal Singh to join Rahul’s Yatra, and who represented the Kathua victim as an advocate, accused J&K leaders of hypocrisy and double-standards. The Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP) of Ghulam Nabi Azad-led also criticised the Congress move as reflective of its “hypocrisy and fear of losing elections”. Its spokesperson Salman Nizami said Omar too was “betraying frustration in view of the NC’s shrinking base”. “The DPAP was the first to name G M Saroori as its Udhampur nominee soon after the BJP announced the candidature of (Union Minister of State) Jitendra Singh,” Nizami said, arguing that the “DPAP is the only party fighting the BJP in J&K”. “The NC and PDP have joined hands with the Congress only to weaken and target Azad,” he said. Jitendra Singh has won the past two times from Udhampur. Originally belonging to the Congress, Lal Singh had defected to the BJP ahead of the 2014 Assembly polls and, on winning, was inducted as a minister in the PDP-BJP coalition government. He had to step down after publicly supporting the Kathua accused. Lal Singh had gone on to hold ‘Tiranga’ rallies attacking “Kashmiri politicians” including Mehbooba, accusing them of using the Crime Branch to “frame” the accused as part of “a conspiracy against Jammu”. He had also quit the BJP to set up a Dogra Swabhiman Sangathan, alleging discrimination against Dogras and advocating a separate Jammu state. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Lal Singh had contested simultaneously from Jammu and Udhampur, but got less than 20,000 votes in each, losing his security deposit. Even the voters in the panchyat to which the accused belong did not support Lal Singh.    "," The same goes for the National Conference (NC), whose leader Omar Abdullah only last year opposed Lal Singh’s bid to join Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra in its J&K leg, warning the Congress that some people might try to use the Yatra to “whitewash their past”. At present, we have to defeat the BJP.” PDP spokesperson Firdous Tak also argued the same: “We have to see a larger and a broader objective at the moment… We are not supporting Lal Singh, but the idea of India, which we believe is the core ideology of the Congress and INDIA bloc.’’ However, while senior NC leaders, including ex-ministers, have been sharing the dais with Lal Singh, their PDP counterparts are staying away."
501,"In seat facing Lanka, highlight is OPS’s fight, not Sethusamudram or Katchatheevu",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/ops-sri-lanka-sethusamudram-kathcatheevu-9264645/,"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/ops.jpg?resize=450,253","APRIL 12, 2024","The former CM expelled from AIADMK and now in BJP camp is fighting from a relatively new territory, facing lingering anger over his “rebellion”","LOCATED deep in southern Tamil Nadu, a state where it is just beginning to make an impact, Ramanathapuram has long been on the BJP’s radar. Under the UPA government at the Centre, it waged a battle against the Sethusamudram project to create a shipping route between India and Sri Lanka, whose one end would have touched Ramanathapuram, claiming it would destroy the bridge Lord Ram’s army made as per the Ramayana. Last year, a buzz began that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose government has been making extensive outreach to Tamils, would contest from Ramanathapuram. Once the Lok Sabha poll battle began, the BJP rolled out yet another dice – accusing the Indira Gandhi-led Congress government of giving away Katchatheevu island located 33 km off the Ramanathapuram coast, and the ruling DMK (which was also in power in the state then) of being complicit in the decision. In the Ramanathapuram constituency itself, which directly faces Sri Lanka, none of the above is an issue, despite it being a fishermen constituency. The most distinctive feature of the fight here is the candidature of O Panneerselvam or OPS, the man who has become the face of the transformation the AIADMK has undergone since J Jayalalithaa’s demise in December 2016, much of it seen as wrought by the BJP. Having lost successive battles for control of the AIADMK – at party fora, and in courts – OPS has been forced to take shelter in the BJP-led alliance, after the AIADMK parted ways with it. The ex-CM is now contesting as an Independent, with BJP support. Now making perhaps his last stand, in a seat that was won in 2019 by DMK ally IUML, and where the party remains strong, the 73-year-old is campaigning late into the evening, trying to cover as much ground as he can. Close to midnight on Tuesday, driving down in a convoy from a campaign meeting at a small village near Ramanathapuram town, OPS remains unflagging – at least in his desire to wrest back the AIADMK. No, there is no regret about rebelling against the official faction led by E Palaniswami. Or any desire to “time travel” and change the sequence of events leading to his expulsion from the party, in which he had spent more than 45 years. “Why should I want to time travel?” OPS retorts. “All my steps were to retrieve the party from certain people, and hand it to ordinary AIADMK cadres.” It is hard not to take OPS’s words with a pinch of salt. “The certain people” he talks about are Jayalalithaa’s confidante V K Sasikala and her nephew T T V Dhinakaran – now also expelled from the AIADMK and part of the BJP camp, like OPS. OPS, in fact, has agreed to let Dhinakaran contest the Theni seat, which had been won by OPS’s son O P Ravindranath Kumar in 2019 (the only constituency not won by the DMK-led alliance then). Ravindranath is now actively working for Dhinakaran in Theni, OPS’s native town. On the other hand, Ramanathapuram, from where OPS is contesting, is relatively new ground for him. He has taken on the risk despite already being a sitting MLA. Aides say the BJP kept him waiting till the last minute on assurance of support, as it probed the scope of a patch-up with the AIADMK. OPS’s biggest hope is that the Thevars, the OBC community to which he belongs and which is dominant here, will stand by him. The DMK alliance has refielded the IUML’s 2019 winner, K Navas Kani. The AIADMK’s P Jeyaperumal and Naam Tamilar Katchi’s Chandraprabha are also in the fray. Denying reports that he was forced to give up Theni, OPS says it was he who picked Ramanathapuram “because it is the place where Lord Ram built the bridge across the ocean to rescue Sita Devi”. The fact that the BJP has been making slow gains here would have been another factor. If in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, it got 16.5% of the votes, by 2014, it was up to 17.20%. In 2019, the BJP-AIADMK together got 32.31% votes. While the winner in 2014 was the AIADMK, with 40.81% of the votes, and the runner-up the DMK with 28.81% votes, in 2019, DMK ally IUML got 44.29% of the votes and the AIADMK-BJP alliance was second placed. The IUML 2019 win was not a fluke given Ramanathapuram’s significant minority population, another reason that the BJP has treaded here on the back of allies. This time, if the DMK has the IUML with it, the AIADMK has the PFI political wing SDPI (Social Democratic Party of India) as an ally. OPS says he is confident that Muslims too would vote for him seeing the Modi government’s record. “No minority community has been targeted under Modi. Everyone is treated equally,” he says. While OPS admits he hasn’t had any detailed interaction with Modi since the poll dates were announced, he claims “respect” for him since 2016. “Everyone respects him, and it is certain that he will be elected for a third time.” Returning to Palaniswami and why he thinks the AIADMK is no longer the party it was, OPS says: “When MGR started the party, it had bylaws, and the most important was the direct election of the party general secretary by the crores of cadres. That has been sabotaged by Palaniswami.” He denies that his description of Palaniswami as “dictatorial, undemocratic” has long held true for the AIADMK. “Amma (Jayalalithaa) was very democratic. Everything she did was in consultation with people like me, officers and experts… not like Palaniswami,” OPS says. However, not all believe OPS’s portrayal of himself as a victim of the internecine AIADMK fight. Many see him as the man who betrayed the AIADMK soon after Jayalalithaa’s demise, particularly as he was officiating as the CM at the time on her behalf (as he had done earlier as well). Within the BJP alliance too, some are not happy with the ticket to him and, on condition of anonymity, admit to working to defeat him. “OPS was the man who triggered a revolt within the AIADMK without leaving the party. The people don’t accept this, even if they forgive leaders jumping ship,” says a Madurai-based leader of the Tamil Maanila Congress, which is also a part of the NDA. This is why other AIADMK rebels such as Dhinakaran (Theni) and Nainar Nagendran (Tirunelveli) are viewed more favourably. Many point out that while Nagendran quit the AIADMK back in 2017, Dhinakaran had fought a long and hard battle against the BJP. It has been difficult for OPS to shake off the impression that he acted as an RSS stooge in fomenting rebellion within the AIADMK. In 2019, senior RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy claimed at the golden jubilee function of the Tughlak magazine that it was on his advice that OPS had rebelled against Sasikala, who saw herself as the natural successor to Jayalalithaa.    "," Once the Lok Sabha poll battle began, the BJP rolled out yet another dice – accusing the Indira Gandhi-led Congress government of giving away Katchatheevu island located 33 km off the Ramanathapuram coast, and the ruling DMK (which was also in power in the state then) of being complicit in the decision.

It is also hoping to better its 2019 performance, when the party won just 2 of the 11 seats in the state. One of those two seats was Bastar, from where the Congress has fielded its six-term MLA Kawasi Lakhma this time, and which votes on April 19. He speaks to The Indian Express on the upcoming election, the poll issues, and rights of tribals, among other things. Firstly, there is no railway line connecting Bastar with Raipur. There should be two – one connecting the seven districts which the Lok Sabha seat covers, and another connecting it with Bhadrachalam and Warangal in neighbouring Telangana. I want Bastar to be connected with all major cities in India. On the lines of Ayodhya, we need an airport in Dantewada so that people can come here in huge numbers to visit the Danteshwari temple. The second issue is Naxalism. Be it at the hands of the police or Naxals, tribals are being killed. Young tribals are sent to jail or migrate. I tried to solve the issue when we were in power and succeeded. The (Bhupesh) Baghel government worked on the principle of ‘vishwas, vikas and suraksha (trust, development and security)’, but since the BJP has come to power, they have started killing and sending tribals to jail again… sai sai (quickly, a play on the name of BJP CM Vishnu Deo Sai). Tribals are being threatened. Since they are less educated, they are being beaten and threatened… We need to bring them into the mainstream. When we were in power, except the Silger incident, where three tribals were killed, no other incident occurred. There have been 10 incidents of police firing since the BJP took over four months ago. Today, even ordinary tribals going to the market or fairs are seen as Naxals by the government. I will fight this issue in Delhi and bring peace to Bastar. Tribals need to get land rights, food and water. The third issue is reduction of the height of the Polavaram dam on the Godavari river. This must be done to ensure villages in Chhattisgarh are not inundated and villagers are not displaced. We formulated the PESA, but after assuming power, the BJP is suppressing it and stealing the rights of tribals. We need it to save the Bailadila range and Nagarnar Steel Plant from Adani (Group). I have spoken about these issues in my 25-year career in Chhattisgarh and now I will take them to Delhi. In fact, I will also get a lead in Chote Amabal, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held rallies… The biggest fraud in the world today is electoral bonds… You have sent (former Jharkhand CM) Hemant Soren and (Delhi CM) Arvind Kejriwal to jail, but who will be sent to jail for this? When I was the state industries minister, I floated a proposal that the Chhattisgarh government will run the plant if the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) cannot. I will fight till my last breath to ensure it is not privatised. I am 101% sure I will win… The BJP is saying it (the NDA) will win 400 Lok Sabha seats but I am not sure they will cross even 200. The Congress-led INDIA bloc will win and Rahul Gandhi will become the PM. This time, even the RSS is not with Modi, so how do you expect the country to support him? The STs and SCs are united this time and know neither the BSP or CPI will win. I am the BJP’s only competitor. People know I am a six-time MLA and former minister, and can raise their voice in Delhi. The BJP thinks it can get votes by using a car and a speaker but I am entering the hearts of people. We have worked for all communities. I come from a humble background and have worked my way up, hence people do not call me neta (leader), I am popular as ‘dadi (brother)’. Who knows the BJP’s candidate (Mahesh Kashyap)? The BJP gets votes only due to Modi, and this time there is no Modi wave. Look at him… he looks upset. He guaranteed Rs 15 lakh to each person but did not give even 15 paise. What guarantee is he talking about? Kashyap is the one making an issue out of it. The issues I mentioned earlier are the real ones. In India, we believe in all religions.

503,"As Gandhis stall on Amethi, Raebareli, voters warn: ‘Those times are gone when you could wave, win’",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/gandhis-stall-amethi-raebareli-voters-warn-times-change-9264309/,"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/congress-amethi-1600.jpeg?resize=450,253","APRIL 12, 2024","As BJP's newly built offices buzz, Congress is struggling to keep up momentum, with coordination with SP still to take off","It is a Sunday afternoon. Sitting with two colleagues and scrolling through his social media feed, Amethi district Congress president Pradeep Singhal says he is confident Rahul Gandhi will again contest from the seat. And, five years after he lost the family seat to the BJP’s Smriti Irani, Singhal says: “He will win.” Barring the three, the district Congress committee office – more like a re-fashioned shop space – at Gauriganj in Amethi is empty. There is a larger central Congress office next to it, but it is deserted, just over a month before Amethi votes in the fifth phase, May 20. Singhal suddenly stops his social media scrolling as he chances upon the “massive turnout” for the nomination filing by a candidate in Banswara in Rajasthan. “Look at the crowd!” he exclaims. “He (the candidate) is on a camel.” His colleague Sarvesh Kumar Singh hesitatingly points out that the candidate Singhal mistook for the Congress nominee belongs to “some Adivasi party” (the Bharat Adivasi Party’s Rajkumar Roat). The two reluctantly return to the Amethi campaign. To questions as to why Rahul has not been declared the candidate yet, Singh says the announcement will come as soon as voting in Wayanad – the constituency in Kerala from where the Congress leader won in 2019 and is re-contesting – is over on April 26. But it is just a speculation, with no official reason on offer for the delay; the filing of nominations begins in a fortnight. Contrary to the listless Congress office, the BJP’s located a few kilometres away is buzzing – the party has built new structures in both Amethi and Raebareli. Irani, who has been re-fielded by the BJP, is scheduled to arrive the next day, her second visit to the constituency since the announcement of the election schedule. BJP district president Ram Prasad Mishra lists Irani’s “achievements” – the Amethi bypass project; a medical college in Tiloi; a trauma centre in Jagdishpur; a Coca-Cola subsidiary’s bottling plant. Above all, Mishra says, Irani is now “a resident of Amethi”. In February, she performed a house-warming ceremony for the house she has bought in Gauriganj. The BJP is underlining this, as well as the fact that Irani is also a voter from Amethi now – contrasting this to Rahul, who is contesting again from Wayanad. 2024 vs 2019 The 2024 battle in many ways has an echo of 2019. The Congress’s main pitch is still the Gandhi family and its “contributions” to Amethi, such as the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi, Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, and the Footwear Design and Development Institute. The BJP, in turn, blames them for the region’s “pre-2019” backwardness despite the seat’s VIP tag. Rahul won the seat thrice between 2004 and 2014, and before that it was held by Sonia Gandhi. Even Congress sympathisers say Rahul paid the price for not visiting Amethi enough, and then opting to contest from a second seat. There has been no visible course-correction, with Rahul visiting Amethi just four times in the last five years – in December 2021 and February 2022 to campaign for the 2022 Assembly elections, and in February this year, when his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra passed through the constituency and Raebareli. The 2022 Assembly results did not augur well for the Congress either. Of the five segments in Amethi, three were won by the BJP and two by the Samajwadi Party. Both the SP MLAs – Rakesh Pratap Singh (Gauriganj) and Maharaji Prajapati (Amethi) – are now in the BJP. The SP and Congress are allies this time, though as per SP leaders’ own admission, they have not held any coordination meetings so far. SP district president Ram Udit Yadav says their own preparations are on track. “We have been holding meetings from the booth to the district level.” On the SP leaders who joined the BJP, Yadav says: “The party has not suffered one bit, only emerged stronger.” A shopkeeper in Gauriganj, who remains a loyal Rahul voter, admits the Congress leader continues to let Amethi drift away. “Even if he doesn’t do much… an MP should be in the constituency often.” Another leader says: “Rahul, or for that matter any leader, can’t just file his nomination, wave at the people and vanish. Woh zamana chala gaya (Those times are gone).” The other seat In Raebareli, the BJP and Congress are almost in the same boat, waiting for their candidates. The stock reply of supporters is: “Let the candidates be announced. Phir pata chalega kaisi takkar hoti hai (Then we will know what kind of a fight it is).” However, unlike Amethi, there is a semblance of action at Tilak Bhawan, the Congress office in Raebareli, even at 7 pm on a Saturday – uncommon for the laid-back party. Sonia, who won the seat in 2019, has bowed out of the electoral race, and the buzz is that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will make her electoral debut from Raebareli. While the Congress is yet to reveal its cards, a section of the BJP is apprehensive about the names that might fall out when the party opens its own. Two of those in contention are Dinesh Pratap Singh, a minister in the Uttar Pradesh government, who was the BJP’s candidate in 2019 and lost to Sonia by over 1.67 lakh votes; and Manoj Pandey, who recently crossed over from the SP. A section of the party believes only a candidate from “outside” – like Irani in Amethi — stands a chance against Priyanka. “The party will not be completely united if Singh or Pandey contests,” a leader says. Pandey’s exit though is set to hurt the SP-Congress alliance. In the 2022 Assembly elections, the SP had won all but one of the five Assembly segments falling under the Raebareli Lok Sabha seat, with the Congress drawing a blank. The only seat won by the BJP was the Raebareli Assembly segment. Here again, while the SP is confident of transferring its votes to the Congress, there have been no coordination meetings. “Akhilesh (Yadav) ji had a meeting and we were clearly told to ensure proper coordination with the Congress,” says Raebareli SP district president Virendra Yadav. At the Congress office, as a group of old-timers discuss politics, the talk veers around to Priyanka’s husband Robert Vadra, who has been making noises about wanting to contest. They rule out the possibility, asserting the candidate will be Priyanka. In his room, Congress city president Dheeraj Srivastava and a colleague are supervising feeding of data in a computer on booth agents. Asked whether he has been sounded out by the Congress regarding Priyanka, Srivastava says: “Bataya nahin gaya hai… par vishwas hai woh aayengi (We have not been told, but we are confident she will make her debut).” Compared to the faded Congress office, the BJP’s is in a newly built multi-storey building, a few kilometers away. And the keyboards are clicking fast here as well. Local BJP leader Pushpendra Singh is working out a schedule for mandal-level “nukkad sabhas (corner meetings)”, starting from Friday. Unlike in Amethi, where even Congress sympathisers struggle with Rahul’s “absence”, in Raebareli, voters say they understand, citing sitting MP Sonia’s fragile health. Since winning in 2019, her fourth victory in a row from Raebareli, Sonia has visited only once – a month after the results. The issues Both in Amethi and Raebareli, issues like the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, the Opposition’s demand for a caste census or, for that matter, Rahul’s Yatra that crossed the region just two months ago are not top of mind. More common is the mention of “the use of ED and CBI” by the Modi government, though sarcastically in the context of leaders switching sides What comes up most often is the Centre’s popular free ration scheme. Is unemployment, one of the Congress’s main poll issues and part of its manifesto, a concern? For some it is. Standing outside a coaching institute with his friends, Satyendra Lodh, 18, elaborates the problem with asking the BJP questions. “BJP hamesha palatwar karti hai… Paani bharna hai toh balti leke kuen ke paas hi jayenge na? Kuan thodi na bolta hai taalab mein pani nahin hai. Sawal toh sarkar se hi poocha jata hai (The BJP is always ready with a counter. If one needs water, one will go to the well, isn’t it? The well can’t say, ‘But the pond has no water’. Questions can only be asked of the government).”    "," Sitting with two colleagues and scrolling through his social media feed, Amethi district Congress president Pradeep Singhal says he is confident Rahul Gandhi will again contest from the seat. And, five years after he lost the family seat to the BJP’s Smriti Irani, Singhal says: “He will win.” Barring the three, the district Congress committee office – more like a re-fashioned shop space – at Gauriganj in Amethi is empty. To questions as to why Rahul has not been declared the candidate yet, Singh says the announcement will come as soon as voting in Wayanad – the constituency in Kerala from where the Congress leader won in 2019 and is re-contesting – is over on April 26."
504,"In recent BJP turf Cooch Behar in Bengal, it’s Modi’s schemes vs Mamata’s",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bengal-lok-sabha-elections-cooch-behar-mamata-modi-9263710/,"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/cooch-behar.jpg?resize=450,253","APRIL 11, 2024","Sitting MP Nisith Pramanik constantly brings up Sandeshkhali, also appeals to Muslims; TMC's Jagadish Chandra Burma Basunia harks to steps taken by Mamata govt for Rajbongshis","There is a distinct similarity in the pitches of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BJP as they campaign in North Bengal for the Lok Sabha elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee made their stump speeches on April 4  and set the tone for the local representatives of the two parties as they make their final push in the three constituencies in the Dooars — Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar — which vote on April 19. The Cooch Behar fight is essentially between sitting BJP MP Nishith Pramanik and the TMC’s Jagadish Chandra Burma Basunia — who lost from Sitai in the 2021 Assembly polls. Nitish Chandra Roy of the Forward Bloc (FB) is also in the race, in a “friendly fight” with ally Congress’s Pia Roy Chowdhury. Barring Chowdhury, all three others are Rajbongshis. Since at least 2019, the BJP has held the upper hand in this region, and especially in this seat. That year, Pramanik won by over 50,000 votes. In the 2021 Assembly polls, the BJP won all the seven Assembly segments under the Cooch Behar Lok Sabha constituency. Basunia — whom Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee described as “our diamond candidate” at her April 4 public meeting — is banking on the promise of a hike in the CM’s direct benefit schemes like Lakshmir Bhandar. At around 2.30 pm on a Tuesday, the TMC’s Basunia, braving the blazing sun, tells the crowd gathered at the chaupal (community space) of Kalitala-Nayarhat village: “Do you want your Lakshmir Bhandar benefit to double from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 (per month)?” The response is an emphatic “Yes.” Pramanik is reaching out to all, including Muslims, highlighting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development pitch and the recent series of incidents in Sandeshkhali. Addressing a meeting of around 200 people that same night, at a market in Kaljani in rural Cooch Behar, which is lit up compared to its surroundings, Pramanik, who happens to be the youngest minister in the Modi government, roars into a mic: “Modiji’s central schemes are for everyone — both Hindus and Muslims. Do you want a Sandeshkhali here?” The crowd responds, “No.” Pramanik’s campaign has been marked by small street-corner meetings with a convoy of cars, mobikes and an open-top jeep; Basunia has been holding meetings in villages accompanied by party workers and leaders. At Kaljani village, which has a significant Muslim population, Pramanik’s message is the same: “Modiji’s schemes — PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, PM Vishwakarma can be availed by all, Hindus or Muslims. We do not differentiate… I may be the candidate, but it is not about ‘I’. It’s about ‘we’. Let’s all strengthen Modiji’s hand, make India the world’s best nation.” He also steers to Sandeshkhali, asking the crowd whether they know about “the atrocities the TMC did on women there”. At Nilkuthi Bazar, he arrives as the Forward Bloc’s Roy is holding a rally. As Pramanik says he will wait for Roy to finish — “In a democracy, all political parties have the right to speak” — the crowd cheers. In his speeches, Basunia mentions the recent poll losses in Cooch Behar. At Kalitala-Nayarhat under Mathabhanga-II block, he admits the setbacks and adds: “This is the time to turn around… You all know and receive benefits of Mamata Banerjee’s schemes like Kanyashree and Lakshmir Bhandar… It is only Mamata Banerjee who has brought so many government schemes for you. Modi won’t do it.” In a rhetoric quite similar to Pramanik’s, Basunia adds: “We may be the candidates, but Didi (Mamata) is above us all. Vote for Didi.” Speaking to The Indian Express, Basunia says: “Last time, the Rajbongshis were with them (the BJP). This time, the community is with us. They have realised they will get nothing from the BJP or the Centre. At the PM’s April 4 address in Cooch Behar, there were no yellow Rajbongshi flags, unlike 2019. It is Mamata Banerjee who gave recognition to the Rajbongshi language, set up the Narayani battalion of the State Police for them, and erected statues of Rajbanshi icons (Panchanan Barma and Chila Ray).” On Sandeshkhali, Basunia says: “The culprits have been arrested by the state police. But what about the Manipur situation? What did the BJP and the Centre do?”    "," Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee made their stump speeches on April 4  and set the tone for the local representatives of the two parties as they make their final push in the three constituencies in the Dooars — Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar — which vote on April 19. Nitish Chandra Roy of the Forward Bloc (FB) is also in the race, in a “friendly fight” with ally Congress’s Pia Roy Chowdhury. Basunia — whom Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee described as “our diamond candidate” at her April 4 public meeting — is banking on the promise of a hike in the CM’s direct benefit schemes like Lakshmir Bhandar."

He will first visit Mandla in Madhya Pradesh to perform a puja at the Maa Narmada Pujon Rapta ghat. After that, he will address a rally at the local police ground. Mandla will vote in Phase 1 of the Lok Sabha elections, scheduled for April 19, and the BJP’s Faggan Singh Kulaste will take on the Congress’ Omkar Singh Markaam here. In the afternoon, he will travel to Katni in Madhya Pradesh where he will go to the Vijaynath Dham mandir in the town. Katni falls under the Khajuraho Lok Sabha constituency from where the BJP’s VD Sharma is again contesting. The BJP had won 28 of the 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh last time, and it will be seen if it can manage to retain the tally in a state that falls into the Hindi heartland grouping that the BJP almost swept last time. Shah will also travel to Maharashtra, which has all the indications of being a neck-and-neck fight so far, with both the Maha Vikas Aghadi (Shiv Sena (UBT), Congress, NCP(Sharadchandra Pawar) as well as the ruling NDA (BJP, Shiv Sena NCP) vowing to go all out. The coming election is also the first major electoral contest after the respective splits in the Sena and the NCP. Shah will address a gathering in Nanded, his first election rally in Maharashtra. Nanded will vote in the second phase scheduled for April 26. Here, the BJP has fielded sitting MP Prataprao Chikhlikar as its candidate, while the Congress party’s former MLA Vasantrao Yashwant is in the fray. The Nanded Lok Sabha seat is among the eight constituencies in Marathwada region — a region that has remained a challenge for the BJP. Despite many efforts, the BJP has not been able to make deep inroads in Nanded. Even during the Narendra Modi wave in 2014, Ashok Chavan had defeated BJP candidate Digambar Patil. But this time, the BJP hopes to reverse the trend. In February, the BJP got Congress leader and former chief minister Ashok Chavan to join the party. This was a huge setback to the Congress with Chavan having a huge base in Marathwada. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Chavan, who had then contested as Congress candidate, was defeated by BJP’s Prataprao Chikhlikar. The BJP is also taking heart from the loss of the Congress hold in the region, which is now limited to the districts of Latur and Nanded. In 2019, out of the eight seats, the Shiv Sena won three while the BJP won four. The AIMIM was a surprise winner in the lone seat of Chhatrapati Samabhajinagar. In a changed political scenario after the split in the Shiv Sena, the task in front of Shiv Sena *UBT)’s Uddhav Thackeray will be to retain his dominance. Meanwhile, Raj Thakeray, the president of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) is set to canvas in support of the NDA. Sanjay Shirsat, the spokesperson for the Shiv Sena made the announcement on Wednesday. “There was a possibility of vote division which could have resulted in us (NDA alliance) slightly missing our target to win 45 plus seats in Maharashtra. Now, we will definitely achieve our target,” Shirsat told reporters. All of the 39 seats in Tamil Nadu head for polls in the first phase, which is just a week away from now. The state will be closely watched in the days to come for the discourse shaping up. The ruling DMK and its allies had won 38 of the 39 seats in the 2019 polls and this time, the BJP hopes to make a breakthrough in the state. P Vaidyanathan Iyer writes that the BJP is hoping to cement caste identity – by reaching out to OBC groups such as the Vanniyars — alongside religious identity in the state. Whether that will pay off in Tamil Nadu, where the DMK is a formidable challenge and the BJP has never historically had a presence, remains unclear at the moment.

The BJP’s Bishnu Pada Ray is in the fray and will fight incumbent Congress MP Kuldeep Rai Sharma. Ray and Sharma have long been rivals in the seat. Ray was first elected to the Lok Sabha from the constituency in 1999 when he defeated Sharma. He again won in 2009 and 2014.

But today, I say with much regret, that politics did not change but political leaders did,” Anand, who came under the Enforcement Directorate (ED) scanner last November, said after resigning from the party alleging corruption. From working as a child labourer in a padlock factory Anand went on to become one of the top rexine leather manufacturers in north India. According to party insiders, he was initially not as interested in politics as his wife Veena who contested on an AAP ticket in the 2013 Delhi Assembly polls from Patel Nagar and won. Two years later, when Veena was denied a ticket, a rift occurred between Anand and the party. She contested from Patel Nagar on a Swaraj Party ticket but lost to the AAP. “Anand is a businessman and has never been a ground worker or had keen interests like other politicians,” said a senior AAP leader. “But his wife was more interested and associated with the party than him but he always wanted to become MLA … when the rift mended and he came in contact with CM Arvind Kejriwal, he was given a ticket from Patel Nagar and won (in 2020).” Apart from the rexine business, Anand has also had business interests in the real estate sector. In the 2020 poll affidavit, he declared assets worth Rs 78.9 crore. Before joining the AAP, he used to run the Anand Path Foundation for underprivileged children. As part of this foundation, he also ran an “Ambedkar Pathshala”, according to those who know him. After Rajendra Pal Gautam resigned from the Delhi government in October 2022 amid a political storm over his involvement in a religious conversion event, Anand replaced him. Last November, the ED conducted searches at places, including Anand’s premises, alleging that evidence of unaccounted business investments and hawala payments sent to China in 2023 were recovered from some of his key employees. About Anand’s resignation, an AAP insider said, “He got scared very much and was in trouble after the ED’s raid at his house … He even discussed with some of the party leaders about this and how he was getting calls …He even lost 7-8 kgs and was sick for some time.” Adding that Anand’s resignation had created a tense situation in the party, the leader said, “His case is also different, so not many know what the exact case is … One of his close family members said they came in contact with some senior BJP leader last week.”    "," Delhi Cabinet Minister Raaj Kumar Anand whose resignation from the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) primary membership on Wednesday stumped his colleagues has been an associate of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal since the days of the “India Against Corruption” movement. “I was feeling suffocated for some time … till yesterday, it felt as if we (the AAP) were being falsely implicated but the (Delhi) High Court’s decision yesterday made me realise that there was certainly something wrong somewhere … I entered politics when Arvind Kejriwal ji said that if its politics changes, the country will change.

Whether the outreach to the middle castes will help BJP, or be counter-productive given the distinct social reform movement in Tamil Nadu, is a difficult question to answer.","Jothi Pandian and Shiva Kumar, two young men who run a small office a couple of kilometres from the Saint Gobain glass factory, off the Chennai-Sriperumbudur highway, couldn’t agree if sitting Lok Sabha MP and DMK candidate DM Kathir Anand would retain his seat in Vellore, a neighbouring constituency. Kathir Anand, 49, is the son of Tamil Nadu Water Resources Minister Durai Murugan, a DMK veteran, who entered the state Assembly in 1971, and is a 10-time MLA. But this time, Kathir faces a tough battle and there are many factors at play – a big one being Prime Minister Narendra Modi and how his combative nominee and state BJP president K Annamalai has changed the party’s image in the state. The BJP and its pronounced presence in the state is not lost on Jothi Pandian. “We are Vanniyars and our vote is for the Pattali Makkal Katchi (symbol: mango), which has tied up with BJP… What I personally believe is for us Vanniyars to prosper, Hindu religion has to survive and thrive,” he says, placing his community in the rubric of religion. It is not the first time that the S Ramadoss-led PMK, which represents the Vanniyars and demands reservation for them, has allied with the BJP; in the 2019 Lok Sabha and 2021 Assembly elections too, it was in an AIADMK-led alliance with the BJP. Vanniyars have a significant presence in north Tamil Nadu in parliamentary constituencies such as Vellore, Arakkonam, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri and Tiruvannamalai. Jothi Pandian’s understanding of society structures, and his locating of the Vanniyar caste within the Hindu fold may appear quite simple at one level. But such social engineering that BJP is seen to be attempting in Tamil Nadu, the last frontier for the party which is perceived by many in the state as anti-Tamil and anti-minorities, requires remarkable understanding of the Tamil culture, society and history. The cementing of caste identity with religious identity and riding two horses at the same time is viewed as a key BJP strategy in Tamil Nadu. Not doing so risks the BJP being captive to its image of being a ‘pro-Brahmin’, upper caste-dominated party. But whether this outreach to the middle castes will help it, or be counter-productive given the distinct social reform movement in the state, is a difficult question to answer. The BJP has been trying to find space in Tamil Nadu ever since the demise of AIADMK’s star leader J Jayalalitha, who eventually inherited the political legacy of MG Ramachandran. Indeed, none of the Dravidian parties have in the past offered support to the BJP’s core Hindutva ideology – it was always tactical, says Ramu Manivannan, an academician, who has worked in Delhi University for almost 15 years, and was head of the department of politics in Madras University. “The decline of Congress over the last decade, transition in political leadership in Dravidian parties here – BJP foresaw all this. It systematically started preparing for many years now,” he said. In the absence of an alliance with AIADMK, the three-way split in the MGR-founded party – Edappadi Palaniswami, O Panneerselvam and TTV Dhinakaran (Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, a BJP ally now) – definitely doesn’t hurt the BJP. “There is a vacuum in Tamil Nadu.. which BJP sees. But it has underestimated the resistance offered by the civil society,” he said. Having said that, Manivannan agrees that caste continues to play a dominant role in voting behaviour. “The Dravidian social reform movement is one of its kind, laudatory and has served the people well. The flip side is, everything gets tucked under the carpet. A lot of things, especially accountability, get buried,” he said. This is where spaces open up for Modi to exploit — as he did in Vellore on Wednesday. “DMK has the first copyright on corruption,” Modi alleged, and claimed that thousands of crores of rupees sent by the Centre gets consumed by DMK’s corruption. What also helps the BJP on the ground is the work silently undertaken by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh cadre. Over the last five years, the number of RSS shakhas in the state have almost doubled to 2,400, say sources in the RSS. MP Mariappan, a Dalit RSS worker, who travelled 40 km to Vellore Kottai (fort) from Varadhareddipalli panchayat in the district, to attend Modi’s rally on Wednesday morning, said, “We are not in the forefront. We work quietly behind the scenes.” The traditional voting pattern of Dalits is changing, Mariappan claimed. “Earlier, SC votes in my panchayat went only to the DMK. Now, 600 out of 1,140 Dalit votes in my panchayat are for the BJP.” He speaks Hindi quite fluently and has worked in Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh and Dehradun in Uttarakhand. Indeed, for any party to win, SC votes are critical. As per the 2011 Census, the Scheduled Caste or Dalits accounted for 21.85 per cent of Vellore district’s population. While Varadhareddipalli panchayat may not be representative of other villages; it, however, suggests possibilities for the BJP. Attacking the DMK, Modi said the party has become a “one family company” – a theme that he uses to club the DMK and its key ally Congress in the same bracket. “To contest from DMK, you need to have these three criteria: family politics, corruption, anti-Tamil culture. DMK has trapped its youth in old politics; hence, the TN youth is unable to step forward,” he said, canvassing for BJP and its alliance partners in north Tamil Nadu. In Vellore, AC Shanmugam, who has a large education business, was originally with the AIADMK, and later founded the New Justice Party, is the BJP candidate. A Mudaliar by caste, he had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and polled 4,77,199 votes, but lost to DMK’s Kathir Anand by a narrow margin of 8,141 votes. The constituency has a strong presence of Vanniyars, Mudaliars and Muslims. Muslims accounted for 10.54 per cent, and Christians 2.82 per cent, of the population in Vellore district, according to the 2011 Census. Together with Dalits, they made up 35.21 per cent of Vellore district’s population in 2011. While Vanniyars are said to account for a large percentage of the population in north Tamil Nadu districts, there are no reliable estimates of the size of the community in the absence of a caste census. So is the case with other big communities such as Mudaliars. But, the Tamil Nadu government had previously tried to provide 10.5 per cent special internal reservation to Vanniyars within the 20 per cent quota for Most Backward Communities; this was quashed by the Supreme Court in March 2022. Muslim voters, who are in large numbers in Vaniyambadi and Ambur Assembly constituencies within the Vellore parliamentary seat, believe Kathir Anand will win. Their votes, they said, will go to the strongest candidate against the BJP. A Congress leader, who did not wish to be named, however, said Kathir Anand faces considerable anti-incumbency. An uphill task lies ahead for him, the leader said, adding that votes will be largely for the party, not necessarily the candidate. The party is also counting on SC votes. In 2019, while the elections were scheduled to be held on April 18, they were rescinded by the President after the Election Commission reported use of money power to influence voters. The Income-Tax department had recovered huge cash from an alleged associate of Durai Murugan, father of Kathir Anand, who was in the fray. Polling was then held on August 5, 2019, the day Article 370, was abrogated. In his public address, Modi sought votes for the NDA candidates in other north Tamil Nadu constituencies including Sowmiya Anbumani, daughter-in-law of PMK founder Ramadoss, and wife of Anbumani Ramadoss, who has been fielded from Dharmapuri; K Balu of PMK who is pitted against DMK’s S Jagathrakshakan, the sitting MP; and K Asuvathaman who is contesting from Thiruvannamalai.    "," Jothi Pandian and Shiva Kumar, two young men who run a small office a couple of kilometres from the Saint Gobain glass factory, off the Chennai-Sriperumbudur highway, couldn’t agree if sitting Lok Sabha MP and DMK candidate DM Kathir Anand would retain his seat in Vellore, a neighbouring constituency.

That a victory here is a victory for local and regional development and is also a significant part of the national effort to ensure a third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” With religious sites like Kedarnath and Badrinath, landmarks such as Jim Corbett National Park, and areas impacted by critical issues like Joshimath under its jurisdiction, the importance of Uttarakhand’s Garhwal defines the campaign of Baluni, who is fighting his first Lok Sabha polls from the constituency. Elections here are on April 19. At 9 am on a Sunday, after a traditional breakfast, he sets off on the campaign trail — in a white kurta-pyjama, a blue jacket, a saffron scarf featuring the lotus, and canvas shoes. The day’s itinerary entails a visit to the Ghantakarna Devta temple in the morning and a Ganga aarti at Devprayag Sangam in the evening. Additionally, his campaign team has identified 18 stops, including numerous public gatherings and “nukkad sabhas” (street corner meetings). “Campaign in the hills is very  different. Villages here are in the interiors. The people love us, which is why they came to the roads. We share our greetings and move to the next destination. We do this at 25-30 spots in a day on average. The plan is to cover around 300 km every day,” Baluni tells The Indian Express as his cavalcade makes a brief halt. He gets down from his vehicle and greets a group of women holding BJP flags and raising slogans of “Aa gayi Bhajapa, chha gayi Bhajapa” and “Anil Baluni zindabad.” After clicking selfies with them, he seeks their permission to leave and resumes his journey to the temple. “During campaigning, we can’t spend the night at the same place we started our day. Even the meals are not decided. I have a breakfast of roti-sabzi or paratha-dahi. I carry some fruits in my car, and for lunch, we generally get dal-bhat (rice and lentils) prepared by supporters. Then there is a cup of evening tea, if there is time, and a simple dinner at whichever hotel I am staying in,” says Baluni. “The temperature fluctuation also has its challenges. If I am in Kedarnath Vidhan Sabha, the temperature will be around 10 degrees. But suddenly if I go to Kotdwar, the temperature increases threefold. All of this causes throat infection so I gargle with hot water and take steam every day,” he says. Baluni, who serves as the national chief spokesperson for the BJP, was selected as the party’s Rajya Sabha candidate from Uttarakhand in 2018. The last time he contested an election was in 2005, when the Supreme Court ruled the cancellation of his nomination from the Kotdwar Assembly seat in 2002 as unjust. Subsequently, by-elections were conducted in 2005, which he lost. Baluni says the current campaign is different in the sense that he is now the BJP media head, and thus much more experienced and with a better understanding of how an election campaign works. A team from Delhi keeps him updated on major social media developments related to his campaign. At the same time, he continues his duties as the national media in-charge, keeping a tab on updates from across the country. Around 4 pm, as his cavalcade reaches Maletha area, a meal is prepared by local BJP MLA Vinod Kandari at his office there. Half an hour later, the journey resumes. Addressing a gathering of 50-60 people in the Kirti Nagar area, Baluni promises that the whole of Uttarakhand will be developed in Modi’s third term — from people migrating back to the state to employment for every household. He says the new Rishikesh-Karanprayag railway line will transform the area and bring a surge in tourism. From vaccines for all at the height of the pandemic and free ration to over 80 crore individuals, Ayushman cards, implementation of Kisan Samman Nidhi, and allocation of housing to 4 crore people, Baluni says the work of the Centre finds an echo in each home in the state. “People recognise that this election is about choosing the Prime Minister, making it a vote for Narendra Modi… Looking ahead, our agenda focuses on ‘developed India, developed Uttarakhand, and developed Garhwal’. We are committed to developing destinations, curbing migration, and ensuring employment opportunities in every household, with tourism serving as the primary driver,” he says. He also takes on the Congress for questioning the valour and bravery of the country’s first Chief of Defence Staff, the late General Bipin Rawat. Baluni is up against Congress’s former state president Ganesh Godiyal, a two-time MLA from the Thalisain seat (removed in 2012 following the delimitation) and Srinagar constituency. Godiyal had lost the 2022 election from the Srinagar seat to BJP’s Dhan Singh Rawat, with a narrow margin of 587 votes. The Garhwal Lok Sabha constituency comprises 14 Vidhan Sabha segments — Badrinath, Tharali, Karnaprayag, Kedarnath, Rudraprayag, Devprayag, Narendranagar, Yamkeshwar, Pauri, Srinagar, Chavbattakhal, Lansdowne, Kotdwar, and Ramnagar. These segments fall within five districts — Chamoli, Rudraprayag, Tehri Garhwal, Pauri Garhwal, and Nainital. In the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections, the BJP emerged victorious in 13 of these Vidhan Sabha seats, leaving Badrinath as the sole assembly seat held by the Congress. However, the incumbent Congress MLA Rajendra Singh Bhandari recently defected to the BJP. In 2014, the seat was won by senior BJP leader and former Uttarakhand chief minister Major General (Retd) Bhuwan Chandra Khanduri, who defeated senior Congress leader Harak Singh Rawat. In 2019, former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat secured the seat for the BJP after defeating Congress’s Manish Khanduri, who recently joined the BJP. Around 7.30 pm, Baluni reaches the Devprayag Sangam, where the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers converge to form Ganga, for the evening aarti. “I started the campaign from Ghantakarna Devta temple and ended at the Devprayag Ganga aarti. The day could not have been any better,” he says. Back at the hotel, Baluni says, they will discuss all that happened during the day, the response they received, what the Opposition did, and plan for the next day. On several occasions in the recent past, including his rally this month in Uttarakhand’s Rudrapur and his visit to Kedarnath in 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the current decade will be the “Decade of Uttarakhand”. “Today Uttarakhand has all kinds of modern connectivity. The BJP has given 85,000 houses to the poor, water connection to 12 lakh houses, over 5.5 lakh toilets, free gas connection to 5 lakh women, property cards to 3 lakh people under the Swamitva Yojna, and opened bank accounts for 35 lakh people in the state. The BJP has directly deposited Rs 2,200 crore in the bank accounts of small farmers of Uttarakhand… When your intentions are right, things work out like this,” the PM said in a recent speech in Rudrapur. These words will find an echo in Baluni’s campaign as he moves to the next stop.    "," That a victory here is a victory for local and regional development and is also a significant part of the national effort to ensure a third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” With religious sites like Kedarnath and Badrinath, landmarks such as Jim Corbett National Park, and areas impacted by critical issues like Joshimath under its jurisdiction, the importance of Uttarakhand’s Garhwal defines the campaign of Baluni, who is fighting his first Lok Sabha polls from the constituency.

His father Balram Das Tandon was former Punjab Deputy CM,"For the Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat, the BJP on Wednesday replaced two-time sitting MP Kirron Kher with Sanjay Tandon, a former Chandigarh BJP chief and the son of former Punjab Deputy CM Balram Das Tandon. Here are the reasons why the party preferred a new candidate over the incumbent MP. Ten years into her Lok Sabha tenure, Kirron Kher has failed to get rid of the “outsider” tag. Only last month, the actor-politician said, “I left my family and profession to live and work in Chandigarh for the past 10 years”. But senior BJP leaders insisted that a local candidate should be preferred. Kher’s name was missing from the list of four names the local selection committee sent to the central leadership, citing that people in Chandigarh need “a local candidate” this time. The December 2021 civic polls in Chandigarh, in which debutant AAP won a majority, were an eye-opener for the BJP. While the AAP got 14 councillors in the general house of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, the BJP tally came down from 20 seats in 2016 to 12. Sanjay Tandon is the longest-serving president of Chandigarh BJP, holding the post from 2010 till 2019. It was during Tandon’s stint that the party won the Lok Sabha polls back-to-back as well as the Chandigarh civic elections. After this success, Tandon became the co-in-charge of Himachal Pradesh BJP. Tandon’s father Balram Das Tandon, a lifelong RSS worker, was the Punjab deputy CM from 1969 to 1970 and later the Governor of Chhattisgarh between 2014 and 2018. The Congress’s Pawan Bansal won Chandigarh three straight times starting in 1999. In 2014, the BJP fielded Kher in what was her debut election. Asked about her tenure, Federation of Sector Welfare Associations of Chandigarh chairperson Baljinder Singh Bittu told The Indian Express, “None of the city’s outstanding issues has been resolved. Traders are suffering, and so are residents of housing boards… She did nothing and spent her MPLAD budget on insignificant civic works. It is different when a local candidate is your MP.” He alleged there was no significant work done in the last 10 years. Bittu also spoke of Kher’s alleged unavailability, contradicting her claim. “People couldn’t meet her. She was hardly there in Chandigarh. Had she been repeated this time, people wouldn’t have voted for her… They wanted a local candidate,” he said. After the fiasco during the Chandigarh mayoral polls in February in which presiding officer Anil Masih was caught on security cameras invalidating votes of AAP and Congress councillors to give the BJP a win — it was overturned with a stern rebuke by the Supreme Court — the party is desperate to repair the damage. The controversy, just a month before the Lok Sabha polls were announced, has greatly dented the party’s image. A candidate change deflects some of the negativity surrounding the party at the moment. Down the years, Tandon’s accessibility and visibility in Chandigarh played a big part in the ticket going to him. On the other hand, despite Kher having prepared for an honourable exit by announcing she was keeping unwell, there was an undercurrent of anti-incumbency against her. Local BJP leaders concede that Kher got a second chance in 2019 only “due to a Modi wave”. “If Kher got another chance, it was due to the Modi wave. When PM Modi addressed a rally here in 2019, he only told people to vote for him… He didn’t mention Kher even once,” said a senior BJP leader in the Union Territory.    "," For the Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat, the BJP on Wednesday replaced two-time sitting MP Kirron Kher with Sanjay Tandon, a former Chandigarh BJP chief and the son of former Punjab Deputy CM Balram Das Tandon. Only last month, the actor-politician said, “I left my family and profession to live and work in Chandigarh for the past 10 years”. Kher’s name was missing from the list of four names the local selection committee sent to the central leadership, citing that people in Chandigarh need “a local candidate” this time. Asked about her tenure, Federation of Sector Welfare Associations of Chandigarh chairperson Baljinder Singh Bittu told The Indian Express, “None of the city’s outstanding issues has been resolved."
510,"In Rampur, an absent Azam Khan is omnipresent: in SP unit’s revolt, ally Congress’s warmth, BJP’s hopes",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/azam-khan-rampur-sp-units-bjp-9262938/,"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/azam-khan-in-rampur.jpg?resize=450,253","APRIL 11, 2024","With SP candidate Mohibbullah not Khan's choice, district leaders have turned their backs. But while sorry for Khan and family, Muslims may put keeping out BJP first","Rampur is buzzing ahead of Eid and the countdown to the April 19 elections. But, outside the imposing residence of senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and former Lok Sabha MP Azam Khan on Jail Road, there is silence. The doors to the house are closed and the lane outside empty. Neighbours say visitors and hangers-on have dried up since the arrest of Khan, once one of the most powerful politicians of Uttar Pradesh, as well as that of his wife and son. Rampur Jail, where his wife, former Rajya Sabha MP Tazeen Fatma, is imprisoned is hardly 200 metres from the Khan residence. In times past, poll season would have seen SP leaders making a beeline for the Jail Road address. Rampur can’t remember the last time when a Khan family member or a leader recommended by him was not contesting on the SP ticket. This time, SP national president Akhilesh Yadav, who has had a prickly relationship with Khan – like other leaders belonging to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav’s time – has given the Rampur ticket to a cleric from Delhi, Mohibbullah. Khan apparently wanted Akhilesh to contest, and after he refused, recommended his old-time aide Asim Raja. While Raja even filed his nomination papers as “the SP candidate”, the papers were rejected during scrutiny. Now, the SP district organisation, whose leaders owe their loyalty to Khan, is in revolt, questioning the choice of Mohibbullah, who has been the imam of a mosque on Parliament Street in New Delhi for the past 20 years. Mohibbullah’s election office in-charge and cousin Maqtoob Ahmed complains that SP district president Ajay Sagar as well as Raja, the SP Rampur chief, have chosen to be “neutral”. “Neither they nor their people are supporting us. Former SP district president Virendra Goel is working for the BSP,” Ahmed says, adding that while they haven’t complained to the high command, they would raise the issue when Akhilesh comes for a rally to Rampur on April 14. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Azam Khan had won from Rampur by a 1.1-lakh vote margin against the BJP’s Jaya Prada. The SP had an alliance with the BSP at the time, while the Congress candidate got 35,009 votes. But in 2022, Khan – a 10-term MLA from Rampur Sadar – chose to contest the Assembly polls. In the bypoll held for the Rampur Lok Sabha seat, amidst allegations of large-scale intimidation, the BJP won by around 42,000 votes. Later, after conviction in a case, Khan was disqualified as the Rampur Sadar MLA. The BJP won that seat too in a bypoll. Raja, who along with Sagar had earlier threatened to boycott the Lok Sabha polls in Rampur if Akhilesh did not accept the ticket, says he is staying out as he is “resting” due to health reasons. However, Goel is open about his “revolt against the party candidate” and about working for the BSP, which has fielded a property dealer and political debutant, Zeeshan Khan. Goel says the nomination to an “outsider” Mohibbullah is aimed at ending the politics of Azam Khan. “No one will be able to change the ‘nizam’ of Rampur. All of Azam’s supporters are against Mohibbullah.” However, on the flip side, this means that Khan’s opponents, long held at bay, are coming out in support of Mohibbullah. At a meeting held by Mohibbullah Tuesday in preparation for Akhilesh’s rally, one of those present was Congress leader Afroz Ali Khan. In 1996, Afroz had won the Rampur Sadar Assembly seat defeating Khan, but the latter had gone on to best him in 2002 and 2007 Assembly polls. Afroz, who talks of perfect coordination between the SP and Congress which are contesting as allies, claims Mohibbullah will also get the support of Begum Noor Bano, the two-time Congress MP from Rampur (1999 and 1996) and a member of the erstwhile Rampur royal family. She and Khan have been in a long-standing battle of one-upmanship in Rampur. Afroz says a meeting between the two sides took place last week. “The Begum would be invited for the (Akhilesh) rally. She is supporting the alliance candidate.” In Rampur, Mohibbullah is also getting the support of the Aam Aadmi Party, the SP and Congress’s INDIA ally. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal’s photographs are on the posters of Mohibbullah, along with those of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and Akhilesh. Local AAP leaders, like their Congress counterparts, are part of the preparations for Akhilesh’s rally. The AAP has a presence in Rampur, with its candidates winning the 2023 polls for chairperson of Rampur Nagar Palika Parishad and Kaimri Nagar Panchayat. The BJP, in alliance with the Apna Dal (S), won three Nagar Palika chairperson posts here. SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary says the party is confident of winning over those upset with the ticket to Mohibbullah. However, there is some unease within the Congress too. Haji Ikram Qureshi, a former MLA named by the Congress as Rampur coordinator, is also missing from the scene. “An SP candidate is contesting. If there had been a Congress candidate, I would have been camped there,” he says. Rehmatullah, a retired teacher, says Mohibbullah should still win easily from Rampur. “He is a cleric and all the Muslims will support him; they vote here either for the SP or Congress. They voted for Azam Khan too because of the SP. Only those loyal to him might not support Mohibbullah,” Rehmatullah says, while adding that a win for Mohibbullah would mean “the end of the clout of Azam”. “He will replace Azam as the Muslim face of the SP in the region.” An SP worker points out that while Azam Khan’s photographs figure on Mohibbullah’s posters, his name is missing from party slogans. The BJP has refielded Ghanshyam Singh Lodhi, who won the Rampur Lok Sabha seat in the 2022 bypoll. Leaders of its minority wing and the Apna Dal (S)’s Suar MLA, Shafeek Ahmed Ansari, are reaching out to Muslims to canvass for Lodhi. A BJP leader says they are hopeful that “in the absence of Azam, some Muslims may vote for the BJP… at least those who are getting free rations”. Rajeev Manglik, a Rampur BJP leader, says: “The BJP government has done development here. We are contesting on that and good governance. People are with us also because we fulfilled the promise of Ram Temple. Since the opening of the temple in January, we have taken around 5,000 locals to Ayodhya for ‘darshan’.” Azam Khan was jailed first in February 2020 over alleged forgery of his son Abdullah’s birth certificate, to make him eligible to contest elections. He was released on bail by the Supreme Court in May 2022, but was again arrested in October last year after being convicted in a hate speech case lodged during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This led to his disqualification as MLA. Tazeen Fatma is lodged in Rampur jail, and Abdullah in Hardoi prison. Abdullah also stands disqualified as the Suar MLA, after conviction in February 2023 in a case of “blocking traffic”. In Rampur, where Muslims make up around 52% of the population, the community sympathises with Khan and family. But, they add, the BJP is a bigger concern. “I have been voting for the SP, and this time too I will vote for a candidate who can defeat the BJP,” says Mahmood, a farmer in Suar area. Blending caste with faith, BJP tries to open a space            "," But, outside the imposing residence of senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and former Lok Sabha MP Azam Khan on Jail Road, there is silence. This time, SP national president Akhilesh Yadav, who has had a prickly relationship with Khan – like other leaders belonging to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav’s time – has given the Rampur ticket to a cleric from Delhi, Mohibbullah. Now, the SP district organisation, whose leaders owe their loyalty to Khan, is in revolt, questioning the choice of Mohibbullah, who has been the imam of a mosque on Parliament Street in New Delhi for the past 20 years.

511,"The ‘missing’ seven: As AAP hits the streets, most of its 10 MPs are not on the ground",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/aap-protests-missing-mps-9262822/,"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/AAP_743f5d.jpeg?resize=450,253","APRIL 11, 2024","Asked about the “silence” of fellow AAP Rajya Sabha MPs, Sanjay Singh said Wednesday: “The party will discuss this at its own fora.”","SINCE THE arrest of its national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on March 21, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has held several protests in Delhi as well as in other parts of the country. Most of its 10 Rajya Sabha members, however, have been conspicuous by their absence at these protests – with Sanjay Singh, Sandeep Pathak and N D Gupta the exceptions. After the defection of its lone Lok Sabha MP, Sushil Kumar Rinku, to the BJP recently, these MPs remain the AAP’s only parliamentarians. Asked about the “silence” of fellow AAP Rajya Sabha MPs, Sanjay Singh said Wednesday: “The party will discuss this at its own fora.” Since he was released on bail by the Supreme Court in the Delhi excise policy case for which Kejriwal too has been arrested, Sanjay Singh has become the face of the party protests. Pathak, the AAP’s national general secretary (organisation), is the other prominent Rajya Sabha MP part of the protests, apart from N D Gupta, who is one of the party’s senior-most MPs and its treasurer. While Gupta is generally not active on X, he has been actively involved in the party’s affairs and was part of AAP protests at Ramlila Maidan on March 31 and at Jantar Mantar on April 7. The Indian Express reached out to the seven AAP Rajya Sabha MPs missing from the ground: Generally a vocal leader and face of the party’s press conferences against the Modi government, Chadha, the Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab, left for London last month for an eye surgery. While he was originally scheduled to return towards end-March, only his wife Parineeti Chopra, whose film Amar Singh Chamkila is coming up for its Netflix release, returned while he stayed back. Since Kejriwal’s arrest on March 21, Chadha has routinely tweeted in support of the AAP chief and the party. When Sanjay Singh was released from jail, he posted an old photo of him and the MP, expressing his happiness at the bail. He also reposted a video of Kejriwal’s wife Sunita delivering her husband’s “message” from jail to AAP MLAs to “continue working for the public”. Chadha was unavailable for comment but sources close to him said his return is delayed as the post-surgery instructions for his retinal detachment surgery are to not go out in the sun. “As soon as he is given the clearance by doctors, he will be back and join party activities on the ground, a party leader said. A first-time MP from Delhi, Maliwal is in the US, and has told the party she needs to be there as her sister is recuperating from an illness. Maliwal has been posting messages of support for the party and its leaders on social media. When the BJP alleged that many AAP leaders were not coming out in support of Kejriwal, she called it “fake news.” Speaking to The Indian Express, Maliwal said: “My sister has been living in the US for the past 15 years. She is ill and I am here to support her. I am coming back soon and will strongly fight against the dictatorship of the current regime. The arrest of Mr Arvind Kejriwal is a brutal assault on the democratic system of the country. The people of the country are anguished by the misuse of agencies. I shall always fight against oppression and injustice, the way I have been doing the past 20 years, especially during my work at the DCW.” A former India cricketer, Harbhajan has rarely participated in AAP activities since becoming a Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab. On Kejriwal’s arrest, he has been silent, with most of his recent posts on X being about the ongoing IPL. On March 24, he congratulated Punjab Chief Minister and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann on the birth of his daughter. Asked whether he would participate in the protests planned by the AAP, he told The Indian Express, “No.” He did not elaborate further. The founder of Punjab-based Lovely Professional University and an AAP MP from the state, Mittal has also been largely absent from party activities. On X, he has been tweeting about the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in Geneva, held between March 23 and 27, in which he participated. Now back, Mittal told The Indian Express: “I am not authorised to talk about this (the AAP protests). The party headquarters will tell us what is to be done.” He also claimed he had not been invited to a recent protest held by the party. Another MP from Punjab, Arora said he had met Sunita on March 24, after Kejriwal’s arrest, but admitted skipping the INDIA bloc protest at Ramlila Maidan over it. Arora said he could not attend as he had been given “duties” by the party in Ludhiana. “I have always fulfilled responsibilities given to me. I am in constant touch with N D Gupta ji, who is our leader in the Rajya Sabha. If I am asked to come for a protest, I will be there,” he told The Indian Express. An environment activist and an AAP Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab, Seechewal has also not been seen at most party protests. When asked about his absence, he said, “I am a man of religion and am fulfilling my duties. If there is any plan, we will share it.” While Sahney has been largely absent from AAP activities and silent over Kejriwal’s arrest, over the past few days, he has posted on X videos of his interaction with students at Stanford University and at a gathering in the memory of author Khushwant Singh. While he was not available for comment, sources close to Sahney said that he has said several times that he is “non-political”. And that, “though he is quite vocal about issues in Punjab, he is a philanthropist engaged in skilling youth and drug de-addiction”.
