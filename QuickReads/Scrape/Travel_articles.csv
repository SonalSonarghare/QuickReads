With its unique culture, cuisine and stunning natural beauty, it's no wonder why Japan is a popular destination for travelers from around the world. From ancient temples to modern cities, there is something for everyone — making it the perfect place for a memorable vacation. However, Japan can also be incredibly expensive, thanks to the high cost of food, lodging and airfare. The solution? Points and miles.  Traveling to Japan using points and miles is a great way to experience this fascinating country's culture, cuisine and natural beauty without breaking the bank. With an abundance of airline rewards programs offering flights from North America for as little as 40,000 miles round-trip, making your dream trip a reality with some strategic planning. From taking advantage of airline loyalty programs or signing up for credit cards with generous rewards points, there are plenty of ways for travelers looking for a budget-friendly journey through Japan. Here’s everything you need to know about traveling to Japan using points and miles: How to use points and miles to save money on travel Flying to Japan using airline miles is fairly attainable, with many airlines servicing Osaka and two airports in Tokyo (Haneda and Narita). Award rates are also reasonable for international travel, especially on business and first class. Here’s a look at the cheapest award flights to Japan, broken down by airline, along with ways you can earn the required miles through credit card welcome bonuses: The best credit cards with no international fees All Nippon Airways is a Japan-based Star Alliance carrier with many direct flight options. ANA Mileage Club offers some of the lowest mileage rates to Japan, starting at just 40,000 round-trip in economy class. ANA utilizes a seasonal award chart, with prices varying during low, regular and high season. ANA miles are easy to earn, thanks to a 1:1 transfer partnership with American Express Membership Rewards. With the current welcome bonuses offered by American Express, you can book up to two round-trip tickets to Japan on points alone. Here’s a look at credit cards that earn Membership Rewards points you can transfer to ANA Mileage Plan: The best credit cards for airport lounge access Alaska Airlines partners with Japan’s flagship carrier, Japan Airlines, making it an excellent program for getting to Japan using points and miles. Other Alaska partners that fly to Japan include American Airlines and Korean Air. First-class tickets are cheap relative to most other loyalty programs, at just 140,000 miles round-trip. Best of all, Alaska Airlines offers a free stopover on international itineraries. So you can add another city in Japan (or another country) to your trip without redeeming more miles. Unfortunately, Alaska miles are a little harder to come by since Alaska Mileage Plan doesn’t partner with any major transfer programs. Instead, you can use two co-branded credit cards to earn enough miles for a trip to Japan. Granted, you won’t earn enough for a first-class ticket, but you could generate enough for economy or business class. How to get major perks at global events and concerts with your credit card Virgin Atlantic Flying Club is a great program if you want to get to Japan cheaply using points and miles. Virgin Atlantic offers some of the lowest business class award prices — you can even fly All Nippon Airways, which has one of the best business class cabins in the sky. The airline’s “The Room” seat features a fully-enclosed suite on par with many top first-class seats. The best part? It will cost you just 90,000-95,000 miles round-trip. While Virgin Atlantic’s award tickets to Japan cost more than ANA’s tickets, there is one major caveat to consider: Virgin Atlantic Flying Club points are some of the easiest to earn. You can transfer Flying Club points at a 1:1 ratio from American Express Membership Rewards, Bilt Rewards, Capital One, Chase Ultimate Rewards and the Citi ThankYou program. Several of these programs offer enough points from credit card welcome bonuses to cover at least one round-trip ticket to Japan: American Express Gold Card review: a 'gold' standard with impressive benefits American Airlines remains the only domestic carrier that still publishes an award chart. This is great if you’re saving up for a trip to Japan because you’ll know exactly how many points you need, regardless of travel dates. American AAdvantage has pretty competitive rates on flights to Japan. The airline operates several direct flights to Japan, though you can also use miles to book tickets on Japan Airlines. American AAdvantage miles are relatively easy to earn, thanks to multiple credit cards available through Citi and Barclays. You can accrue enough miles for at least one round-trip ticket with 1-2 credit card welcome bonuses. American is also a 1:1 transfer partner of Bilt Rewards, though the Bilt Mastercard doesn’t currently offer a sign-up bonus. Traveling to Europe using points and miles Japan has no shortage of fantastic hotels and some of the best can be booked with points. All four major hotel chains (Hilton, Hyatt, IHG and Marriott) have properties throughout Japan where you can redeem your loyalty points for terrific value. There is really something for everyone: Budget travelers, luxury hotel connoisseurs, families and everyone in between.  Regardless of where you end up in Japan, there are lots of great hotels you can book with points — thanks to a selection of top-notch hotel credit cards. 10 incredible branded hotels that have boutique hotel vibes Your trip will likely start in Tokyo, which is a huge hotel market. We recommend staying at the iconic Park Hyatt Tokyo, which was made famous by the film Lost in Translation. Room rates start at just 25,000 Hyatt points per night and you can cover up to two nights with the welcome bonus from the World of Hyatt Credit Card or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. The best travel credit cards From there, you might want to hop on a train to Kyoto, where Marriott’s The Chapter Hotel strikes the perfect balance between luxury and affordability. While Marriott no longer publishes an award chart, you can book The Chapter Kyoto for around 50,000 points per night. Marriott also offers the fifth night free on award stays, incentivizing you to stay longer and explore the area more. The Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card* can help you cover up to two nights at this hotel. Best credit cards for traveling with kids When you’re ready to move on to Osaka, Hilton’s Conrad Osaka hotel offers a luxurious respite from the chaotic city. Rooms at this deluxe hotel go for around 95,000 points per night. You can cover at least one free night at the Conrad Osaka with the welcome bonus from the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card*. The card also provides automatic Gold elite status, providing valuable perks like complimentary breakfast and room upgrades. The card even lets you earn an additional free night award annually when you spend $15,000 annually. Best travel credit cards for hotels No trip to Japan is complete without an Onsen bath experience and the Hotel Indigo Hakone Gora offers them inside their spacious rooms. The hotel is also located just an hour from Mt. Fuji, making it a great base to explore the famed landscape. The hotel even has a free shuttle service from the Odawara train station, so you can get to it easily as you journey back to Tokyo. The Hotel Indigo Hakone Gora costs around 65,000 points per night, depending on the travel season. You can cover up to two nights on points with the welcome bonus from the IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card or by transferring points from the Chase Ultimate Rewards program.  10 amazing hotels around the world you can book with points Even if your airfare and hotel are covered with points, activities and transportation costs in Japan can add up substantially. Whether you want to experience a food-tasting tour around Tokyo or explore the country through the famous bullet train for a cross-country, you can cover these expenses with points and miles.  Several loyalty programs allow you to pay for expenses that are coded as travel with your points. For example, the Capital One Venture and Capital One Venture X cards let you redeem miles towards travel purchases at a rate of one cent each. Alternatively, you can redeem your Chase Ultimate Rewards points for tours, transportation and activities through the Chase Travel℠ portal. Points are worth 1.25 cents each with the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card and 1.5 cents each with the Chase Sapphire Reserve. While you’ll get more value when redeeming points for airfare and hotels, you can still use them for tours and activities to expand your travel budget. Points and miles are there to save you money on travel, so you should use them for that purpose when you see fit. The best credit cards for Global Entry Thanks to points and miles, traveling to Japan doesn’t have to be expensive or an arduous journey. ANA Mileage Club and Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan allow you to book tickets cheaply, even putting business and first class within reach. With the right credit card strategy, you can cover both airfare and hotel nights while having plenty of funds left over to splurge on meals and sightseeing in this beautiful country.

Plan your visit with this guide.,"If you’re not from Oregon and the Willamette Valley rings a bell, chances are you may know a bit about wine. Stretching from just south of Portland clear down to just south of Eugene, this region has been known as a hub for wine tourism for decades. While plenty of people travel to the Willamette Valley specifically to go wine tasting, this lush region offers so much more, from easy-to-reach hiking trails to quirky attractions sure to keep kids and grown-ups amused in equal measure. To help you plan your time and budget your trip, here's our guide to everything you need to know about the Willamette Valley. The Willamette Valley really shines during the summer months, when long, hot days give way to light-sweater weather at night. This is the time of year when festivals abound and sun-starved Oregonians come out in droves, eager to take advantage of the gorgeous – but fleeting – good weather of July and August. If you’re coming for wine tasting, summer is a particularly fantastic time to be in the area, when grapes are on the vine and Willamette Valley wineries open up their view-blessed terraces. However, Willamette Valley truly is a year-round destination. Fall is a beautiful time to visit, when area orchards and wineries are busy with the harvest. The Thanksgiving weekend is bustling in the northern part of the valley, when area wineries coordinate special events and releases. Winter slows things down a bit, with many wineries closing for the season, but you won’t have to compete much to secure a hotel reservation. Snowfall is rare, and when it does come down it’s typically only for a couple of days in the height of winter. The spring brings with it a mix of rain and sunshine, which results in vibrant rainbows and colorful blooms. Want to explore more of Oregon? Here's our seasonal guide Many people visit the region on a day trip from Portland, and it’s easy enough to hit up a few wineries and spend time taking in pastoral views along the way in just one day. Just make sure you go with a guide or have a designated driver. However, with two or three days in the Willamette Valley, you’ll be able to do some hiking or wine tasting and take in a few area attractions, without feeling rushed. The region is somewhat spread out, so it’s often easiest to just concentrate on one area at a time.

Straddling the South Saskatchewan River, it has been the province’s cultural and economic hub since its settlement in the late 19th century (but not its capital – that falls to Regina). The Northern Plains Indigenous Peoples had been guardians of this land for over 6000 years when, in 1883, white Methodists founded the town as a temperance colony, naming it after the purple berry growing in the region. While the railroad eventually reached the fledgling town in 1890, Saskatoon still only had 113 inhabitants at the turn of the century. A boom period of new settlers and entrepreneurs soon followed, and Saskatoon grew into a thriving city, albeit isolated from big cities like Vancouver, Toronto and Montréal. Today, the sometimes stark prairie landscapes around the city look like nowhere else in the country. Downtown, you’ll find street art tours, compelling museums, craft beer breweries, a variety of architecture and some fine riverside trails. And Saskatoon now proudly explains and celebrates the Indigenous Peoples who have been here for thousands of years, with the Wanuskewen complex a majestic and poignant monument to that past and present. These top tips can help you plan a trip to Saskatoon. Though Saskatoon – one of the sunniest cities in Canada – receives plenty of sunlight (2350.4 hours annually), winters are long and cold so plan to visit during the glorious summer months between June and August. This is the busiest time of year, but since Saskatoon is a little more under-the-radar than other Canadian cities, it’s not overwhelmed by tourists and offers much better value for money regarding accommodation and eating out.  The city comes alive with music on those effulgent summer days with magnificent festivals across multiple genres including the Saskatchewan Jazz Festival, Rock the River and the Ness Creek Music Festival. And for those who do want to embrace Saskatchewan winter scenes, the Nutrien Wintershines Festival hosts ice sculptures, cook-offs, stargazing and more.  Allow two to three days to explore Saskatoon, but also leave time for attractions on the city’s outskirts that make use of the abundant prairie space. You’ll spend the majority of your time in downtown Saskatoon, on the river trails and the Broadway neighborhood, which is ideal for a weekend. More planning is needed for the excursions out of the city, so map out an extra day or two for those depending on time and budget.

That's why we've gathered nine destinations that will make a big gathering an unforgettable experience.,"Organizing a group trip can be a daunting task. Deciding where to go, what to do and where you'll stay with a group of people — who all have their own opinions — can be challenging enough to nearly convince you not to go. But certain destinations are decidedly worth the hassle. Whether you are traveling with friends or with family, here are nine places that are perfect for your next group adventure.  The Berkshires in Massachusetts is a popular escape for many East Coast city dwellers due to the region's fall foliage and charming towns. Basing yourself in Great Barrington offers a wholesome oasis for any type of big group. Rent a house, preferably on a lake, and sit back and enjoy the long weekend. Great Barrington's quaint main street is worth an afternoon excursion. Flip through vinyl at Rob's Records, find your next favorite side table at The Berkshire Galleries of Great Barrington and round the day off with dinner at Prarie Whale.  For literature fans, The Berkshires were once home to many writers, including Edith Wharton. Take a day trip to visit her estate, The Mount, for history, culture and stunning architecture. And when all that relaxing starts to feel dull, break a sweat with a hike to the largest waterfall in Massachusetts, Bash Bish Falls. Is your group looking for an unforgettable adventure? Tanzania offers a wealth of group-centered activities, primarily in the bush. If it's always been your dream to catch a glimpse of the Big Five (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino), pack your friends or family into a Land Rover and head to the Serengeti. Spend your days cruising through the Ngorongoro Crater, enjoying cocktails under the stars, and getting a front-row seat to some of Earth's most fascinating creatures.

Here are our tips.","Often packed with as many visitors as there are roadside hawkers, Chiang Mai is one of Thailand’s most-loved destinations, offering a cool respite from the beaches and busy cities further south. While there’s a lot to do in town, the best experiences in Chiang Mai are often found in the province’s natural surroundings. And as with the rest of Thailand, the weather remains warm and pleasant year-round, rain and smoke can make or break even the best-planned vacation up north.  Scaling rugged mountains, braving the thrill of white water rapids, enjoying nature’s larder or forging connections with the local wildlife – these are the experiences that define Chiang Mai, whatever the weather. However, there's one specific time of the year when it might be wise to postpone your travel plans entirely. Here's our seasonal guide to help you make the right decision for you. Thailand never gets cold, but by November, the rain stops and cold fronts bring the temperatures down a notch (at night at least). This ushers in the “cool” season and officially marks the start of Thailand's high season when it comes to travel. And while the city is at its busiest over the Christmas and New Year weeks, there’s a lot more on offer in the way of tours, trips and cultural festivals that do a good job at dispersing crowds. Visit Chiang Mai at this time and you’ll see locals wearing sweaters as nighttime temperatures drop to 12–15°C (53–60°F) while sunseekers from cooler climes opt for shorts and loose tees. Yet wherever your bar sits, the cooler weather guarantees to make outdoor activities more bearable. During this time, parks and rivers that shut during the rainy season reopen, while the country’s highest mountain, Doi Inthanon, is even prone to a touch of morning frost. While there are plenty of peaks in Thailand where you can enjoy a sea of clouds – think Phu Chee Fah, Doi Pha Hom Pok or Doi Angkhang – there’s no place better than atop the towering pinnacle of Doi Luang Chiang Dao. Open for just November, December and January and limited to 150 people a day, it does take some planning, but the 360 views at sunset and sunrise are entirely worth it. The booking website is mainly in Thai, so try sending a message through the Facebook group to secure your space.

706,Travel,The ultimate guide to Miami's neighborhoods,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-neighborhoods-miami,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-04/GettyImages-1341718495.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"APRIL 25, 2024",Discover the best base for you on your Miami vacation with our insider guide to the city's best neighborhoods.,"Miami is a sprawling metropolis containing a multitude of cultures and attractions. While that makes for an incredible trip, it can be tricky for first-timers to figure out the best place to base themselves. It all depends on what you want to do and who you're traveling with. Are you downing cafecitos and cocktails before salsa dancing into the wee hours or kayaking and stretching out on a beautiful stretch of sand to relax? The best neighborhood for families is unlikely to have a thumping nightlife, but some areas offer a little bit of something for everyone. Think about your must-do priorities in Magic City (if you're in need of inspiration, check out our favorite things to do there) and let our guide to Miami's neighborhoods help you choose the best possible base for your vacation. If you want to get a taste of nearly everything the city has to offer, Downtown Miami is ideal. Marvel at some of the city's most historic buildings, dating as far back as the 1890s – among them, the Olympia Theater (originally a silent movie theater) and the Freedom Tower (once a help center for Cuban refugees in the 1960s and 70s). Spend some time exploring and snapping photos, then learn more about the city's past at the HistoryMiami Museum. But downtown is far from stuck in the past. Aside from the high rises, there are restaurants and retail to enjoy at Bayside Marketplace, plus boat tours on Biscayne Bay and a Ferris wheel that offers dazzling views of the neighborhood. Fancy some culture? The Pérez Art Museum boasts a robust collection of art from Latin America and beyond, while the adjacent Frost Science Museum is home to a spectacular aquarium, planetarium and rotating exhibits. And if that's not enough, you can always see what's happening at the Kaseya Center, home of the Miami Heat and a major entertainment venue. Formerly known as Little San Juan, this once-heavily Puerto Rican neighborhood has undergone tremendous change, most notably because of gentrification. Today, it's an international hub of art, fashion and design. Brilliant murals adorn nearly every building facade, many of which were created by top street artists like Shepard Fairey and Atomik. Throw a stone in any direction, and you're sure to hit an art gallery, cocktail bar, vintage shop, uber-hip clothing boutique or even a taco shop that doubles as a speakeasy. While there's a dearth of hotels in the area, you can book a room at the Moxy, Arlo or an Airbnb. Otherwise, venture into the neighborhood at your leisure and make a day of it by picking up an iced latte at Panther Coffee before wandering between the Wynwood Walls, Museum of Graffiti and The Art of Hip Hop. The vibe changes to adults-only at night – enjoy a delicious meal at Kush or Bakan, then bar hop between R House, Dirty Rabbit, Gramps or any other spot where the music's good. Surely the most visited area of Miami, South Beach continues to draw crowds for several reasons. First, it's the best neighborhood for beach access no matter where you stay – many hotels offer private access and even those that don't often offer amenities like chairs and umbrellas. Traveling with kids? Stay near South Point Park – they'll love the splash pads and waving to outgoing cruise ships from the pier. Prefer something more lively? Anywhere along Ocean Drive or even Washington Ave is excellent. Speaking of lively, the nightlife in South Beach is hard to beat. Popular staples like Mango's, The Clevelander and Nikki Beach are always a good time, but feel free to branch out. Do Not Sit On The Furniture is a small club with huge tunes delivered by guest DJs, while M2 gives you that bass-all-over-your-body immersive party experience. And if dives are more your scene, you can't go wrong with a night at the infamous Mac's Club Deuce (if it was good enough for Anthony Bourdain, it's good enough for us). Check out our favorite beaches – beyond South Beach Little Havana has plenty to offer in terms of culture and charm. Drive (or walk) along the infamous Calle Ocho, and you'll be greeted by giant, colorful rooster statues – a nod to the actual roosters that stroll about the area. While there, check out the Cuban Walk of Fame to see the names of some of the biggest stars from the island nation. Follow up with a visit to the Cubaocho Museum for some history lessons as well as a chance to peruse art. But the best thing about Little Havana? Hands down the opportunity to enjoy so many tasty dishes. Yes, this is understandably the best spot for Cuban cuisine and from Versailles to Sanguich, El Pub to El Rey de las Fritas – it's all delicious. But it's not just Cuban food on the menu – try Salvadoran food at El Atlakat, Nicaraguan food at Pinolandia or Yambo, or stop at La Casa de las Baleadas for Honduran fare. Your tastebuds will thank you. If you'd like to experience some of Miami's lesser-known gems, spend some time in Coconut Grove. Quieter than SoBe but still plenty lively, the Grove is Miami's oldest neighborhood. Take a glimpse into the city's past at Barnacle Historic State Park (built in 1891, at a time when Miami was only accessible by boat). Another must-see attraction is Vizcaya Museum & Gardens – this stunning waterfront villa, built in 1916, will make you feel like you've been transported to the Mediterranean. And if the weather's right, a stroll through the verdant Kampong Botanical Garden is a must. Wander over to CocoWalk to experience the modern side of the Grove, an open-air center with boutique shops, restaurants, bars, a movie theater and more. While much of this area has been revamped in recent years, many beloved old staples are still around: delightful French bistro Le Bouchon du Grove, GreenStreet Cafe (known for their incomparable brunches), Barracuda and Sandbar (popular drinking holes), The Last Carrot (perfect for healthy food options) and El Taquito (an excellent taqueria that's open late). Make sure you check the calendar because the Grove hosts all kinds of fun events, from farmer's markets to open-air concerts. If you're looking for a relaxing beach getaway with the kids, you simply can't go wrong with Key Biscayne. It's like a little world unto itself, with just one major road to get from one end to the other. Accommodations aren't plentiful – the Ritz Carlton is one of the few hotels in the area – but there are always Airbnbs available for the whole family (and you can still visit the Ritz for spa time). Once there, you can divide your time between Crandon Park and Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park. The former features one of the city's best Nature Centers, a mangrove boardwalk, guided hikes, plus plenty of space to enjoy the beach. Kiteboarding, kayaking and other eco-adventure tours are also available here. The beaches at Bill Baggs are just as lovely, with opportunities to explore the on-site lighthouse, as well as go fishing, hiking, swimming, paddling and biking (single and quad bikes are available for rent). And if you're traveling with a four-legged friend, nearby Hobie Beach (near adjacent Virginia Key) is also a great place to spend a few hours. Add these top experiences to your itinerary

Marvel at some of the city's most historic buildings, dating as far back as the 1890s – among them, the Olympia Theater (originally a silent movie theater) and the Freedom Tower (once a help center for Cuban refugees in the 1960s and 70s).

708,Travel,A Total Trip: What I spent on an expensive weekend in Copenhagen,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/what-i-spent-weekend-copenhagen,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-04/A-Total-Trip-CPH.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"APRIL 25, 2024","Learn what our writer spent on a weekend in Copenhagen, Denmark, as part of our A Total Trip series.","In our A Total Trip series, writers document what they spent on a recent getaway. In this edition, Chamidae Ford shows us how far her money went on a long weekend in Copenhagen, Denmark. I recently spent a sunny weekend in Copenhagen – a city known for its stunning architecture, signature design and burgeoning food scene – with my friend and coworker Ann Douglas. When planning this trip, I knew I’d only be there for a few days, and I also knew I wanted to taste delicious food and shop for a few souvenirs (or more than a few). As someone who lives in New York, I must acknowledge that my sense of what is deemed overpriced and what is ""normal"" is a bit skewed. Still, I will bare my spending soul if only to offer a grasp on what a weekend in this city may cost if you enjoy yourself rather than convert prices on a currency app. A goal for me was to do as little pre-trip spending as possible. Since I was already in Dublin for work, I took a short flight costing 679kr to Copenhagen.  For the hotel, I wanted a place that felt young and prioritized design, so it truly felt like we were in Copenhagen. I also looked for something central to avoid long commute times when visiting the main sites. We stayed at 25 Hours Hotel in Indre By, a pricier option but in a great location, and we split the cost of the room. For three nights, our stay was 5408kr, which means my portion was 2704kr, which I paid for with credit card points I had been saving. Pre-trip spending: 697kr Airport transfer: We landed in Copenhagen around 4:30pm, and we discovered that one of Copenhagen's finest perks is how straightforward it is to get from the airport to the city! Doing the same in London, Paris, or New York is a pricey, timely and exhausting feat; this was cheap (30kr) and fast. I got from the airport to my hotel in roughly 20 minutes. Activities: With a dinner reservation for 8pm (you must make dinner reservations in advance; Copenhagen is not the place for walk-ins), we spent a few hours taking in the early evening, the winding streets, and noting places we would like to visit the next day.  Apertivo: We stopped at Little Green Door, a cocktail bar along the canal, for a pre-dinner drink. We each enjoyed a single shot, gin and tonic for a whopping 131kr (262kr for both). After swiping my card, this was the moment I knew my weekend was going to be more expensive than I had anticipated. Dinner: In the evening, we dined at the intimate yet bustling Lilo Vinoria, a chic wine bar with Italian-inspired food and an extensive drink menu. I am unsure if it was because I had only consumed a single croissant that day due to travel or because I was coming off a week of pub food in Dublin, but this meal felt like everything I had ever needed.

Cabaret dancer Lola Kashmir doesn’t divulge her “real” name to me. When dancers perform their debut show at the Crazy Horse in Paris, they’re given a “Crazy Girls” name. Chosen for them based on their preferences, origins and dance style, this identity becomes so entrenched that even during a night out with her fellow dancers, Kashmir’s stage name never slips. Such illusion and mystique are what the Crazy Horse is all about. You’ve surely heard of the Moulin Rouge, where dancers high-kick in petticoats and tights. At the Crazy Horse, by contrast, performers take the stage dressed in no more than light and shadows. The famous Moulin Rouge first opened its doors in 1889. Its prevalence in popular culture – the joint loaned its name to not only Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 blockbuster but also John Huston’s 1952 musical – have made the theater and its illuminated red windmill famous the world over. (Even though for unclear reasons, the show goes on while new ones get installed.)

And it's easy to see why. The pocket-sized town is considered one of the most beautiful in Italy. Once a power to rival its mighty neighbor Amalfi, today Atrani, a UNESCO World Heritage site, takes home the award for smallest municipality in Italy. This enchanting beach town nestled between two mountains is perhaps the one town on the Amalfi Coast that has stayed most true to its original medieval structure. You can still walk through the original alleyways, courtyards, archways and the recognizable scalinatelle (little stairways) that make Atrani look like a Neapolitan nativity scene come to life. Like all villages on the Amalfi Coast, Atrani has long been a tourist destination due to the natural beauty of its location and landscape. Now, tourist interest in the town is rising even more because of the Netflix series Ripley, starring Andrew Scott, set in Atrani.  Explore more of the Amalfi Coast with our guide to the region's best experiences Because of its location and mild weather, the perfect time to visit Atrani is in late spring/early summer (April to June) or late summer/early fall (September to October). The tourist season usually soft-launches around Easter and explodes in mid-July. To engage in more sustainable tourism, try to avoid visiting in August, when Atrani is undoubtedly busiest and most crowded.  During the summer months, the Amalfi Coast welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors; this tourist gold rush benefits the local economy, but it’s important to also note the negative impact that overtourism has had. Some towns, including Atrani, have become physically and economically inaccessible at times because of how crowded they are, with prices skyrocketing due to all establishments being filled to the brink. That’s not even counting the irreparable damages to the environment and to the marine ecosystem.

711,Travel,Montréal vs Toronto: how do you choose between Canada's two biggest cities?,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/montreal-vs-toronto,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-04/toronto-vs-montreal-2024-update.png?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"APRIL 25, 2024",Which should it be: Montréal or Toronto? We asked two travel writers to make the case for the Canadian city closest to their hearts.,"Heading to Canada? You're in for a treat. However, it is the second-largest country in the world, and you won't be able to visit it all on one trip. Some sacrifices have to be made, which might include making a choice between the two largest cities. Should you base yourself in arty, festive Montréal, with its beautiful parks and welcoming vibe? Or should it be the diverse and energetic city of Toronto, with its delightfully varied food scene? We asked two travel writers to make the case for the Canadian city closest to their hearts. Though born in Ottawa, Joel Balsam has spent more than a decade living in Montréal on and off, and his father was born there. Joel also wrote the Québec chapter in the upcoming Lonely Planet Canada guidebook. As Canadians like to say: Toronto is where you work, Montréal is where you live. So as a traveler are you trying to dive into the grind or live it up? The latter? Yep, that’s what I thought. Toronto is all go, go, go, with huge skyscrapers and people who won’t stop to chat because they’re hustling to afford their rent or mortgage. It’s like Manhattan, but not quite as cool. Sadly, this has made Toronto the loneliest city in Canada. Meanwhile, Montréal has joie de vivre. A je ne sais quoi, as it were. Instead of talking about housing unaffordability, Montrealers discuss art, concerts and fun (also the ever-present road construction and language laws, but nobody’s perfect). Montréal’s streets are filled with free festivals all summer long, including Complètement Cirque, Mural and Festival International de Jazz. There’s always something fascinating to see at Musée des Beaux-Arts or Quartiers des Spectacles, and there are a near-infinite number of hip bars and clubs. Some people even call Montréal “Little Berlin,” affirming its happening status. Since Montréal was built mostly before cars, it’s more walkable than Toronto and many of its main thoroughfares are pedestrianized every summer. Just try and walk around Old Montréal’s tiny alleys without feeling a tingle of romance. The ruelles vertes (literally “green streets”), back alleys in neighborhoods like the Plateau and Villeray, are verdant, semi-secret ways to get around town.
