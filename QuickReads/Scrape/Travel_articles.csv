12 of the best things to do in Dublin,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-things-to-do-in-dublin,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-04/500pxRF106947325.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 10, 2024","Ireland's capital is small but mighty, with a wealth of wonderful things to see and do. Here are 12 things to do in Dublin to get you started.","Ireland’s capital and largest city by far, Dublin is one of those places that you either get straight away or spend a lifetime trying to figure out. It’s not the prettiest city, but Dubliners will remind you that pretty things are as easy to like as they are to forget…before showing you the showstopper Georgian bits to prove that Dublin has a fine line in sophisticated elegance. There’s a collection of museums as fine as you’ll find in any European capital and one of the world’s most beautiful university campuses. There’s incredible food and a collection of authentic pubs that have spawned imitators from Miami to Mongolia. There’s whiskey and old prisons, ancient books and beautiful monuments. In Dublin, you’ll find something that will tickle your fancy. And when you’re done, there’s always the world’s greatest beer, brewed right here for the last 300 years.   Whether it’s your first visit to Dublin or your 20th, this is a city that keeps on giving. Here are a few ideas to get you started. In all likelihood, you don’t need us to tell you that the pub is a quintessential Dublin experience, but here we are. It’s where you’ll meet Dubliners at their convivial, easy-going best and get a sense of what makes this city tick. There are few Dublin institutions so fawned over and written about as the traditional pub – probably because so many of the city’s best-known writers were regulars in them. In Ulysses, Leopold Bloom muses that 'a good puzzle would be to cross Dublin without passing a pub,' to which the only logical answer is that it can be done…by going into everyone you see. Given that there are around 800 of them spread about the city it’s probably not the wisest thing to do if liver function is important to you, but there are a bunch of them that will make your Dublin stay all the more memorable. One of my favorites is John Mulligan of Poolbeg Street, which was also a favorite of Leopold Bloom’s creator, James Joyce.   Since its foundation in 1592, Trinity College has become one of the world’s most famous universities; it's the alma mater of Swift, Wilde and Beckett; it's where you'll find the most beautiful library in the whole country and the home of the world’s most famous illuminated Gospel, the Book of Kells. The library’s 200,000 books have been removed as part of a landmark restoration project, but the consolation prize is an enhanced digital experience that tells the story of the Book of Kells in dramatic, impressive detail. Trinity’s 16 hectares are an oasis of aesthetic elegance, its cobbled quadrangles lined with handsome neoclassical buildings that lend an air of magisterial calm to the campus, evident as soon as you walk through Front Arch. Local tip: If you’re visiting during the summer – ie outside of term time – you can stay in student accommodation for a fraction of the cost of a hotel on the other side of the walls. See visittrinity.ie. Hanging on the walls of a magnificent Georgian pile is arguably the city’s finest collection of modern and contemporary art, which runs the gamut from impressionist masterpieces (Degas, Monet, Manet et al) to Irish artists such as Dorothy Cross and Sean Scully as well as a collection of stained-glass windows by Harry Clarke. The Dublin City Gallery (aka the Hugh Lane, after its founder)’s most visited installation, however, is Dublin-born Francis Bacon’s actual London studio, brought over piece by piece and painstakingly reassembled in all its glorious mess – you can't step inside it but you can observe exactly how the artist lived and worked, down to the minute details.  Check out these budget-friendly tips for Dublin. Did you know that Dublin was once the epicenter of the global whiskey industry? The industry went kaput throughout the 20th century, but it’s slowly making a major resurgence, not least in the Liberties, once known as the Golden Triangle for the number of distilleries in operation there. Today, there are four: Teeling Distillery, the first new producer in the city for 125 years; Pearse Lyons Distillery, in an old church; the Dublin Liberties Distillery in a 400-year-old former mill and tannery; and the return of Roe & Co, which was once the world’s largest producer of whiskey, inside the old Guinness Power Station. On the other side of the Liffey, the old Jameson Distillery is now one of the city’s most popular attractions, while if you want to do some pretty serious tastings, there’s the Irish Whiskey Museum near Trinity College. Alfred Chester Beatty was a mining magnate with exceedingly good taste, and the fruit of his aesthetic sensibility is gathered in this remarkable museum. Books, manuscripts and scrolls were his particular love, and his collection includes the world's second-oldest biblical fragment and a collection of Qurans from the 9th to the 19th centuries that is considered among the best example of illuminated Islamic texts in the world. Other treasures include ancient Egyptian texts on papyrus, intricately designed little medicine boxes and perhaps the finest selection of Chinese jade books on the planet. Keep an eye on the calendar of events – it regularly runs qigong workshops on the rooftop garden, as well as sound baths and meditation sessions. You didn’t think we’d ignore arguably the world’s most famous brewery and the number one tourist attraction in the city, did you? Guinness is more than a beer, and you’ll get a pretty good sense of how much more it is during a visit to the seven-story Guinness Storehouse. Along the way you’ll learn how the beer is made (there are a couple of add-on, hands-on experiences to really deepen that knowledge), the role of the company in Dublin’s fortunes and how it became the global brand it is today.  The top floor is an atrium bar, where you put the theory to the test and drink a pint; just below it is an excellent spot for lunch. Local tip: The Guinness in the atrium bar is excellent, but the best Guinness comes with atmosphere; you’ll find the best of it in a traditional bar (see above). Ireland’s struggle for independence was a bloody and tempestuous journey, and this forbidding prison on the western edge of the city played a role in it for nearly 150 years, as the forced temporary home of many a rebel and revolutionary. Unoccupied since 1924, Kilmainham Gaol is now a museum with an enthralling exhibit on the history of Irish nationalism. The guided tour of its grim cells and corridors is highly memorable and it finishes in the yard where the leaders of the failed 1916 Easter Rising were executed. Planning tip: Book your tickets online to avoid being disappointed by sold-out tours; also best to book for an early morning tour as you’ll be waiting for less time. With a collection donated entirely by the general public, the award-winning Little Museum of Dublin on St Stephen’s Green is a surprising blockbuster. The memorabilia is quirky enough – it includes a lectern used by JFK during his visit in 1963 and the fateful letter given to the Irish delegation during the negotiations that ended Ireland’s War of Independence in 1921 (and whose inherent contradictions led indirectly to the Civil War the next year) – but it’s a brilliant way of getting a potted history of the city. There’s even a whole floor dedicated to U2. Visits are by guided tour only, but they’re great fun.   Planning tip: The museum runs great tours beyond its walls, including a daily walking tour of St Stephen's Green, as well as a themed weekly tour telling the story of Ireland's influential women. Ireland’s most important cultural institution is the National Museum of Ireland, which has four branches nationwide – three of which are in Dublin. The National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology on Kildare Street is the most significant, with an extraordinary collection of Celtic and early Christian gold as well as the macabre ‘bog bodies’ – four Iron Age figures in various states of preservation. On the other side of the Liffey, just off the quays, is the Decorative Arts & History branch, housed in a beautiful 18th century barracks. On Merrion Square is the Natural History Museum, affectionately known as the ‘Dead Zoo.’   The choice of restaurants in Dublin has never been better. Every cuisine and every trend – from doughnuts on the run to kale with absolutely everything – is catered for, as the city seeks to satisfy the discerning taste buds of its diners. From Neapolitan style pizza at Sano to Michelin-starred feasts at Chapter One, you’ll find something for every mood and budget. One of the more popular trends in 2024 was for KFC – no, not that kind, but Korean Fried Chicken – with a bunch of authentic spots opening up all over town. One of my favorites is White Rabbit on Capel St, not-so-hidden in the back of a Korean grocery store.   Planning tip: It can be pretty tough to get a table at the trendiest spots in town, so book well in advance – two weeks if possible, but months if you’re looking for a Michelin-starred meal. Dublin is on the sea, and some of the city’s loveliest neighbourhoods are standalone villages worth exploring, not least the fishing village of Howth, at the end of the DART train line to the north. The village itself is gorgeous, built around a busy pier and packed with restaurants serving the freshest of fresh catch, but the real treat is the Howth Cliff Path Walk, a 6km (3.7 mile) loop that takes you over the headland for gorgeous views over the grassy slopes to the sea. If you want to do a proper hike, there are longer routes that lead to the Baily Lighthouse and back over rough, mountainous terrain. Local tip: On weekends and bank holidays, the Howth Market sells a huge selection of organic produce and baked goods as well as handicrafts.  Navigate like a local with these tips for getting around. OK, so the Book of Kells and the Old Library are way more famous, and way more visited, but that makes Marsh’s Library – on a side street by St Patrick’s Cathedral, all the more worthwhile. The magnificently preserved scholars' library founded by Archbishop Narcissus Marsh in 1701 has barely changed a jot since then: atop its ancient stairs are beautiful dark-oak bookcases filled with 25,000 books from the 16th century to the early 18th century, as well as maps, manuscripts (including one in Latin dating from 1400) and a collection of incunabula (books printed before 1500). Local tip: When you walk from the first hall into the second, strike up a conversation with the resident librarians. They can tell you their personal theories (or experiences) of the resident ghost and show you the spines of the books bearing bullet holes from the 1916 Easter Rising."
"The best time to visit Washington, DC",https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-time-to-visit-washington-dc,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/GettyImages-2052274111.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 9, 2024","Here's your guide to the seasons in DC, from when to see cherry blossoms in bloom, to when to avoid the crowds.","There's never a bad time to visit Washington, DC. Not only do brilliant events take place almost every day, but the district also undergoes breathtakingly beautiful transformations as the seasons change. March's explosion of cherry blossoms might well be the biggest magnet for many, but don't underestimate the beauty of a snow-dusted US Capitol in winter, fall foliage sessions at the city's National Arboretum, and lazy summer days cooling off by the Tidal Basin. Here are the pros and cons of visiting at different times of the year. January, February and March are the cheapest months to visit Washington DC, although February is your best bet – shoppers heading to the city for the January sales can push up prices at the start of the year, and the second half of March is when the cherry blossoms begin to bloom. Visit in February, and you can expect temperatures between 27°F and 47°F, along with odd snowfall. One minor downside is that, although all of DC's top attractions will be open, it's trickier to find guided tours during this time, as many pause operations between December and March. One important tip: avoid fixed-price restaurant menus around Valentine's Day, when restaurants hike up costs. On a budget? Check out these top things to do for free in Washington, DC March is when the city's cherry blossom trees burst with color. Working out exactly when the blooms will appear isn't an exact science, but it's usually in the second half of March. In early March, there are daily blossom updates for the city's indicator tree (yes, there really is such a thing), along with the best areas to spot them. Top spots include the National Mall, where you'll find cherry blossom trees gifted to the country by Japan; and the banks of the Tidal Basin, which is lined with trees.  For an extra dose of flower power, book a hotel with views of DC's cherry blossoms. These include several properties in the Wharf area, due to its proximity to the Tidal Basin. The InterContinental Washington DC, Hyatt House Washington DC and Canopy by Hilton Washington DC are all great options. Another ideal base is the Foggy Bottom neighborhood – book a hotel here, and you'll be a short walk from both the National Mall and the Tidal Basin.        "
The 8 best things to do in Miami,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-things-to-do-in-miami,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/GettyImages-1855617110.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 9, 2024","Visitors to Miami will find beautiful beaches, art deco delights, tropical gardens and a lively arts scene.","Miami is most known for being a hub of Latin American culture with a 24/7 party atmosphere, and that’s not wrong. But as one of the fastest growing metro areas in the country, the city clearly has even more to offer every sort of traveler.  So how do you choose where to spend your time and money in Miami? Yes, there are nightclubs and bars a-plenty. But there are also world-class museums, literary events, all kinds of sports, theater and more Latin cuisine than you ever even knew existed. No matter your interests, these are the best things to do in the Magic City. Cuban coffee is king in Miami, and there’s no better way to enjoy some than by ordering it from a ventanita – that is, a cafe window. Ventanitas serve not only as convenient coffee and snack spots, but also as spaces to have conversations and catch up on news and life. Versailles is a popular spot both for locals and tourists alike, but drive around Miami enough, and you’ll likely encounter several of these on-the-go coffee spots. Continue your Miami coffee tour at these amazing cafes Local Tip: Learn about the different types of coffee drinks ahead of time. Cafe con leche is akin to a sweet hot latte. A colada is more like several shots of sugary supercharged espresso served in a styrofoam cup, and it's meant to be shared.  You can’t visit Miami without dipping your toes in the warm Atlantic waters at least once. The best family-friendly beaches are Crandon Park and Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park – both great for barbecuing, biking and swimming. For more action and prime people-watching, stretch out on South Beach. Mid-beach all the way through Bal Harbour tends to have less public access, meaning slightly fewer crowds. If you hate tan lines and don’t blush easily, Haulover Beach (featuring the city’s only nude beach) might pique your interest.  Local Tip: If you can’t stand the heat and humidity but still love to hear the waves, walk onto the sand anywhere from South to North Beach after dark and spend some quiet beach time under the stars. Visit more of our favorite beaches in Miami There’s no shortage of boats to ride on in Miami, but you’ll want to choose the right experience for you. Many boat tours can be found in and around Bayside Marketplace (a tourist-friendly shopping and dining hotspot in Downtown Miami). These tend to vary from a general 1-2 hour “party boat” experience that takes you into Biscayne Bay with music and drinks, to millionaire mansion sightseeing tours, to sightseeing speedboat tours for those who enjoy a faster pace. There are other options, like private boat tours of Stiltsville and Biscayne National Park (parts of Miami that are only accessible by boat), as well as small sailing experiences out of Coconut Grove. Local Tip: Already have experience driving a boat? You can easily rent one by the hour for a more intimate boating experience.  What was once a few blocks of struggling art galleries has become a gentrified mass of high rises, restaurants, bars, and well, a lot more art. You can still visit some of the long-standing cultural institutions and galleries in the area like the Margulies Collection and the Wynwood Walls, as well as the Bakehouse Art Complex. More importantly, you can still find plenty of art by simply walking around the neighborhood – murals and graffiti have long been a staple here. And of course, don’t forget to bring your camera. The photo ops are endless. Local Tip: If you can deal with the crowds and traffic, visit during the first week of December for Art Basel – an international art show with multiple satellite events, many of which take place in and around Wynwood. It’s a great time for seeing new art (and even getting to watch street artists at work). No matter where you are in the 305, you’re bound to find an art museum nearby. North Miami is home to the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA NoMi), whose collection includes works by artists like Keith Haring and Anna Gaskell. The Bass Museum of Art in Miami Beach is one of the city’s oldest art museums, open since 1964. Both Florida International University and the University of Miami house their own art museums – the Frost in Sweetwater and the Lowe in Coral Gables, respectively. And if you want to see a truly impressive collection of Latin American art, make time for the Perez Art Museum. Local Tip: Many museums feature free days at least once a month. Check their websites for info and plan accordingly. The largest subtropical wilderness in the country, the Everglades is a magical place home to gators, crocs, turtles, frogs, snakes and dozens upon dozens of species of birds from cranes, ducks and geese, to anhingas, spoonbills and more. There are several entrances to Everglades National Park that feature nature centers, hiking trails and ranger-led experiences. You can also venture to businesses like Everglades Safari Park (not affiliated with the national park), where you can ride in an airboat along the river of grass. There are several entrances to Everglades National Park that feature nature centers, hiking trails and ranger-led experiences, with the closest entrance to greater Miami being via the Shark Valley Visitor Center. Local Tip: Pack plenty of bug spray and sunscreen for your visit. While beautiful, the environment of the Everglades can be rough on anyone. Add these Everglades experiences to your itinerary The Magic City’s got plenty going on when it comes to sports, though locals generally root hardest for the Miami Heat, our three-time NBA champs. You can catch them live at the Kaseya Center in the heart of Downtown Miami. If baseball is more your speed, tickets to see the Marlins are generally affordable for games at LoanDepot Park in Little Havana (fun fact: it’s one of the few baseball stadiums in the country with a retractable roof). And finally, football fans can root for the Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium up in Miami Gardens (and if college football is more to your liking, the University of Miami’s Hurricanes play up there as well). Local Tip: If tickets aren’t available, do as the locals do and head to the closest Flanigan’s to watch any and all games while enjoying beer and wings alongside other fans. The most famous street in Miami is undoubtedly Calle Ocho – in fact, it even has a festival named after it. While attending this annual block party is recommended at least once, you can still enjoy plenty of Cuban culture if you walk along the stretch of Calle Ocho that cuts through Little Havana. Pop into Los Pinarenos Fruteria for some guarapo (sugar cane juice), watch the elders playing dominos at Maximo Gomez Park, snap photos of the Cuban Walk of Fame and take in some more culture at the CubaOcho Museum. And of course, don’t forget to stop by Ball and Chain for drinks and dancing (they occasionally host salsa lessons as well)! Planning Tip: First time in the area? Book a tour like this one to get some insider knowledge of the history of the area and get some tasty treats along the way. Figure out the best time to visit

"The best things in Washington, DC with kids",https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/washington-dc-with-kids,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/GettyImages-1421062108.jpeg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 9, 2024","All the insider tips on how to make the most of a family trip to Washington, DC, whether you're traveling with toddlers or teens.","America's capital city is a fantastic destination to visit with children in tow. It's filled with kid-friendly museums, has an abundance of parks in which younger visitors can burn off excess energy, and a logical, pedestrian-friendly layout (let's not forget that DC was designed to showcase urban planning at its very best).  Here are our top tips for exploring the city with children. As America's first purpose-built city, Washington, DC, is, in many ways, a dream to explore with younger visitors. It's flat with very few hills, and roads and sidewalks are wide, smooth and well-maintained, perfect for parents pushing strollers.  Almost all of DC's top attractions are refreshingly accessible – every Smithsonian Museum has ramps, for example, and most museums and major landmarks will have family-friendly restrooms. Generally, you'll almost always be able to enter with strollers, although the White House, which has some of the tightest restrictions, is one of the few places where strollers are on the banned list.  The large number of gardens and parks means there are endless places for kids to burn off excess energy – the National Mall, for example, has over 20,000 trees and numerous dedicated picnic areas with benches and tables. Thirsty kids (and their parents) are also in luck – most businesses, including restaurants, museums and galleries, will happily top up water bottles, and you'll find public water fountains throughout the city, including 47 on the National Mall alone. A tactical approach to timing can transform your holiday. If you're visiting during August and September (the hottest months of the year), you'll want to avoid spending too much time outside in the late morning and early afternoon. Take advantage of the extended opening times offered by many museums – crowds tend to thin out after 5pm, and the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and the National Gallery of Art are just a few of the institutions that run so-called ""late nights."" Public transport in Washington, DC, is also incredibly accessible, and all train stations have ramps, elevators and extra-wide ticket gates designed with strollers and wheelchairs in mind. All Metro trains have priority seating, usually next to the train's doors. Almost all public buses have ramps, although if you're traveling with a stroller, check the size – most buses, including the DC Circulator buses, won't allow strollers more than 48"" long and 24"" wide.  Getting around DC is easier than you think – here's how At the National Museum of American History, parents can take some time out at the Wegmans Wonderplace in the museum's west wing. This baby and toddler-friendly hangout has a playroom, family restroom and nursing area (complete with nursing pillows). The beautiful Rock Creek Park north of the city center has 1754 acres to explore and plenty of fantastic picnic spots (including several next to waterfalls). Toddlers will love the park's Discovery Room, filled with hands-on exhibits and children's books about wildlife, and many of the trails – including the Edge of the Woods Trail – have been designed with strollers and wheelchairs in mind. The US Botanic Garden, which is free to visit, has a dedicated Children's Garden where younger visitors can help staff care for the various plants, along with a scavenger trail lined with rare plants – kids who spot certain species can get a passport book stamped. A riverboat tour is a great activity for kids, who can tick off the city's famous landmarks as they float along the Potomac. Capitol River Cruises offers a range of sailings, although their 45-minute scenic sightseeing cruise hits all the highlights. Tickets are priced around $25 for adults and $15 for children between three and 12. Kids under three are free. Let's face it: teenagers and tweenagers are prone to occasional protestations of boredom, but we've got the perfect solution for anyone who starts to moan about being ""museumed out.""  For a change of scenery, head across the water to the Mount Vernon estate, the former home of George and Martha Washington. You can explore the main house on guided tours, watch sparks fly in the blacksmith's shop and stop by the estate's working farm (activities here include sheep-shearing lessons and the chance to pet the ridiculously cute Hog Island Sheep). Not only will you learn about the Washington family – you'll also gain insights into the lives of people enslaved on the estate. The estate is 15 miles south of Washington, DC. To get there, take the metro's Yellow Line to Huntington Station before hopping on the Fairfax Connector bus to Mount Vernon. Wannabe James Bonds will love L'Enfant Plaza's International Spy Museum, which is filled with interactive exhibits, including ones that encourage them to take part in their very own undercover mission. Our only gripe is that this is one of the few museums that isn't admission-free. Entry fees vary according to the time of year, but children's tickets start at around $19, while adults' tickets start at around $29. Children aged under six visit for free. This is a two-mile-long reservoir wedged between the Potomac River and the Washington Channel. Teens and tweens can hire a paddle boat (from $38 per hour) and admire landmarks such as the Jefferson Memorial and Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial from the water. These experiences should be on your DC itinerary 
And these incredible experiences won't cost you a thing

The best time to go to Sedona,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-time-to-visit-sedona,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/GettyImages-1875654186.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 9, 2024","If you’re looking for the best time of year to visit Sedona, we've got the perfect month-by-month guide to the weather and the best things to do.","As one of Arizona’s most alluring desert cities, Sedona has long ignited the imagination of adventurers, artists and mystics. Now wine tours and film festivals have added to its eclectic vibe, with natural and cultural worlds coming together.  Sedona’s dramatic landscape features 400 miles of trails that twist among spiky cactuses and lead to vermillion peaks in idiosyncratic shapes (look for Snoopy and the coffee pot). The city is also the epicenter for sacred Indigenous sites, energy vortexes, UFO sightings and a booming spiritual scene. Situated in the Verde Valley’s high desert at 4350ft, Sedona has four distinct seasons, with mostly moderate temperatures year-round. Whether you come for hiking and biking adventures, wine-tasting excursions or luxury escapes at the spa, here’s a guide to the best times to visit Sedona. Spring is sublime in Sedona when warmer temperatures (average highs are in the mid-70s) bring cactus blooms, as well as crowds from within the state escaping southern Arizona’s savage summer heat. April and May are the busiest months in Sedona and hotels can be pricey. Fall weather is similar, but without the masses, giving it an edge when choosing the ideal time for outdoor activities like hiking to vortex sites and biking the red-dirt terrain. Snow in the desert? A few inches fall in Sedona, bringing the rare opportunity to take photos of the red rocks crowned in white. Winters are mild, with average highs up to 60F. Hotel rooms are more affordable, so it’s a great time to rejuvenate at Sedona’s superb resorts. In summer, expect heavy afternoon downpours (along with the spectacle of thunder and lightning), typically in July and August. The leaves of Sedona’s oaks and bigtooth maples change color in fall, adding another layer of splendor to the diverse desert landscape whether wandering through the forests at West Fork Trail or driving the scenic State Route 89A through Oak Creek Canyon. Quiet days and fewer visitors in January means there’s room for contemplating those big swings when teeing off on Sedona’s championship golf courses. Fairways are open year-round, framed by fragrant junipers and surrounded by Sedona’s iconic sculpted sandstone.  Key event: Winter Play Day  Crisp February days are perfect for taking in the year’s first festivals and events. During the Sedona Half Marathon, athletes test their legs and lungs running among the ponderosa pines in Coconino National Forest, while silver-screen devotees can choose from more than 140 documentaries and indie films to watch during the nine-day annual international festival. Key events: Sedona Half Marathon, Sedona International Film Festival  Early spring heralds the start of Sedona’s busy season, with hotel prices starting their upward climb in March. Book accommodations early if you plan to participate in Sedona’s signature mountain bike and yoga festivals. Get out early to explore any of the area’s 200 trails to enjoy an adrenaline rush or slice of solitude in nature without the crowds.  Key events:  Sedona Yoga Festival, Sedona Mountain Bike Festival, Sedona Stumble With sunny days, flawless skies, and pleasant weather, April is a great month to discover Sedona’s artistic side. Stroll among its 80-plus art galleries and shops, and listen to classical and contemporary piano performances. Key events: Sedona Open Studios Tour, Piano on the Rocks International Festival, Verde Valley Birding and Nature Festival  The high desert starts to heat up, signaling cholla and prickly pear cactuses to burst into purple and yellow flowers. In May, Sedona buzzes with activity and hotel prices spike, especially with the city hosting events like its biannual concert series, held every Friday in May (and September). Key events: Verde Valley Wine Festival, Red Dirt Concert Series High temps still only hover around 90 in June, but humidity hasn’t hit yet (that comes during monsoon season) and there’s a slowdown of visitors. That means better rates on rooms and an opportunity to splurge on a stellar stay. The reliably gorgeous days and comfortable nights lure people outside to enjoy free movies in the park under a blanket of stars. Key events: Oak Creek Arts and Crafts Show, Summer Cinema Series  Expect weekend day-trippers escaping “the Valley” (greater Phoenix), where temperatures soar in summer. You won’t have to compete for hotels, but prepare to retreat indoors when sudden monsoons soak Sedona, sometimes bringing dangerous flash floods. Weather won’t deter nature, though: July is peak season for spotting up to seven species of hummingbirds. Key events: Fourth of July Wet Fest, Oak Creek Arts and Crafts Show, Sedona Hummingbird Festival Temperatures wane in August and so do room rates, bringing a beautiful balance to the end of summer. Sedona’s usually packed guided excursions see a drop-off in tourists. It’s the ideal month to curate your own desert adventure. Key event: Fool Me Twice!  Activities ramp up again in early fall, with September heralding the harvest season in the Verde Valley’s vineyards and feted right in Sedona during winefest. Book accommodations and restaurants well ahead of time. Need some chill time after all the partying? Find some solitude during an outdoor yoga session or sunrise hike to one of Sedona’s four energy vortexes. Key events: Sedona Winefest, Earth Medicine Festival, Vortifest, Red Dirt Concert Series Hotel prices and temperatures start to cool off again, but fall festivals – music, painting, crafts – celebrating Sedona’s flourishing arts scene are in full swing, making October one of the best times to visit. Key events: Sedona Plein Air Festival, Red Rocks Oktoberfest, Sedona Arts Festival, Fall Arts & Crafts Fair, Red Rocks Music Festival Sedona is still gorgeous in November, with daytime temperatures in the mid-60s. Visitors can soak up the last warm days touring the backcountry, joining a 5k Thanksgiving run, sampling food truck eats or drifting above the otherworldly landscape on a hot air balloon ride. Key events: Sedona Food Truck Festival, Sedona Turkey Trot Aside from the usual holiday season revelry, December is one of the quietest times to visit Sedona. It’s easier to come by coveted restaurant reservations, find bargain hotels with cozy fireplaces and take romantic strolls on normally busy trails such as Cathedral Rock, and Devil’s Bridge without the crowds. Key events: Festival of Lights, Art at Anthem, Merry Music at the Museum,  Keep planning your trip to Sedona:

"Florence's best neighborhoods for art, food and local life",https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-neighborhoods-in-florence,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/woman-camera-Florence.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 9, 2024","Whether you want to be in the heart of the city, close to good bars and food, or quieter districts, we share the best neighborhoods to stay in in Florence.","Recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1982, the historic center of Florence boasts a vast collection of medieval and Renaissance art and architecture, despite its relatively compact size. Originally bounded by its 14th-century city walls – partially removed during the 19th-century renovation of the city – inner Florence is split in half by the Arno River, which runs under the historic Ponte Vecchio linking the two sides of the city. Each neighborhood is typically centered around a square where markets, religious celebrations and public events once took place in the centuries past. While the tourism industry has transformed the city, bringing in millions of visitors each year and creating an increasingly international atmosphere, Florence’s districts have continued to maintain a distinct identity – each offering the chance to discover a different side of the city’s character.  Here is your guide on how to navigate the Renaissance city. Most of Florence’s globally famous icons are concentrated in the city’s core – the area roughly stretching from Piazza del Duomo to Piazza della Signoria. Topped by Filippo Brunelleschi’s red-tiled dome, the impressive Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore took over 140 years to build, standing as Florence’s main religious structure since the late 15th century. The church’s intricately carved marble facade (added in the 19th century) is a spectacle worth admiring from up close, before or after a visit to the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo, the Cathedral, the Baptistery and Giotto's Bell Tower. It is possible to climb both the Duomo and the Bell Tower for a bird’s eye view of the terracotta-covered Florentine rooftops – this if you’re ready to tackle hundreds of narrow steps to the top. Connecting Piazza del Duomo and Piazza della Signoria is the bustling Via dei Calzaiuoli, one of the city center’s busiest arteries. Short detours lead to Piazza della Repubblica, the contemporary art museum of Palazzo Strozzi, and the medieval buildings housing Dante’s museum.  Once you reach Piazza della Signoria, you’ll find yourself under the shadow of Torre di Arnolfo, the clock tower marking the castle-like Palazzo Vecchio, the city’s center of power for the past seven centuries. This is where the Medici ruled over the city and commissioned projects such as the Uffizi, the galleries found a few steps away once functioned as administrative offices. They now house Florence’s most important art museum. Step inside to admire works by Giotto, Botticelli, Raffaello, Caravaggio, Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo and many more. Traveling on a budget? Find out how with this guide to Florence. Branching out from the Santa Maria Novella railway station, this is Florence’s transport hub. With high-speed trains reaching Florence from most major Italian cities, this is often the first point of contact with the city. Hectic and diverse, the neighborhood is well connected to the major sights in the city – a ten minute walk takes you directly to the Duomo and the central market. The imposing Basilica di Santa Maria Novella – founded by Dominican monks in the 13th century – marks the heart of the neighborhood, facing Museo Novecento across the the square. Take some time to admire the symmetrical facade rich in symbolism designed by Leon Battista Alberti, before entering the church to see works by Giotto, Masaccio and Ghirlandaio. For a change from the Gothic and Renaissance masterpieces, pay a visit to Street Levels Gallery, the first urban art gallery in Florence exhibiting works by many Italian street artists. Easily reached from Florence’s railway station through Via Nazionale, lively San Lorenzo expands around the city’s largest market. Crowded, loud and multicultural, the commercial corner of the city is where you’ll find both mass-produced souvenirs and century-old enotecas standing side by side. The central market’s outdoor area is primarily dedicated to leather goods, while a 19th-century building houses two floors of stalls selling anything from fresh produce to traditional meals. Shopping isn’t all there is to do in San Lorenzo. In this neighborhood, you can trace the history of the Medici family, who ruled over Florence for 300 years leaving an indelible mark on its heritage. The Palazzo Medici Riccardi was the Medici’s first Florentine residence, while in the Cappelle Medicee museum you’ll find the monumental tombs of some of the most prominent members of the dynasty, including those contained in Michelangelo’s spectacular Sagrestia Nuova. The San Marco neighborhood, stretching north of San Lorenzo, is Florence’s university hub. The student population gathers on the staircases of Piazza Santissima Annunziata in the late afternoon and most of the university-managed museums – such as the Giardino dei Semplici botanical garden and the Museum of Natural History – are found in the area. San Marco hosts Michelangelo’s best-known masterpiece – David. Steps away from Piazza San Marco is Galleria dell’Accademia, where the Renaissance icon is exhibited. This is not the only major museum in the area – tour the neighborhood to see the works of Beato Angelico at Museo San Marco and find 15th-century paintings at Museo degli Innocenti.  Food lovers take note: here are the best places to eat in Florence.  Piazza Santa Croce extends under the shadow of the majestic Basilica di Santa Croce designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in the late 13th century and embellished with a neogothic facade by Jewish architect Niccolò Matas in 1863. In June, the square is transformed into a sand arena on the occasion of the Calcio Storico tournament, where Florence’s historic districts compete in a brutal game that blends elements of soccer, rugby, and boxing. At night, Santa Croce becomes a playground for the thousands of exchange students that seasonally populate the neighborhood. Enter pubs like Lion’s Fountain, Kikuya or Red Garter and you’ll hardly hear any Italian spoken. Locals tend to flock to the Sant’Ambrogio area, less than one kilometer from Santa Croce, gathering outside of bars such as Enoteca alla Sosta dei Papi, Art. 17, and I Macci. Sant’Ambrogio is also home to Florence’s oldest market, running since 1873. Visit during the day to stock up on fruit and vegetables or stop for lunch in the food court found inside the market’s covered hall. Jointly referred to as the “Oltrarno” – meaning “on the other side of the Arno” – the neighborhoods of San Frediano and Santo Spirito are dotted with bars, vintage stores, ateliers and restaurants. Starting from the post-war period, many Florentine artisans began moving their workshops in this part of the city, drawn to the Oltrarno due to the area’s cheaper rents. Framers, bookbinders, sculptors, and tailors came to define the character of the historically working-class district. Much has changed over the course of the past couple of decades as both San Frediano and Santo Spirito have been transforming under the pressure of tourism flows as the rest of the city. Yet, despite the visible gentrification, these areas remain dedicated to creativity and crafts. Visit on the second Saturday of the month to find the city’s favorite antiques market in Piazza Santo Spirito, stop at Sbrino for a taste of their artisanal gelato, or come by in the late afternoon for an aperitivo at Volume, MAD, L’Angolino. Explore beyond Florence with this guide to the best day trips. Behind Palazzo Pitti, the last residence of the Medici family, are the Boboli Gardens, one of the pioneering examples of Italian landscape architecture built during the Renaissance, which would eventually influence aristocratic gardens all over Europe. On the eastern side of the Oltrarno, the city climbs up on the San Miniato Hill reaching Piazzale Michelangelo and Basilica di San Miniato al Monte, two prime spots for admiring Florence from from above. As you walk through the paths leading on top of the hill you’ll notice the stark difference with the rest of the city – it’s not a coincidence. Following the unification of Italy in 1861, Florence was named capital of Italy for a brief period of time. A redevelopment project was commissioned to architect Giuseppe Poggi, who took up the responsibility of modernizing the city, adding large avenues for motorized vehicles and monumental squares like those seen in other major European urban centers. To achieve his objective Poggi tore down the ancient city walls found in the San Niccolò district (only the city gate, Torre San Niccolò) still stands; constructed a monumental walkway; and built Piazzale Michelangelo, the terrace overlooking Brunelleschi’s Duomo in one of the highest locations in the city marked by a bronze copy of Michelangelo’s David."
10 fabulous experiences in seductive Sedona,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/top-things-to-do-in-sedona,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/GettyImages-1404718730-cropped.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 9, 2024","In addition to Sedona’s incredible natural wonders, you can look forward to wine tastings, high-desert cuisine, moonlit hikes and more.","It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by Sedona’s staggering scenery and unique vibe. Every rambling trail of the geological wonderland seems to have a backstory that deepens every experience. It’s place that strikes a bold balance: a haven for visitors seeking spiritual enlightenment, or those wanting adrenaline-spiking adventure among the ancient red rocks and swaths of pine forest.  The Arizona city’s location in the high desert adds to its distinctive – and authentic – allure, and cool convergences lie everywhere. Locally produced wines pair well with desert cuisine. Pine forests flank red rocks. And Buddhist shrines and natural-vortex sites crackle with good vibrations. From among such exciting options, here are 10 experiences not to miss in Sedona. Sedona’s natural sacred sites have long been lured those seeking spiritual enlightenment. The area’s history originates with Indigenous people, who consider this land a holy place intended for healing and transformation. Yet it might seem surprising to find a pair of Buddhist stupas – mound-like shrines filled with relics and ritual offerings – erected among the red rocks. Located near Chimney Rock at the base of Thunder Mountain, Amitabha Stupa and Peace Park spreads out across 14 acres of junipers and pinyon pines.   The peace park was created by Kunzang Palyul Choling (KPC), a Buddhist organization and study center with roots in Tibet. The 36ft (11m) Amitabha stupa, built according to principles of sacred architecture and geometry, was completed and consecrated in 2004; a bronze image of its namesake Buddha of Limitless Light is inside the stupa’s faceplate. The 6ft (2m), white Tara Stupa is named for the female Buddha. Practicing Buddhists pray to her for health, longevity and compassion. Anyone can visit this site: the organization emphasizes that it’s a place for “prayer, meditation and the experience of peace,” regardless of one’s faith. While you shouldn’t confuse it with Sonoma, Sedona sits in Central Arizona’s Verde Valley at almost a mile in elevation, making it a great region for grape growing. Downtown, the Art of Wine provides a primer on local wines with by-the-glass offerings. And this range is far-reaching: Bordeaux blends, a single-varietal malbec, the familiar chardonnays and rieslings, plus an Arizona fave, Malvasia Bianca, a fruity white with a floral bouquet. Less than half a mile away is Winery 1912, which features Spanish and Iberian varietals grown at Dragoon Mountain Vineyard in the town of Willcox, one of Arizona’s three unique American Viticultural Areas (AVA) (the other two are nearby Verde Valley and Sonoita, south of Tucson).  Winemaking isn’t new to Arizona (Jesuit priests first planted grapes here in the 1690s) – or even to this desert city. Back in the 1880s, when Sedona was a budding village, a homesteader planted grape vines in the high-desert grasslands, where the combination of warm days and cool nights create favorable growing conditions. Sedona today is once again leaning into these agricultural roots, and a number of companies now offer tours to wineries along the Verde Valley Wine Trail. Planning tip: Skip the driving and learn as you sip. Sip Sedona Wine Tours offers customized excursions led by a wine-industry professional, while Wine Tours of Sedona has a range of fun tours, including a date night for two at one of the area’s estate vineyards.   Featuring such evocative shapes as cathedrals, castles, bells – and even Snoopy reclining on his doghouse – Sedona’s landscape is like a city carved out of sandstone. The sheer diversity of these red-rock formations is a draw for photographers (pros and Instagrammers alike), with bright-blue skies providing contrast to the iron-rich rock and dark-green junipers that frame undulating trails.  The desert’s drama softens in spring (late April through June) when delicate fuchsia and yellow flowers bloom from the paddles of prickly pears and branches of cholla cactuses, lending color and whimsy to these spiky plants. Visit in winter and you might witness a veil of snowy white to the ancient peaks.  Walking through the desert in the coolness of the evening when it’s aglow with moonlight puts a fresh spin on exploring Sedona’s terrain. You don’t need to wander alone to watch the last light of the day burn out as the moon makes its ascent: naturalists at Red Rock State Park offer guided interpretive hikes during the full moon. The tour covers two miles and you’ll learn about Sedona’s fascinating geology, history and plant life. “Southwestern” food is one of those all-encompassing terms that can describe multitudes. In Sedona, though, you’ll sometimes see the term “high-desert cuisine” on menus – with rattlesnake as an extreme example, alongside tamer examples like peach cobbler. Syrups made from agave plants and the ripe fruits of prickly pear (or “tuna”) cactus make welcome additions to cocktails, especially margaritas. The pads of those same cactuses, called nopales, turn up in a salad at award-winning Elote Café, and you’ll often find them sizzled up like fries, such as at Cowboy Club. Local tip: Linger at Cowboy Club to soak in some Hollywood history. Back in the day, celebrities like Elvis Presley, Joan Crawford, John Wayne and Rock Hudson hung out here, often when working on the Westerns filmed in the area during the 1950s and ’60s. Imagine the feeling of weightlessness and 360-degree views while drifting above Sedona’s buttes, mesas and pinnacles as the sun slowly climbs, bathing the red rocks in light. A hot-air-balloon ride offers an awe-inspiring way to get oriented to the sprawling landscape. Flights take off early, when the wind conditions are most favorable, and last for up to four hours. What’s more, this mode of exploration is a more environmentally sound way to see Sedona from above. In an effort to enhance the city’s natural peace and quiet as part of its Sustainable Tourism Plan, the city of Sedona has asked helicopter tour operators to adhere to no-fly zones.  Planning tip: Tour operators such as Northern Light Balloon Expeditions and Red Rock Balloon Adventures provide year-round sunrise trips (the latter has some closures in summer), so check the schedule before you travel if you have your heart set on a flight. The two million acres of national forest land and 200 trails traversing 400 miles in Sedona means the potential for riding single-track routes is boundless. People new to mountain biking can find plenty of wider and less-steep routes to get comfortable in the saddle, including parts of Slim Shady and the Bell Rock trail. Advanced riders might want to take on the Hangover trail or Cathedral Rock Big Loop, which gains 1054ft (321m) in elevation. With Sedona’s mild weather, you can go mountain biking any time. (Be aware that heavy rainfall can create flash floods during the summer monsoon season.) Cyclists will enjoy visiting in March, for the three-day Sedona Mountain Bike Festival. Local tip: Remember to never “bust the crust.” These signs on Sedona’s multi-use trails are reminders of the fragility of the desert ecosystem – and to stick to the pathways. Indigenous people first settled in the fertile Verde Valley as far back as 650 BCE: first the Sinagua, followed by the Hopi, Yavapai and Apache. You can discover these cultures’ histories at Arizona’s national parks, and monuments and historic sites run by the US Forest Services, including Palatki, Honanki and Crane Petroglyph (formerly called V Bar V). At these living archeological sites, you can take a guided tour along unpaved pathways to see cave dwellings carved out of the sandstone, and discover the difference between petroglyphs and rock art. Before you go, brush up on your archeological site etiquette. Another way to learn about Sedona’s thriving Indigenous culture is by – yes – shopping. Fine arts and crafts are for sale at a handful of top-quality galleries and boutiques, such as Sedona Artist Market & Gallery, Hoel’s Indian Shop and Garland’s, where staff are generous with their time and knowledge. Every vintage blanket, squash-blossom necklace and sand painting has a fascinating story of culture and craftsmanship passed down through generations. Local tip: Shop carefully to make sure you’re purchasing truly Indigenous-made artifacts rather than knockoffs.  It’s not unusual to find a swimming hole near a clear creek – but one with a natural slide? To skim down an 80ft (24m) sandstone chute into Oak Creek, grab your gear and head to Slide Rock State Park. The park’s stone channel has a seven-percent decline and gets its slickness from algae, which helps slingshot swimmers into the creek’s cool water.  Local tip: With half a mile of the creek to splash around in, wildlife clusters in Slide Rock in summer. Think more than 140 bird species (look for hummingbirds and Steller’s jays), javelinas (aka “skunk pigs”), Coues (pronounced “cows”) white-tailed deer and even black bears. With billionaires blasting off to explore space, would it be such a stretch to think that aliens are visiting us, too? Not in Sedona, which is considered a superb place to see otherworldly aircraft. First off, it’s ultra-dark in Sedona (Oak Creek Village is on the roster of International Dark Sky Places), so it’s easier to pinpoint potential extraterrestrial activity pulsating in those clear, jet-black skies. Second, people believe Sedona has four vortexes – natural sites that emanate a type of energy.  Sedona’s metaphysical community offers a number of educational tours that typically combine UFO sightings (many guarantee you’ll see paranormal activity) and vortex visits; you can only imagine what you might make out when staring at the stars while wearing military-grade night-vision goggles. Regardless of whether you’re a believer yourself, you’ll find out why so many people believe Sedona is such a mystical place.  When should you go? These are the best times to go

Cinque Terre: a first-timer’s guide,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/planning-visit-cinque-terre,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-04/GettyImages-1127950874.jpeg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 8, 2024",The five fishing villages of the Cinque Terre are the Italian Riviera's most iconic highlights. Here's our guide to making the most of your trip there.,"So pretty that it inspired a Disney movie (Luca), Cinque Terre (""five lands"") consists of five startlingly photogenic fishing villages on Italy's northwest coast, their candy-colored houses stacked down the sides of ravines and on top of cliffs. With sea, great food and wine, jaw-dropping views and photo opportunities at every turn, this is everything people love about Italy. Today, however, that beauty is also its curse – it's one of the most overtouristed parts of the Bel Paese, with thousands of daytrippers crowding into the narrow streets, eager to take a couple of quick shots for the 'Gram and then leave. Is Cinque Terre overcrowded? Absolutely. Does that limit your enjoyment? Not if you take your time. Most people day-trip around the five villages, but stay longer – even three or four days – and you'll get a real appreciation of this extraordinary landscape. One of the most remote parts of Italy – the single road arrived in the 1960s, and the railway a century earlier – Cinque Terre has always been a place of visceral beauty. Look up beyond those colored houses: for over 1,000 years, the residents have terraced the cliff sides and cultivated olives and wine that were once the toast of Europe's top tables. Today, the entire area is a national park that celebrates human ingenuity as well as Mother Nature, with around 120km (75mi) of footpaths allowing you to explore it in the raw. But as well as a place to walk, this is also a place to relax. Watch the waves beat against the rocks from one of the medieval castles scattered along the coast – a hallmark of Liguria, the wider region. Drink a glass of wine cultivated on those very cliffs. Watch the sunset set the sea aflame. And rejoice that you chose more than a day trip.  This guide to Cinque Terre shows you how to make the best of your trip to this bucket-list Italian destination. Want more Italian seaside fun? Head to these beautiful beaches Vibes: The southernmost village packs fine-dining restaurants and good bars into its teeny terraces. If you're wondering where to start in Cinque Terre, this is your best bet. See: Castello di Riomaggiore, the clifftop castle overlooking the village Eat: In the mornings or for lunch on the run, grab a pastry or piece of focaccia at Panificio Rosi. The best views in town are from A Pié de Ma, a superb wine bar and restaurant on the cliffs that has an unbeatable selection of local wines by the glass. Run by Sicilian brothers, La Lampara is a superb seafood restaurant. Stay: Locanda Ca da Iride has simple, comfortable rooms (but no breakfast) in the higher part of the village. Vibes: Arguably the prettiest part of Cinque Terre, cutesy Manarola has cottages stacked up and over the cliffs, as well as the area's loveliest main street, which spirals down a canyon to the water's edge. See: Take the footpath forking upwards from the north side of the village to find yourself immersed in cliffside vineyards with spectacular sea views. Eat: From breakfast to late lunches, Cappun Magru is the place for exceptional sandwiches, pastries and cakes, all washed down with local wine. You can't beat Nessun Dorma for an aperitivo with a view – it's jammed onto the cliffside and delivers sunset views. Da Aristide is a lovely family-run restaurant in the heart of the village. Try the muscoli ripieni – mussels stuffed with mortadella, parmesan and egg by nonna Grazia. Stay: Posidonia is a sweet guesthouse with wonderful owners in the quiet, higher part of the village. Vibes: Tiny Corniglia, perched high above the seas, is the only clifftop village in the region. From up here, you can see all of Cinque Terre. See: Take in the views as you climb (or, easier, descend) the 383 steps between the sea-level train station and the village. Eat: Dai Luca offers panini, foccacia and street food for snacks or meals on the run, while the wine bar Terra Rossa has a lovely selection of local dishes and drinks overlooking a pretty garden. A Cantina de Mananan is a lovely osteria (cafe) in the village serving the best Cinque Terre ingredients. Stay: Il Carugio di Corniglia has rooms and apartments overlooking the sea.  Vibes: The busiest village, Vernazza was the most important in the past – though it's crowded, head up the steep staircases to quiet medieval alleyways – as twisty and atmospheric as the caruggi of regional capital Genoa. See: Wander round the small harbor and step into the atmospheric 13th-century church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochia. Eat: Top breakfast spot Il Pirata delle Cinque Terre has Sicilian granita and pastries in the morning, as well as excellent lunch and dinner. Grab a snack or pasta box at Pippo a Vernazza and wash it down with a wine tasting at nearby Cantina Cheo. Ristorante La Torre has spectacular views of the sea (though it's a hike to get there). Stay: Restaurant Gianni Franzi also has rooms scattered throughout the village, most of which have spectacular sea views. Vibes: With its long, sandy beach, this – usually known as plain ""Monterosso"" – is the largest village and the one that most resembles a regular beach resort. See: Wander through the warren of the old town and head up to the humbug-striped Convento dei Cappuccini to see a Crucifixion by Van Dyck. Eat: Start the day with pastries from Pasticceria Laura; to go all out, try the torta monterossina, stuffed with jam and chocolate. You could spend a whole day at Buranco – an agriturismo, vineyard and restaurant just outside the center. Take a bottle for a wander round the vineyard, then settle down to a superb home-cooked lunch. Local legend Miky Ristorante has been a must-visit since 1980. Stay: Friendly Hotel Marina is near Buranco, just outside the historic center of the village. Like the rest of Liguria, Cinque Terre enjoys beautiful, not-too-hot summers. Unlike nearby resorts along the Italian Riviera, however, this isn't really somewhere to flop on a beach – not least because Monterosso has the only real beach, with sand and small pebbles. The other villages either have rocky coves, boulders doubling as diving boards or harbors to swim in. Since most visitors come for an active trip with plenty of hiking, spring and fall are a better bet. Crowded throughout the year – unbearably so in summer – the area is quieter in winter, though it's not always possible to hike due to the weather. Cross-reference your dates with Italian public holidays, as the villages can be impossibly busy with daytrippers. Italian locals share their favorite places to avoid the crowds on vacation The vast majority of visitors come here for a day trip, and while it's possible to visit all five villages in a day, to do so is to completely miss the beauty of the area. Rather like Venice, Cinque Terre is so popular, and so crowded, that if you just have a quick glimpse, you're likely to end up disappointed. Instead, you probably need at least three or four full days in Cinque Terre to get a true taste. That gives you time to see the villages, walk some of the Sentiero Azzurro paths, sit back with some of the local wine as you take in the views, and even visit some of the villages further up the cliff sides. Spend a week, and you can add lesser-known hikes and visit some of Italy's most spectacular vineyards. Even longer is better – I spent two weeks on my first trip and enjoyed every minute. This is a relatively tough-to-reach location, which makes it even more important to spend as long as you can here. The closest airports are Genoa and Pisa – both are around 1-2 hours by train from Cinque Terre, depending on connections. One extremely important point: driving here is absolutely to be avoided. Parking is extremely limited, expensive, and usually a long, steep climb outside the villages (only residents are allowed to park inside). The narrow, clifftop roads can also be frightening for newcomers to the area – the Amalfi Coast has nothing on these lanes, and even as a seasoned Italian cliffside driver, one time in Cinque Terre was one time too many for me. Even if you already have a car on your trip, it's best parking outside Cinque Terre (try La Spezia or Levanto) and coming in on the train. You have my word on this. The best way to travel between the villages is definitely by rail. Trains run around every 15-20 minutes throughout the day, stopping at each of the five villages – the journey time between each stop is only a couple of minutes. Tickets cost €5-10 per journey (even if you're just doing a two-minute hop) depending on the season, and it's often better value to buy a timed Cinque Terre Card, which allows unlimited train travel between Levanto and La Spezia (the cities north and south of the area). The card also includes hiking fees, as well as bus travel to the more remote villages. Proceeds go to the national park. You can also get around by boat. Navigazione Golfo dei Poeti runs between La Spezia and Levanto, calling at all the villages. Golfo Paradiso has a line from Genoa. Services can be suspended in bad weather, however, and boarding with a lot of luggage can be tricky.  In the villages themselves, the only real option is walking – and they are steep. Those with mobility issues will certainly find it difficult. The centers of Corniglia and Vernazza are largely flat, as is the beach area of Monterosso. Manarola and Riomaggiore are trickier for anyone with mobility issues. The most famous of Cinque Terre's paths is the Sentiero Azzurro (Blue Trail), which links all five villages across the cliff sides (it's marked as SVA on maps). In recent years, it's been rare that you'll find it fully open – winter storm damage means that some long stretches are closed. The easiest stretch – which is actually more of a moderate level – is Corniglia to Vernazza (2.5 miles, with a steep downhill section at the end). To get updates on closures, check the national park website before you head out. Take a boat with Navigazione Golfo dei Poeti to see Cinque Terre's extraordinary landscape from the sea. It gives you an idea of the remoteness of the place – there wasn't a road here until the 1960s – and of how the locals have sculpted terraces from the sheer cliffs, making an uninhabitable landscape productive. Docking at the villages' tiny harbors is a memorable experience, and you can go onwards to La Spezia or (my pick) Levanto. Cinque Terre's most famous walk has always been the Via dell'Amore – the flat, accessible, 1km (half-mile) path between Riomaggiore and Manarola. Closed since 2012 due to landslide damage, it's due to reopen in July 2024 for guided tours only. I got a sneak peek last year and was impressed – the tours explain the rich history of the area and make you look beyond those color-popping houses. For centuries, Cinque Terre has been known for its wine: sea-flecked salty whites grown along the cliffs. Try it by the glass at bars like A Pié de Ma in Riomaggiore or Cappun Magru in Manarola – both of these offer wine flights and tastings. Time for more wine: for me, nothing tells you more about Cinque Terre than perching high up in the hills, hearing how the locals have produced bottles that, in the Renaissance period, were so famous that they graced the tables of kings and popes. Tilling those cliffsides is backbreaking manual work, and while the vineyards are a fraction of what they were, they're important for stabilizing the increasingly fragile landscape and warding off the effects of climate change.  The best – and most fun – way to understand this is with a vineyard tour. You'll catch me high up on the hills above Vernazza on a tour from Cheo – from the vineyards, there are jaw-dropper views of the village, castle and sea below. Don't forget to try the heavenly sweet sciacchetrà wine that Cinque Terre is famous for – that sea-salt breeze adds an incredible tang. Cinque Terre is expensive by Italian standards – visit in the high season or on a weekend, and you can expect to see prices double. Accommodation is particularly expensive in relation to the quality of what's on offer – there are very few hotels here, and usually your best bet is an affittacamere – room rental without breakfast. Accommodation in La Spezia or Levanto is usually cheaper and less problematic in terms of homeowners turfing out local renters to create Airbnbs, a major issue in the villages. Having said that, Cinque Terre's magic is especially strong at night. You won't find any bargain restaurants or trattorias – prices are up there with high-end joints in major cities – but on the plus side, Liguria is the home of Italian street food, and there are plenty of small bakeries offering tasty snacks like focaccia that are good for lunch.  Average daily cost for: Weather changes fast on the Liguria coast, and even in the hottest summer months, you'll probably need a jacket or sweater at night – as well as if you go out on a boat during the day. Don't underestimate how challenging the villages can be for those with mobility problems. Even if you're not planning to hike, Manarola and Riomaggiore are extremely steep. Be aware of that when you book your accommodation, too – there are limited porter services, and you should be prepared to cart your luggage up the cliffside. Village hop without counting the cost. The card includes access to all the hiking trails and allows you onto the bus routes to villages higher up on the cliffs. The proceeds go to the national park. Levanto and La Spezia bookend Cinque Terre and are included in Cinque Terre train tickets, so if you're booking last minute and the villages are sold out, try here (I prefer Levanto – La Spezia is a bigger city). Like all overtouristed areas, Cinque Terre's future depends on how tourists treat it. Shop at local artisan shops for souvenirs and eat at restaurants that utilize local products like marinated anchovies and regional wine. The latter is an important one – young locals replanting vineyards are helping to stabilize the fragile cliff terraces. Cinque Terre's footpaths are so famous that you can often feel cushioned against nature, but these are vertiginous, cliffside trails that at times are lethally narrow. Always stop to take a photo, rather than walking with your camera, to avoid missteps. Wear decent shoes (flip flops are banned and there are checks at the trailheads) and bring plenty of water, as there's very little shade. Always stick to the designated path – this is an exceptionally fragile environment. And, of course, don't litter."
5 of the best neighborhoods to explore in Dublin,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-neighborhoods-in-dublin,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/GettyImages-1210627020.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 8, 2024",Get to know Dublin one neighborhood at a time with this guide.,"Dublin is Ireland's largest and liveliest city, with neighborhoods that have little intricacies and quirks to uncover during your visit. It's also easy to get around on foot or by bike, so you'll have no problem seeing the best the city has to offer wherever you base yourself. Everything in Dublin starts from the meandering mid-point that is the River Liffey, which splits the city into north and south zones. All the odd-numbered postal districts are on the Northside while the even-numbered districts are on the Southside. Sometimes wider areas can just be referred to by their number (ie Dublin 7, Dublin 8) so this can be handy information to help orientate yourself. Whether you're here for the history, the culture or the craic, here’s a rundown of some of the best neighborhoods in Dublin for your next stay.  Choose 3, 4, 5, or 7 top Dublin attractions and enjoy great savings with Go City. Taste the world-famous Irish drink at Guinness Storehouse, enjoy the sights on Big Bus Dublin Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour, or discover Dublinʼs oldest building, Christ Church Cathedral - the choice is yours! Best for gay culture, great food and good pubs Where working-class Dubliners share streets with hipster newcomers, Stoneybatter in Dublin 7 has become the ""gayborhood"" of Dublin (though there's a rival claim from the larger Dublin 8 district on the other side of the river). In the heart of the neighborhood, Carnew St is a bit of a destination in itself for travelers of a certain age, famed as a filming location for the Spice Girls’ Stop music video. You may spot super fans making the pilgrimage here to snap a selfie, while others gaze on with puzzled expressions. It’s a great place for food: the postcard-perfect provisions spot Lilliput Stores should be your first stop, followed by a trip to Joli for oat-milk flat whites and epic sausage rolls. Book brunch at Slice and dinner at Grano, Ramen Co or the bustling L Mulligan Grocer. Finish by stopping by any one of the agreeable local pubs in the area. Top picks include the Belfry, the Glimmer Man and Walshs – a particularly handsome Victorian pub retaining many traditional features and offering one of the best ""snugs"" in the city.

The best time to go to Bangkok,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-time-to-visit-bangkok,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2021-03/GettyRF_890003986.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 8, 2024","With three seasons – hot, rainy and (comparatively) cool – Bangkok offers very different experiences throughout the year. Here's the best time to visit.","It used to be that Bangkok’s weather was defined by three clearly demarcated seasons: the “cool,” the hot, and the wet, but these days locals like to joke that there is only hot, hotter and hottest. While it may be true that the Thai capital runs on a sultry high-flame sizzle most days, there are definitely seasonal differences, as well as compelling reasons to visit year round. You’re never going to have to worry about it being cold here, and if you like to travel with just shorts and t-shirts, you’ll be in your element, but your ability (or not) to handle the hot season heat or the high season crowds might influence just when you plan your visit. Here’s a breakdown of the three different Thailand seasons and how each can be best for planning a trip to Bangkok.  November marks the start of both Bangkok’s most comfortable weather as well as tourist high season, which runs until the end of February. While some refer to this period as the “cool” season, note that this is just a relative term. Temperatures still will be close to 30°C (86°F) or higher and there will be plenty of sunshine, while evenings can be quite pleasant, with lots of outdoor beer gardens opening up with no need for air conditioning. During this time you’ll even get a few cold snaps where the temperature will drop to 20°C (68°F) and all the locals will be bundled in down jackets and other winter-associated garb! This is also the one time of year when you have a chance to go sightseeing without being drenched in perspiration.  Not only is this the most pleasant time of year weather-wise, it’s also a season of some of the top Thai holidays, like Loy Krathong, when everyone floats illuminated banana-leaf boats on the canals and Chao Phraya River. Loy Krathong is held during the November full moon, and is followed up by the large Christmas and New Year festivities. While not traditionally Thai, all the shopping malls are decorated with large trees and there are countless shopping sales and restaurant holiday promotions. All the holiday energy is capped off by a massive New Year’s Eve celebration that features fireworks across the city, buzzing outdoor beer gardens and countdown parties. Towards the end of this season is Chinese New Year, usually taking place in February, where you can see traditional Chinese opera performances and watch the streets of Chinatown come to life with fantastic food, dragon parades and other colorful happenings.  While the weather at this time of year may be the ideal winter escape, you’ll be in fierce competition with plenty of other sun worshippers, as this is considered high season in Thailand. Hotels will be at a premium and often need to be booked well in advance, especially around Christmas, New Year and Chinese New Year. Tourist attractions and shopping malls will be packed, and all of the nearby beach escapes such as Pattaya or Ko Samet will be overrun. One pleasant exception to this is that during the days leading up to and after New Year, Bangkok empties out, with most people returning home or going on vacation for a week, meaning that you’ll get to experience the capital without gridlock, taxi queues or the usual crowds. The beginning of March marks the start of the hot and dry season in Bangkok. It almost never rains during this stretch and temperatures soar, in recent years staying above 40°C (104°F) for prolonged stretches. It’s a challenging time to be sightseeing and traveling, although visiting from March to May does have some rewards. This is tourist low season, with far fewer visitors than at other times of year. If you’re into shopping and elegant stays, this can be an excellent time to come, as you’ll find plenty of ice-cold air conditioning in all the malls, hotels, and skytrain, plus some great promotions on accommodation.  Coming here in mid-April (13-15) also means you can experience Songkran, the Thai New Year and world’s biggest water fight, where everyone takes to the street for a large water carnival. Wear some old clothes, wrap your wallet and cellphone in plastic, buy a squirt gun, and go out and join the fun. It’s another way to beat the heat and see Bangkok at its best. While Songkran accommodation reservations need to be made well in advance, you can pretty much just show up and still find great deals for the rest of the hot season, one of the perks of traveling during the heat. While the temperatures drop back down far below the April-May sizzle, the humidity goes up, so it can be pretty sticky. On the plus side, the rainstorms clean out the smoggy Bangkok air, and this can be the least-polluted time of year to experience the capital. As this is the summer for Europeans and North Americans, there will be more tourists than during the hot season, but nowhere near the crowds of November to February, and you’ll still be able to find great deals on hotels and travel, especially at nearby beach resorts like Hua Hin or Pattaya. While the initial onset of the monsoon season tends to see short heavy rains, the end of the monsoon is when it gets really wet. September and October are the rainiest months in Bangkok, the only time when you will really see some days when it rains consistently or all day long. The area around the Chao Phraya River is often flooded, although hotels and restaurants put up sandbags to mitigate the damage and assist guests with getting in and out, but prepare for traffic to be at full gridlock and you’ll need an umbrella with you throughout your stay. On the plus side, if you don’t mind the wet you’ll be here at the quietest time of year for tourism, with no need to book in advance and plenty of deals to entice, which is great for budget travelers. Older travelers may appreciate this season, as September marks the return to school in Europe and North America, meaning less young visitors in Thailand. Additionally, there are several really excellent festivals in September and October; the Vegetarian Festival, a 9-day celebration where people refrain from meat-eating, wear white and throng the Chinatown temples where there are opera performances, parades and plenty of vegetarian food, followed by the Moon or Mid-Autumn festival, where families carry lanterns through Chinatown and exchange mooncakes. Despite the rain, for many visitors, the cleaner air, green countryside and few tourists makes this the optimal time of year to plan a trip to Bangkok.
