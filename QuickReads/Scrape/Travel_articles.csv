With so much to see, we've put together our favorite Met itineraries – whether you're here for one, three or eight hours. Best indoor-outdoor experience Recognized as one of the most significant modern art museums on the planet, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is an absolute must-visit. Galleries sprawl across multiple levels and the five-story central atrium means a bird's-eye balcony view from every floor. Sound installations in the atrium can be heard throughout the museum, creating a cacophonous, immersive experience. Best of all is the outdoor sculpture garden, accessible only from within the museum, with a floor made of polished marble and a rotating array of sculptures from such greats as Aristide Maillol, Rachel Whiteread, Henri Mattise and Pablo Picasso. Best for Asian and Eurasian art This museum in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood is a true original. Come for an experience dedicated exclusively to the art of Eurasia, Central Asia, India and the Himalayas. The Himalayan collection at the Rubin has a heavy focus on Tibetan culture and includes thangkas (cloth paintings), votive objects, statues and more. The museum is free every Friday evening between 6pm and 10pm but you'll need to book a ticket in advance – a live DJ and drinks make it a great start to your evening. Even if you've been before, it's worth a return trip to see the immersive installations that are periodically on display. The recent highlight is the Tibetan shrine room perfect for contemplation, complete with flickering candles and the soothing lull of chanting from Tibetan nuns and monks. Best for a downtown adventure This excellent museum is perfectly located for a culture fix while exploring the West Village, Meatpacking District, High Line and Hudson River Park neighborhoods. Known locally as The Whitney, this museum’s phenomenal permanent art collection covers American creativity from the late 19th century through to the present day. You'll find everything from painting and sculpture to photos and video artworks, alongside eclectic multimedia installations. The museum prides itself on showcasing living artists, giving the galleries a fresh and ultra-contemporary feel. Admission is free on Friday evenings and the second Sunday of every month, making for a great, inexpensive way to explore the collections. Best for medieval art For medieval history buffs, the Met Cloisters – fondly referred to simply as “The Cloisters” – is a unique treat. The museum has a wonderful assortment of ancient objects on display, including hand-carved wooden panels, perfectly preserved stone sepulchers and elegantly woven tapestries that come to life on every wall. While you're here, pop into nearby Fort Tryon Park for gorgeous river views from one of the highest points in the city. Best LGBTIQ+ art museum This cozy neighborhood gallery in Manhattan’s Soho is lesser-known but it packs an impressive cultural punch. Covering more than 22,000 works by historic and contemporary LGBTIQ+ artists, its collection is nothing short of legendary. Items include contributions from iconic queer artists ranging from Andy Warhol and Robert Mapplethorpe to David Hockney and Berenice Abbott and hundreds more in between. Located on a quiet cobblestoned street, this outwardly unassuming museum is an important community builder and an outstanding collection all in one. Best for families This engaging space has something for anyone with an interest in the natural world, but it's particularly good for families with kids. Adults will marvel right alongside teens and toddlers at the displays of skeletal dinosaurs and other natural wonders in this massive, 2-million-square-foot museum, which also includes a stellar planetarium and an extensive library. A 200-strong team of scientists is behind the informative displays. Its impressive manifesto says it all: “To discover, interpret, disseminate – through scientific research and education – knowledge about human cultures, the natural world, and the universe.” Admission is “pay as you wish” for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut residents, which makes a visit affordable for families on a budget. For more insider tips on things to do with your kids in NYC, dive into our family guide to the Big Apple.

701,"12 free things to do in Sedona, Arizona",https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/free-things-to-do-in-sedona,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2021-08/shutterstock_767624740.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 11, 2024","If you’re looking to experience Sedona on a budget, here are 12 free things to do.","Sedona is celebrated for being a luxury haven in Arizona, satisfying the senses with elegant resorts, rejuvenating spas and superb restaurants that blend beautifully into the natural surroundings. Not everything worth seeking out is expensive, which can help you keep your budget in balance after indulging in awe-inspiring experiences like drifting over the desert in a hot-air balloon and bouncing through the backcountry on a Jeep tour. Regardless of the reason, here are 12 free things to do in Sedona. Take advantage of fee-free days at important heritage destinations run by the US Forest Service: Palatki, Honanki and Crane Petroglyph (formerly called V Bar V), which is Verde Valley’s largest known site of its kind. Park rangers lead tours, deciphering cryptic paintings and markings etched in the stone and providing intel on the prehistoric cultures and people who originally lived in what’s now the Coconino National Forest near Sedona.  Gaze up at sandstone cliff dwellings built by the Sinagua peoples and imagine how they existed in this otherworldly landscape, estimated to be between 1150–1350 CE. Get a glimpse into their lives, from the wild plants they ate and deer and rabbits they hunted for sustenance to the tools they fashioned from wood and stone.  Planning tips: You must make a reservation to visit Palatki and Honanki. All three sites are subject to closures during extreme temperatures in summer, as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas days. Dogs are not allowed. At night, Sedona gets dark – like, really dark. Sedona’s clear skies and dark nights are ideal for getting a glimpse of Mercury rising or spotting Orion’s Belt. As an international dark sky community, the city keeps light pollution to a minimum. That makes it easy to find a pitch-black place, let your eyes adjust and see what glitters or glows. The city also has a reputation for UFO sightings, and astronomy tourism is big here.  If you’re hitting the desert trails at night, remember to bring a flashlight; you might even spot some scorpions. Take your stargazing to the next level to see deep-sky objects – star clusters, nebulas and galaxies – by hooking up with the Sirius Lookers, a local amateur astronomy club.  Planning tip: Save the daily $5 parking fee at popular trails by heading off the beaten path to places like the Jordan Road Trailhead at the end of West Park Ridge Drive.  The upper regions of the Sonoran Desert – where Sedona is situated – supports a surprising amount of wildlife such as javelina, coyotes, mule deer, black-tailed rattlesnakes, tarantulas and a ton of lizards. And the 27-acre Sedona Wetlands Preserve is probably the best place to go birding.  The Northern Arizona Audubon Society offers free seasonal field trips here to see hundreds of birds in their natural habitat. Find solitude on the trails while watching for skittish Gambel’s quail, leggy herons and an array of raptors: osprey, turkey vultures and even bald eagles.  Planning tip: Visit the Northern Arizona Audubon Society website for a list of walking tour dates. With more than 80 galleries, Sedona showcases a multitude of art mediums, from photography and painting to glass-blowing and sculpture. On the first Friday of each month, select members of the Sedona Gallery Association host art exhibits, events, and receptions (with refreshments), inviting guests to discover Sedona’s art scene. Planning tip: The art reception locations change each Friday and they're are scattered among Sedona’s neighborhoods, so check the website ahead of time to see what’s featured. Sedona's dark skies make for a perfect backdrop for outdoor movie nights; free, family-friendly films (classics from the 1970s and late 2000s) are hosted at the Posse Grounds Pavilion every Friday night in June. It’s part of the City of Sedona’s annual Summer Cinema Series, which brings locals and visitors together to enjoy a community event in the great outdoors. Planning tips: Get comfy: bring your own chair and blanket, plus snacks and beverages. Alcohol is not permitted and neither are pets, except service ADA dogs. Sedona is surrounded by natural splendor, but driving the Red Rock Scenic Byway (State Route 179) lets newcomers get acquainted with the sandstone formations towering right over the road. Driving through the Village of Oak Creek, you can’t miss the iconic Bell Rock, which rises almost 5000ft, and its neighboring Courthouse Butte, which stands even higher. The scenic route continues north to another landmark edifice, the Chapel of the Holy Cross (see below), a church built right into the cliff. For a peaceful place to meditate, pray, or walk a medicine wheel in the desert, head to Amitabha Stupa and Peace Park. Situated in West Sedona, this spiritual spot sits among the pines and junipers against a backdrop of Chimney Rock and Thunder Mountain (also called Capitol Butte). Take time exploring here: spin the prayer wheels next to the 36ft Amitabha Stupa, take a side trail to the gleaming white 6ft Tara Stupa, named for the female deity, and pause at the mahogany statue of Shakyamuni Buddha, on the pathway behind the Buddha to get to the medicine wheel.  The park’s grounds are also considered a sacred Indigenous site, which features a wheel composed of stones representing the circle of life. There is believed to be a prophecy dating back to the seventh century that connects Tibetan Buddhists and Hopi peoples. Enter at the medicine wheel’s east opening, then continue strolling to the other points in a clockwise direction. Planning tips: Parking is free, but arrive early for a more peaceful experience. Learn more about the park and Buddhism before you visit to best use your time at this sacred site. You won’t find outsize architecture in Sedona, with one exception: the Chapel of the Holy Cross. The Catholic Church, completed in 1956, is situated within the red rock at 1000ft. Both the chapel and its 90ft concrete cross built into the front façade (it functions as both symbol and structural support) are visible from the Red Rock Scenic Byway (State Route 179). Yet thanks to its modernist design, there are no sky-piercing spires or ornate embellishments detracting from its vertiginous position. Peek inside the chapel for a look at the 33ft bronze crucifix commissioned by a local artist, which was installed in 2018.   Planning tip: The last entry to explore inside the chapel is 4:45pm; pets must be left outside. Stretching 79 acres, Posse Grounds Park offers plenty of room to play. As Sedona’s first city park, it’s an established destination with dedicated areas for various sports, from softball and skateboarding to sand volleyball and the ever-popular pickleball. Located in West Sedona, the park’s wide-open spaces are about unwinding with a picnic at one the 10 ramadas or joining the non-stop action: bash the ball around the two tennis courts, shoot some hoops or head to the grassy spot to play bocce ball. There are even mini-parks for practicing bike skills, with a loop here for young kids too.  Spirit seekers, or those just curious about the metaphysical world, can hike to one of Sedona’s vortex sites. These natural areas are said to radiate energy (considered masculine, feminine or a balance of the two) from the earth, drawing people to meditate, practice yoga or engage in other spiritual and wellness activities. Four vortex sites, each accessible by trail, are scattered around Sedona: Bell Rock, Cathedral Rock, Boynton Canyon and Airport Mesa. Some say Chapel Rock is the site of a fifth vortex, but it is less powerful than the others. Planning tip: No car? No problem. Take the Sedona Free Shuttle to get to the Cathedral Rock trailhead; it’s a smart and sustainable way to get to the popular trailheads without worrying about paying for parking or finding a spot. Golden arches at McDonald's? Not in Sedona. The fast-food giant’s recognizable logo isn’t sunshine yellow, but instead a blue-green hue to better blend into the natural landscape. It might seem silly to feature a fast-food sign on this list, but it's the only set of teal arches in the world and it's a testament to Sedona's dedication to blending in with Mother Nature's splendor; the city of Sedona has a Land Development Code that outlines clear standards for preserving the community’s character, which includes the color of signs. Catch a glimpse of the famous sign on your way to the Shelby Trailhead for a morning hike or on your way to Airport Mesa to experience its vortex. There’s always something happening in this living arts community modeled after a Mexican village and named for a city on the outskirts of Guadalajara. Along with being home to an array of artisan boutiques and restaurants, the Tlaquepaque Arts & Shopping Village hosts ongoing activities, from flamenco dancing and ballet folklórico (traditional Mexican dancing) in the courtyard to celebrations for Cinco de Mayo and its signature Festival of Lights, which ramps up during the holidays  Decide when to book your trip The best time to go to Sedona

702,These 5 road trips from Las Vegas will take you far beyond casinos and glitz,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-road-trips-from-las-vegas,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-04/GettyImages-1506078634-cropped.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 10, 2024","After you’ve had your fill of the strip, consider these day trips and multi-day road trips from Las Vegas for adventures in the desert.","In a city filled with the atypical, it’s easy to fall into the typical tourist routine in Las Vegas. The generationally accepted Sin City mantra is to gamble, catch a show, gamble some more, have a few drinks, enjoy a little entertainment…and repeat as many times as humanly possible until you have to stagger back to the airport and catch your flight home. Vegas’ two tourist zones, the Strip or Downtown/Fremont Street, are within a 15-minute drive of one another; if you stay in one, perhaps you’ll make an excursion to the other. And that’s the extent of a “day trip” for most. Yet far too many visit Las Vegas without exploring the top-notch historical, geographical and cultural attractions nearby, many of which are within a three-hour drive. By renting a car, you can coast through the likes of Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire of State Park within 45 minutes (though we recommend taking more time, to explore the orange rock formations in both by hiking). It’s pretty easy to navigate Las Vegas and surrounding areas via generally well-kept and well-paved roadways, with Interstate 15 (running north-south), Clark County Rte 215 (a beltway encircling the city) and a US Rte 95 (a northwest-southeast diagonal) the key roads to know. It’s true that Las Vegas is surrounded by desert, and this arid region doesn’t abound with notable road-trip stops. But quality makes up for quantity, and you’ll find a world of wonder awaits within reach of Sin City: think the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, quirky hotels, national parks…and so much more. Here are three true day trips – plus two additional multi-day options – that will help expand your Las Vegas horizons. Best road trip to do via bus
Las Vegas–Grand Canyon West Skywalk; 125 miles (201km); allow one (long) day The Western Rim of the Grand Canyon (known as Grand Canyon West) is within a two-and-a-half-hour bus ride of Las Vegas. Tour operators like Grand Canyon Destinations, Gray Line and GC Tours pack it all in one day, making early morning pick-ups, allowing three-or-so hours of free time and stopping for optional meals. The “must” at Grand Canyon West is a tip-toe along the cantilevered, glass-bottomed Skywalk.

703,Lonely Plan-it: How to plan a trip to the Colombian rainforest,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/how-to-plan-a-trip-to-colombia-rainforest,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-04/Egerton-Colombia-Rainforest.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 10, 2024",Here’s how to get off the beaten track and discover the best of the magnificent Colombian rainforest.,"Gazing at a map of Colombia, the vast swathes of greenery that make up the roadless Amazon region may seem like one homogenous mass of jungle, but that lack of detail has always drawn me to travel deep into the rainforest. Despite making up 42% of Colombia’s landmass, the sparsely populated Amazonia receives very few visitors.  It spreads over six departments – Amazonas, Vaupes, Guainía, Guaviare, Caqueta and Putumayo– all of which offer intrepid travelers the chance to roll up their trouser legs and wade into a magical world of old-school travel experiences. Moving around here is hot, tiring and requires a lot of planning, but the rewards are immense. From thundering waterfalls in the middle of the jungle to enormous rocks that protrude from the rainforest canopy and cave art featuring the handprints of long-lost civilizations, the Colombian Amazon is both a natural and cultural wonderland. Here’s how to get off the beaten track and discover the best of this magnificent Colombian rainforest. Wet or really wet Needless to say, any destination within the world's biggest rainforest gets its fair share of precipitation regardless of when you go. However the Colombian Amazon does have two marked seasons. The dry season runs from June to November and is scorching hot, but it’s the best time for hiking under the jungle canopy with firm trails and less wetlands to cross.  Low water levels also reveal spectacular golden beaches backed by walls of brilliant green foliage that appear on the banks of many of the region’s major rivers.  The dry season is also great for wildlife watching – both forest and aquatic birds gather around shrinking water sources, butterflies are particularly active within the forest and larger mammals such as tapirs and otters make appearances on river banks. The cooler wet season runs from December to May and sees rivers swell, lowland forests flood and lagoons fill, making it the best time to observe playful pink dolphins. It’s ideal for water-based exploration, whether paddling through flooded forests or venturing out onto mirror-like blackwater lakes. Fly into a regional hub Almost the entirety of the Colombian Amazon remains blanketed in thick rainforest, and settlements are few and far between – choosing the right base for your adventure imperative. Once you leave the limited road network leading into the Amazonia from the base of the Andes, there’s very little transport between towns in the region, with most passengers and goods arriving on direct flights from Bogotá. Visiting several different areas of the Amazon on one trip is difficult. To maximize your time in the jungle, it's best to fly directly to one of the departmental capitals from where you can visit surrounding attractions on shorter boat rides. Major commercial airlines serve Leticia in the southern Amazon, which is a top spot for wildlife watching in nature reserves and on the lakes and tributaries of the mighty Río Amazonas. Less developed destinations are reached with the goverment-run airline Satena and include Puerto Inírida, from where you can travel to the imposing rock formations of the Guayanese Shield and the wide waters of the Río Orinoco. Another option is Mitú, gateway to awe-inspiring waterfalls. If your budget doesn’t allow for long flights and boat rides, you can get a taste of the Amazon in the departments of Guaviare, Caqueta and Putumayo on the western edge of the region, which are all accessible by bus from other major towns in the country. Luxurious lodge or cultural experience? In remote areas, private nature lodges do their best to provide comfort in the jungle with elegant screened huts, good mattresses, satellite internet connections and gourmet meals. Once you book at a lodge, you’ll usually be required to organize all your activities through the hotel which, while easy, does limit flexibility. Another option is to bunk down in a riverside Indigenous community; many have recently turned to tourism as a way to generate employment and keep young people from leaving to the city.  Quality varies greatly: the very best initiatives rival the nature lodges for comfort, while at others, getting a good night’s rest can be a challenge. Staying in a community does have major advantages, however, with visitors free to wander around and experience traditional riverside life. It’s easy to organize hikes and boat trips at your own pace with knowledgeable local guides. Just be aware that residents are often reserved and it’s best to ask before snapping photos. Due to the remote nature of the villages, many are not bookable online before departure, but local tour agencies in hub cities can usually call ahead to lock down a bed. A couple of well-run options can be found at Mocagua near Leticia or El Remanso below the Cerros de Mavecure. From magical mountains to rushing rapids Once on the ground, internet access ranges from very slow to non-existent, so it’s a good idea to research the attractions in the area before setting out.  Having a firm list of your must-sees makes it easier to work with boat operators once you arrive to design a journey that will hit all your selections without doubling back again and again. Here are a few highlights in the region:  Cerros de Mavecure These three enormous ancient rock monoliths rise unexpectedly from the lowland jungle beside the Río Inírida in Guainía. They are some of the oldest rock formations on the continent, and visitors can climb to the top of Cerro Mavecure for 360-degree views across the forest canopy. Estrella Fluvial de Inírida Take a boat ride from Inírida, the capital of Guainia department, to where the different colored waters of the Inírida, Guaviare and Atabapo Rivers flow into the mighty Orinoco, forming one of Colombia’s most important Ramsar wetlands. Raudal de Jirijirimo Perhaps the Colombian Amazon’s most awe-inspiring spectacle, these immense waterfalls on the Río Apaporis in Vaupes department, a 90-minute flight from Bogotá, are surrounded by impenetrable jungle and are only accessible by light aircraft. Lago de Tarapoto Watching pink dolphins jump playfully out of the placid waters of this pristine rainforest lake west of Leticia. It’s one of the Amazon’s most rewarding wildlife-watching experiences. The best time to see these wondrous creatures is in April and May when the lake is at its fullest. Prepare for bugs and wild weather Shops are lightly stocked in the jungle so you’ll want to bring essentials from home. If there’s one group of animals you’re guaranteed to encounter in abundance in the Amazon, it's insects. You’ll need to bring good repellent – 20% picaridin works well – and a portable mosquito net also comes in handy. Lightweight, impermeable clothing is a must. While you’re likely to spend most of your time in the region sweating profusely, it can get unexpectedly cold at night and heavy rains on hikes and boat trips will have unprepared travelers shivering. And if you're carrying electronic devices, you’ll want to bring a spare power pack (many villages don’t have constant electricity), a reliable dry bag (more for the rain than immersion) and some silica gel to soak up humidity for your electronic devices. Personalize your rainforest tour One of the biggest expenses when exploring the Amazon is boat travel. Fuel for outboard motors is bought in from a great distance and is much more expensive than elsewhere in the country. Depending on how far you’re going, expect to spend at least US$200 per day for a motorized canoe. You can organize private boats once you arrive in the region through your accommodations or simply go down to town docks and negotiate with drivers. Local tour operators sometimes organize collective day trips to nearby attractions, especially on weekends, but these tend to be crowded.  A better option is to get together with like-minded travelers and make your own itinerary so that you’re able to spend as long as you like at each stop. The price of a boat is usually the same irrespective of the number of passengers onboard, so it’s worth spending some time seeking out new friends to share the expense.  If you are unable to form a group and are on a tight budget you’ll need plenty of time. The cheapest way to get around is to hang out at the town dock and wait for a local supply boat that’s heading your way - although this may take days to materialize. I have made many trips from my home in the Colombian mountains down to the Amazon and after nearly every journey, I find myself wishing I had allocated more time.  Because I’m usually traveling on a budget, flexibility is key. On countless occasions I have had to pass up the chance to join unplanned trips to incredible destinations due to pre-booked return flights. Buying changeable flights or simply arriving on a one way ticket is a good way to ensure you’re free to go wherever the river takes you."," Gazing at a map of Colombia, the vast swathes of greenery that make up the roadless Amazon region may seem like one homogenous mass of jungle, but that lack of detail has always drawn me to travel deep into the rainforest.

And with historical monuments, natural wonders and roadside attractions sprinkled liberally across the state, Florida is particularly well suited for road-tripping. Here's our pick of the best road trips in the Sunshine State.  Best road trip for springs, manatees and mermaids
Pensacola–Weeki Wachee; 510 miles; 5–7 days Kick off your trip in Pensacola and delve into the city's past at Historic Pensacola Village. Then cruise towards the alluring white-sand beaches of the Gulf Coast, meandering back roads and byways to discover northern Florida's hidden treasures along the way. Experience crystal-clear springs, including the Spanish-moss-lined Wakulla Springs, where you can take a tour in a glass-bottomed boat, and Ichetucknee Springs, which you can enjoy from the relaxed comfort of an inner tube. See manatees (between November and March) from the viewing platforms at Blue Spring State Park, then round off your trip with a classic roadside attraction starring the performing ""mermaids"" of Weeki Wachee. Planning tip: Florida's springs are significantly colder than its oceans. Consider packing or renting a wetsuit, particularly during visits in the winter months. Best road trip for a taste of Florida's western edge
Perdido Key–Tallahassee; 254 miles; 3–4 days The Florida Panhandle on the Gulf Coast is blessed with beach bliss and southern charm. Start your eastward journey near the Alabama border in Perdido Key, a barrier island with turquoise waters and expansive wetlands. Eastward, make sure to hop on Scenic Highway 30A in South Walton County. Stops include Rosemary Beach, where La Crema Tapas & Chocolate serves up a decadent chocolate fondue; the Alys Beach Nature Trail, which has elevated boardwalks to navigate the 20-acre preserve of coastal forest; and Seaside, which is dotted with pastel-painted houses with picket fences. Fun fact: Seaside is where The Truman Show was filmed. End your trip with a visit to Tallahassee, the capital of Florida and home to the Museum of Florida History. Best road trip for tracing the Atlantic Coast
Amelia Island–Miami Beach; 475 miles; 6 days Drive the length of Florida all the way down the coast, and you'll get a sampling of all the highlights of the Sunshine State. You'll find historic towns, family-friendly attractions, the Latin flavor of Miami and miles and miles of beaches right beside you, inviting you to stop as often as you want. Start your trip on Amelia Island, a glorious barrier island with the moss-draped charm of the Deep South, and continue on down to see-and-be-seen Miami Beach. Detours worth making include St Augustine, the oldest permanent European settlement in the US; the undeveloped, pristine beaches of Canaveral National Seashore and the Space Coast where, if you time it right, you can see a rocket shoot into space. Planning tip: November through March is peak ""snowbird season"" in Florida, making driving along Highway 1 – and other major coastal routes – a bit more of a crawl as US holidaymakers travel south for some winter sunshine. Want to linger in Miami for a few days? We have the itinerary for you Best road trip for exploring the central heart of Florida
Jacksonville–Ocala; 112 miles; 3–4 days With nearly one million residents, Jacksonville is Florida's largest city (nearly double the population of Miami). After gawking at giraffes at Jacksonville Zoological Gardens and being inspired at the Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville, head southwest to Gainesville, the home of the University of Florida. Very much loaded with students when school is in session, the town is also home to the Florida Museum of Natural History and the stunningly blue Ginnie Springs nearby. Cap off your trip with a stop in Ocala, with outdoor adventures aplenty, including the woodsy, lake-loaded Ocala National Forest and, for gear heads, the Don Garlist Museum of Drag Racing, which houses nearly 100 race-tested vehicles. Best road trip for the whole family
Kennedy Space Center–Sanibel & Captiva Islands; 288 miles; 6–10 days This trip links up most of Florida's best family-friendly attractions, including sprawling white-sand beaches and all the sights you can squeeze into your vacation and more. Begin at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to wonder at the science and ambition behind 20th- and 21st-century space exploration (and buy some astronaut ice cream, naturally). From there, hop on I-4 westbound toward Central Florida and its more imaginative delights. Let your inner child loose in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World® but don't stop there; you'll find plenty more to entertain you in dizzying Orlando, including Universal Studios and Harry P Leu Gardens, for when you crave a short respite from the frenetic pace. Next, cross the state toward Tampa, turning south when you arrive near the coast. Be sure to check out the historic buildings and wrought-iron balconies of Ybor City and the lovely beaches in Sarasota before winding up on the beaches of Sanibel and Captiva Islands. Can't get enough of Florida's theme parks? These are the best ones to visit Best road trip for seeing wildlife
Homestead–Everglades City; 170 miles; 2–3 days The enticing Everglades make South Florida truly unique. This ecological wonderland is the USA's largest subtropical wilderness, flush with endangered and rare species, including its star attraction, the alligator – and there are lots of them. It's not just a wetland, swamp, prairie or grassland – it's all of the above, twisted into a series of soft horizons, long vistas and sunsets that stretch across your entire field of vision. From the town of Homestead, head for the park's southeastern entrance and get ready to immerse yourself in nature. Be sure to plan pitstops to kayak in Flamingo, take a tram tour in Shark Valley and search for Bigfoot in Ochopee before heading on to Everglades City to uncover the region's history at the volunteer-run Museum of the Everglades. Detour: Work in a bonus national park by visiting Biscayne National Park, a boater's paradise 20 minutes east of Homestead. Add these experiences to your Everglades itinerary Best road trip for island hopping
John Pennekamp State Park–Key West; 102 miles; 3–5 days Short of hopping on a plane, there's no better way to enjoy such an utter feeling of escape from the mainland than driving through the Florida Keys. The motto here seems to be ""do whatever the hell you want.""  Pull off the highway for biker bars, seafood grills and blissful beaches wherever and whenever the crazy spirit of these islands moves you. Highlights on this 102-mile route include John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, the USA's first underwater park; historic Indian Key and forested Lignumvitae Key; and the marvel of engineering that is the overwater Seven Mile Bridge.  Planning tip: Embark on your Overseas Highway adventure as early in the day as possible, as some stretches tend to be congested after 11am, particularly on weekends.

706,12 essential sites to learn about Asian American history,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/asian-american-history-us,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2022-05/Alamy-KX73H5-RM.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 10, 2024","From art museums to Chinatown districts to the sobering Manzanar National Historic Site, these are the best places to learn the history of AAPI Americans.","Asian and Pacific Islander people have played a profoundly significant role in shaping American history, contributing to the rich heritage of the United States in countless ways. Given the alarming rise in bigotry toward the Asian American community in recent years, there’s never been a better time to check in on your Asian friends and let them know that they are seen, they are safe, and they are supported by countless other communities. Additionally, there’s never been a better moment to learn more about the contributions of AAPI Americans and their experiences all over the US, from vibrant Chinatown districts to museums to the sobering Manzanar National Historic Site. Here are 12 destinations in the USA where you can learn more about Asian American history and culture.  There’s no better cultural immersion experience than stepping into New York City’s bustling Chinatown, a lively neighborhood rich with history, built on the backbone of immigrants and carried on by multiple generations of families, entrepreneurs and community organizations.  “Chinatown is one of the US’ most iconic cultural enclaves for Asian Americans. Whether you’re a first-time visitor or a local resident, every corner of Chinatown has its gems,” explain Jennifer Tam and Christina Hui, co-founders of Welcome to Chinatown. “We encourage you to stop and learn the stories of the small business owners. It means so much to them when visitors offer a smile and acknowledge their entrepreneurial efforts. Shopping in Chinatown is unlike anywhere else – you can find household goods, special gifts made by hard-working people and, of course, delicious, authentic eats.” With a mission of bringing Asian art and culture to everyone, this must-see museum houses one of the most comprehensive Asian art collections in the world, with more than 18,000 works of art in its permanent collection. It even has a functioning authentic Japanese tea room on the second floor. With some 2500 works on display at any one time, the museum calls itself a “vibrant hub for discovering the magnificent artistic achievements and intriguing history of the world’s most populous continent.” In short, it’s an essential stop for anyone curious about Asian artistic endeavors. Built in 1910, this six-story hotel is a National Park Service-designated National Historic Landmark and remains impressively intact. Inside, visitors will find a haunting display: original belongings, suitcases, trunks, boxes and more of Japanese Americans who were incarcerated in relocation centers during World War II and who never returned to retrieve their goods. The first floor plays host to a tea room that is open to the public, while the basement houses the best-surviving example in the US of an urban Japanese-style bath house (or sento), designed by Sabro Ozasa, perhaps the first Japanese American architect to practice in Seattle. (For even more detail about the difficulties Asian Americans faced during this time, check out the best-selling historical novel Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford, which masterfully uses the hotel as the setting for its storyline.) Referred to as the “Ellis Island of the West,” Angel Island served as an active military installation during the Civil War and World War II and was transformed into an immigration station in 1905. Between 1910 and 1940, the site, located on the largest island in San Francisco Bay, processed up to an estimated one million immigrants to the US, including 250,000 Chinese and 150,000 Japanese people. Today, visitors can step back into time and peruse historic photographs, artifacts and a life-like recreation of immigration living quarters and interrogation rooms there.

707,12 of the best things to do in Dublin,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-things-to-do-in-dublin,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-04/500pxRF106947325.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 10, 2024","Ireland's capital is small but mighty, with a wealth of wonderful things to see and do. Here are 12 things to do in Dublin to get you started.","Ireland’s capital and largest city by far, Dublin is one of those places that you either get straight away or spend a lifetime trying to figure out. It’s not the prettiest city, but Dubliners will remind you that pretty things are as easy to like as they are to forget…before showing you the showstopper Georgian bits to prove that Dublin has a fine line in sophisticated elegance. There’s a collection of museums as fine as you’ll find in any European capital and one of the world’s most beautiful university campuses. There’s incredible food and a collection of authentic pubs that have spawned imitators from Miami to Mongolia. There’s whiskey and old prisons, ancient books and beautiful monuments. In Dublin, you’ll find something that will tickle your fancy. And when you’re done, there’s always the world’s greatest beer, brewed right here for the last 300 years.   Whether it’s your first visit to Dublin or your 20th, this is a city that keeps on giving. Here are a few ideas to get you started. In all likelihood, you don’t need us to tell you that the pub is a quintessential Dublin experience, but here we are. It’s where you’ll meet Dubliners at their convivial, easy-going best and get a sense of what makes this city tick. There are few Dublin institutions so fawned over and written about as the traditional pub – probably because so many of the city’s best-known writers were regulars in them. In Ulysses, Leopold Bloom muses that 'a good puzzle would be to cross Dublin without passing a pub,' to which the only logical answer is that it can be done…by going into everyone you see. Given that there are around 800 of them spread about the city it’s probably not the wisest thing to do if liver function is important to you, but there are a bunch of them that will make your Dublin stay all the more memorable. One of my favorites is John Mulligan of Poolbeg Street, which was also a favorite of Leopold Bloom’s creator, James Joyce.   Since its foundation in 1592, Trinity College has become one of the world’s most famous universities; it's the alma mater of Swift, Wilde and Beckett; it's where you'll find the most beautiful library in the whole country and the home of the world’s most famous illuminated Gospel, the Book of Kells. The library’s 200,000 books have been removed as part of a landmark restoration project, but the consolation prize is an enhanced digital experience that tells the story of the Book of Kells in dramatic, impressive detail. Trinity’s 16 hectares are an oasis of aesthetic elegance, its cobbled quadrangles lined with handsome neoclassical buildings that lend an air of magisterial calm to the campus, evident as soon as you walk through Front Arch. Local tip: If you’re visiting during the summer – ie outside of term time – you can stay in student accommodation for a fraction of the cost of a hotel on the other side of the walls. See visittrinity.ie. Hanging on the walls of a magnificent Georgian pile is arguably the city’s finest collection of modern and contemporary art, which runs the gamut from impressionist masterpieces (Degas, Monet, Manet et al) to Irish artists such as Dorothy Cross and Sean Scully as well as a collection of stained-glass windows by Harry Clarke. The Dublin City Gallery (aka the Hugh Lane, after its founder)’s most visited installation, however, is Dublin-born Francis Bacon’s actual London studio, brought over piece by piece and painstakingly reassembled in all its glorious mess – you can't step inside it but you can observe exactly how the artist lived and worked, down to the minute details.  Check out these budget-friendly tips for Dublin. Did you know that Dublin was once the epicenter of the global whiskey industry? The industry went kaput throughout the 20th century, but it’s slowly making a major resurgence, not least in the Liberties, once known as the Golden Triangle for the number of distilleries in operation there. Today, there are four: Teeling Distillery, the first new producer in the city for 125 years; Pearse Lyons Distillery, in an old church; the Dublin Liberties Distillery in a 400-year-old former mill and tannery; and the return of Roe & Co, which was once the world’s largest producer of whiskey, inside the old Guinness Power Station. On the other side of the Liffey, the old Jameson Distillery is now one of the city’s most popular attractions, while if you want to do some pretty serious tastings, there’s the Irish Whiskey Museum near Trinity College. Alfred Chester Beatty was a mining magnate with exceedingly good taste, and the fruit of his aesthetic sensibility is gathered in this remarkable museum. Books, manuscripts and scrolls were his particular love, and his collection includes the world's second-oldest biblical fragment and a collection of Qurans from the 9th to the 19th centuries that is considered among the best example of illuminated Islamic texts in the world. Other treasures include ancient Egyptian texts on papyrus, intricately designed little medicine boxes and perhaps the finest selection of Chinese jade books on the planet. Keep an eye on the calendar of events – it regularly runs qigong workshops on the rooftop garden, as well as sound baths and meditation sessions. You didn’t think we’d ignore arguably the world’s most famous brewery and the number one tourist attraction in the city, did you? Guinness is more than a beer, and you’ll get a pretty good sense of how much more it is during a visit to the seven-story Guinness Storehouse. Along the way you’ll learn how the beer is made (there are a couple of add-on, hands-on experiences to really deepen that knowledge), the role of the company in Dublin’s fortunes and how it became the global brand it is today.  The top floor is an atrium bar, where you put the theory to the test and drink a pint; just below it is an excellent spot for lunch. Local tip: The Guinness in the atrium bar is excellent, but the best Guinness comes with atmosphere; you’ll find the best of it in a traditional bar (see above). Ireland’s struggle for independence was a bloody and tempestuous journey, and this forbidding prison on the western edge of the city played a role in it for nearly 150 years, as the forced temporary home of many a rebel and revolutionary. Unoccupied since 1924, Kilmainham Gaol is now a museum with an enthralling exhibit on the history of Irish nationalism. The guided tour of its grim cells and corridors is highly memorable and it finishes in the yard where the leaders of the failed 1916 Easter Rising were executed. Planning tip: Book your tickets online to avoid being disappointed by sold-out tours; also best to book for an early morning tour as you’ll be waiting for less time. With a collection donated entirely by the general public, the award-winning Little Museum of Dublin on St Stephen’s Green is a surprising blockbuster. The memorabilia is quirky enough – it includes a lectern used by JFK during his visit in 1963 and the fateful letter given to the Irish delegation during the negotiations that ended Ireland’s War of Independence in 1921 (and whose inherent contradictions led indirectly to the Civil War the next year) – but it’s a brilliant way of getting a potted history of the city. There’s even a whole floor dedicated to U2. Visits are by guided tour only, but they’re great fun.   Planning tip: The museum runs great tours beyond its walls, including a daily walking tour of St Stephen's Green, as well as a themed weekly tour telling the story of Ireland's influential women. Ireland’s most important cultural institution is the National Museum of Ireland, which has four branches nationwide – three of which are in Dublin. The National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology on Kildare Street is the most significant, with an extraordinary collection of Celtic and early Christian gold as well as the macabre ‘bog bodies’ – four Iron Age figures in various states of preservation. On the other side of the Liffey, just off the quays, is the Decorative Arts & History branch, housed in a beautiful 18th century barracks. On Merrion Square is the Natural History Museum, affectionately known as the ‘Dead Zoo.’   The choice of restaurants in Dublin has never been better. Every cuisine and every trend – from doughnuts on the run to kale with absolutely everything – is catered for, as the city seeks to satisfy the discerning taste buds of its diners. From Neapolitan style pizza at Sano to Michelin-starred feasts at Chapter One, you’ll find something for every mood and budget. One of the more popular trends in 2024 was for KFC – no, not that kind, but Korean Fried Chicken – with a bunch of authentic spots opening up all over town. One of my favorites is White Rabbit on Capel St, not-so-hidden in the back of a Korean grocery store.   Planning tip: It can be pretty tough to get a table at the trendiest spots in town, so book well in advance – two weeks if possible, but months if you’re looking for a Michelin-starred meal. Dublin is on the sea, and some of the city’s loveliest neighbourhoods are standalone villages worth exploring, not least the fishing village of Howth, at the end of the DART train line to the north. The village itself is gorgeous, built around a busy pier and packed with restaurants serving the freshest of fresh catch, but the real treat is the Howth Cliff Path Walk, a 6km (3.7 mile) loop that takes you over the headland for gorgeous views over the grassy slopes to the sea. If you want to do a proper hike, there are longer routes that lead to the Baily Lighthouse and back over rough, mountainous terrain. Local tip: On weekends and bank holidays, the Howth Market sells a huge selection of organic produce and baked goods as well as handicrafts.  Navigate like a local with these tips for getting around. OK, so the Book of Kells and the Old Library are way more famous, and way more visited, but that makes Marsh’s Library – on a side street by St Patrick’s Cathedral, all the more worthwhile. The magnificently preserved scholars' library founded by Archbishop Narcissus Marsh in 1701 has barely changed a jot since then: atop its ancient stairs are beautiful dark-oak bookcases filled with 25,000 books from the 16th century to the early 18th century, as well as maps, manuscripts (including one in Latin dating from 1400) and a collection of incunabula (books printed before 1500). Local tip: When you walk from the first hall into the second, strike up a conversation with the resident librarians. They can tell you their personal theories (or experiences) of the resident ghost and show you the spines of the books bearing bullet holes from the 1916 Easter Rising."," Ireland’s capital and largest city by far, Dublin is one of those places that you either get straight away or spend a lifetime trying to figure out.

708,"The best time to visit Washington, DC",https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-time-to-visit-washington-dc,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/GettyImages-2052274111.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 9, 2024","Here's your guide to the seasons in DC, from when to see cherry blossoms in bloom, to when to avoid the crowds.","There's never a bad time to visit Washington, DC. Not only do brilliant events take place almost every day, but the district also undergoes breathtakingly beautiful transformations as the seasons change. March's explosion of cherry blossoms might well be the biggest magnet for many, but don't underestimate the beauty of a snow-dusted US Capitol in winter, fall foliage sessions at the city's National Arboretum, and lazy summer days cooling off by the Tidal Basin. Here are the pros and cons of visiting at different times of the year. January, February and March are the cheapest months to visit Washington DC, although February is your best bet – shoppers heading to the city for the January sales can push up prices at the start of the year, and the second half of March is when the cherry blossoms begin to bloom. Visit in February, and you can expect temperatures between 27°F and 47°F, along with odd snowfall. One minor downside is that, although all of DC's top attractions will be open, it's trickier to find guided tours during this time, as many pause operations between December and March. One important tip: avoid fixed-price restaurant menus around Valentine's Day, when restaurants hike up costs. On a budget? Check out these top things to do for free in Washington, DC March is when the city's cherry blossom trees burst with color. Working out exactly when the blooms will appear isn't an exact science, but it's usually in the second half of March. In early March, there are daily blossom updates for the city's indicator tree (yes, there really is such a thing), along with the best areas to spot them. Top spots include the National Mall, where you'll find cherry blossom trees gifted to the country by Japan; and the banks of the Tidal Basin, which is lined with trees.  For an extra dose of flower power, book a hotel with views of DC's cherry blossoms. These include several properties in the Wharf area, due to its proximity to the Tidal Basin. The InterContinental Washington DC, Hyatt House Washington DC and Canopy by Hilton Washington DC are all great options. Another ideal base is the Foggy Bottom neighborhood – book a hotel here, and you'll be a short walk from both the National Mall and the Tidal Basin. During Passport DC, a month-long event that celebrates DC's international diplomatic community, around 50 embassies open their doors to the public, offering behind-the-scenes tours and hosting events that offer insights into their countries. Admission is free, but you'll need to book tickets on the Passport DC website. The events are incredibly diverse, ranging from llama-petting sessions at the Peruvian embassy to craft masterclasses at the Swedish embassy (which has a beautiful rooftop patio that opens to the public during Passport DC).  Most embassies will serve up various regional delicacies, and there are regular Q&A sessions with ambassadors. Stick to a maximum of six a day, starting with the most popular ones (these tend to include Brazil, Ireland, the UK and Japan) to avoid long queues. Book your accommodation early, as hotels quickly reach maximum occupancy during this time. Hotels on Embassy Row – where most of the embassies are located – include The Fairfax at Embassy Row and The Ven at Embassy Row, but these also come with the highest prices. Visit DC in June and July, and you'll get great weather and lots of sun without the energy-sapping humidity of August and September. The downside? These months are often the busiest, which means prices for everything, from hotels to restaurants, tend to be higher (and that's after accounting for airfares, which increase by around 30%).  That said, there are several brilliant annual events held during this time too, including, on July 4, a dramatized rereading of the Declaration of Independence on the steps of the National Archives, various Fourth of July events (including a Capital Fourth concert held on the West Lawn of the US Capitol) and the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, which usually starts in late June and finishes in early July. August and September are both hot and humid, although the mercury is generally at its highest in August, when temperatures regularly exceed 90°F. Events in September include the DC Shorts International Film Festival, DC Jazz Fest, when jazz musicians do their thing at dozens of venues across the city, and Art all Night, a two-night, nighttime performing arts festival with performances throughout DC. Thanksgiving in Washington, DC is marked with various parades (the largest ones take place on Market St and Freedom Dr), and it's also when the city's tree-lighting ceremony takes place. In December, the weather generally hovers between 34°F and 46°F, making it a fantastic time for a few laps around one of the city's public ice rinks. For a brilliant backdrop, it's hard to beat the ice rink outside the National Gallery of Art. However, the one on the Wharf's Transit Pier ticks the fun factor box – you'll be right on the water's edge and can pair an ice-skating session with a gig at one of the Wharf's three music venues.  Love a twinkly Christmas light? Head to historic Georgetown to check out the beautifully-lit townhouses and to sign up for one of the Georgetown Glow walking tours held throughout December, when artists from across the US fill the neighborhood's streets with spectacular light installations. Finally, don't dismiss Washington, DC's most famous landmarks. Yes, you'll have to contend with the occasional crowd, but the elaborate displays are too good to miss. At the top of your list should be Washington National Cathedral, famous for its beautiful Christmas lights and regular carol recitals, and the United States Botanical Garden, where Christmas decorations include model trains, replicas of DC landmarks made from flowers, and gorgeous displays of poinsettias. These experiences should be on your DC itinerary

709,The 8 best things to do in Miami,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-things-to-do-in-miami,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/GettyImages-1855617110.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 9, 2024","Visitors to Miami will find beautiful beaches, art deco delights, tropical gardens and a lively arts scene.","Miami is most known for being a hub of Latin American culture with a 24/7 party atmosphere, and that’s not wrong. But as one of the fastest growing metro areas in the country, the city clearly has even more to offer every sort of traveler.  So how do you choose where to spend your time and money in Miami? Yes, there are nightclubs and bars a-plenty. But there are also world-class museums, literary events, all kinds of sports, theater and more Latin cuisine than you ever even knew existed. No matter your interests, these are the best things to do in the Magic City. Cuban coffee is king in Miami, and there’s no better way to enjoy some than by ordering it from a ventanita – that is, a cafe window. Ventanitas serve not only as convenient coffee and snack spots, but also as spaces to have conversations and catch up on news and life. Versailles is a popular spot both for locals and tourists alike, but drive around Miami enough, and you’ll likely encounter several of these on-the-go coffee spots. Continue your Miami coffee tour at these amazing cafes Local Tip: Learn about the different types of coffee drinks ahead of time. Cafe con leche is akin to a sweet hot latte. A colada is more like several shots of sugary supercharged espresso served in a styrofoam cup, and it's meant to be shared.  You can’t visit Miami without dipping your toes in the warm Atlantic waters at least once. The best family-friendly beaches are Crandon Park and Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park – both great for barbecuing, biking and swimming. For more action and prime people-watching, stretch out on South Beach. Mid-beach all the way through Bal Harbour tends to have less public access, meaning slightly fewer crowds. If you hate tan lines and don’t blush easily, Haulover Beach (featuring the city’s only nude beach) might pique your interest.  Local Tip: If you can’t stand the heat and humidity but still love to hear the waves, walk onto the sand anywhere from South to North Beach after dark and spend some quiet beach time under the stars. Visit more of our favorite beaches in Miami There’s no shortage of boats to ride on in Miami, but you’ll want to choose the right experience for you. Many boat tours can be found in and around Bayside Marketplace (a tourist-friendly shopping and dining hotspot in Downtown Miami). These tend to vary from a general 1-2 hour “party boat” experience that takes you into Biscayne Bay with music and drinks, to millionaire mansion sightseeing tours, to sightseeing speedboat tours for those who enjoy a faster pace. There are other options, like private boat tours of Stiltsville and Biscayne National Park (parts of Miami that are only accessible by boat), as well as small sailing experiences out of Coconut Grove. Local Tip: Already have experience driving a boat? You can easily rent one by the hour for a more intimate boating experience.  What was once a few blocks of struggling art galleries has become a gentrified mass of high rises, restaurants, bars, and well, a lot more art. You can still visit some of the long-standing cultural institutions and galleries in the area like the Margulies Collection and the Wynwood Walls, as well as the Bakehouse Art Complex. More importantly, you can still find plenty of art by simply walking around the neighborhood – murals and graffiti have long been a staple here. And of course, don’t forget to bring your camera. The photo ops are endless. Local Tip: If you can deal with the crowds and traffic, visit during the first week of December for Art Basel – an international art show with multiple satellite events, many of which take place in and around Wynwood. It’s a great time for seeing new art (and even getting to watch street artists at work). No matter where you are in the 305, you’re bound to find an art museum nearby. North Miami is home to the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA NoMi), whose collection includes works by artists like Keith Haring and Anna Gaskell. The Bass Museum of Art in Miami Beach is one of the city’s oldest art museums, open since 1964. Both Florida International University and the University of Miami house their own art museums – the Frost in Sweetwater and the Lowe in Coral Gables, respectively. And if you want to see a truly impressive collection of Latin American art, make time for the Perez Art Museum. Local Tip: Many museums feature free days at least once a month. Check their websites for info and plan accordingly. The largest subtropical wilderness in the country, the Everglades is a magical place home to gators, crocs, turtles, frogs, snakes and dozens upon dozens of species of birds from cranes, ducks and geese, to anhingas, spoonbills and more. There are several entrances to Everglades National Park that feature nature centers, hiking trails and ranger-led experiences. You can also venture to businesses like Everglades Safari Park (not affiliated with the national park), where you can ride in an airboat along the river of grass. There are several entrances to Everglades National Park that feature nature centers, hiking trails and ranger-led experiences, with the closest entrance to greater Miami being via the Shark Valley Visitor Center. Local Tip: Pack plenty of bug spray and sunscreen for your visit. While beautiful, the environment of the Everglades can be rough on anyone. Add these Everglades experiences to your itinerary The Magic City’s got plenty going on when it comes to sports, though locals generally root hardest for the Miami Heat, our three-time NBA champs. You can catch them live at the Kaseya Center in the heart of Downtown Miami. If baseball is more your speed, tickets to see the Marlins are generally affordable for games at LoanDepot Park in Little Havana (fun fact: it’s one of the few baseball stadiums in the country with a retractable roof). And finally, football fans can root for the Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium up in Miami Gardens (and if college football is more to your liking, the University of Miami’s Hurricanes play up there as well). Local Tip: If tickets aren’t available, do as the locals do and head to the closest Flanigan’s to watch any and all games while enjoying beer and wings alongside other fans. The most famous street in Miami is undoubtedly Calle Ocho – in fact, it even has a festival named after it. While attending this annual block party is recommended at least once, you can still enjoy plenty of Cuban culture if you walk along the stretch of Calle Ocho that cuts through Little Havana. Pop into Los Pinarenos Fruteria for some guarapo (sugar cane juice), watch the elders playing dominos at Maximo Gomez Park, snap photos of the Cuban Walk of Fame and take in some more culture at the CubaOcho Museum. And of course, don’t forget to stop by Ball and Chain for drinks and dancing (they occasionally host salsa lessons as well)! Planning Tip: First time in the area? Book a tour like this one to get some insider knowledge of the history of the area and get some tasty treats along the way. Figure out the best time to visit

Learn how to get around like a local"," Miami is most known for being a hub of Latin American culture with a 24/7 party atmosphere, and that’s not wrong. Cuban coffee is king in Miami, and there’s no better way to enjoy some than by ordering it from a ventanita – that is, a cafe window. Versailles is a popular spot both for locals and tourists alike, but drive around Miami enough, and you’ll likely encounter several of these on-the-go coffee spots. If you hate tan lines and don’t blush easily, Haulover Beach (featuring the city’s only nude beach) might pique your interest. Local Tip: If you can’t stand the heat and humidity but still love to hear the waves, walk onto the sand anywhere from South to North Beach after dark and spend some quiet beach time under the stars."

It's filled with kid-friendly museums, has an abundance of parks in which younger visitors can burn off excess energy, and a logical, pedestrian-friendly layout (let's not forget that DC was designed to showcase urban planning at its very best).  Here are our top tips for exploring the city with children. As America's first purpose-built city, Washington, DC, is, in many ways, a dream to explore with younger visitors. It's flat with very few hills, and roads and sidewalks are wide, smooth and well-maintained, perfect for parents pushing strollers.  Almost all of DC's top attractions are refreshingly accessible – every Smithsonian Museum has ramps, for example, and most museums and major landmarks will have family-friendly restrooms. Generally, you'll almost always be able to enter with strollers, although the White House, which has some of the tightest restrictions, is one of the few places where strollers are on the banned list.  The large number of gardens and parks means there are endless places for kids to burn off excess energy – the National Mall, for example, has over 20,000 trees and numerous dedicated picnic areas with benches and tables. Thirsty kids (and their parents) are also in luck – most businesses, including restaurants, museums and galleries, will happily top up water bottles, and you'll find public water fountains throughout the city, including 47 on the National Mall alone.

711,The best time to go to Sedona,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-time-to-visit-sedona,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/GettyImages-1875654186.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,"Apr 9, 2024","If you’re looking for the best time of year to visit Sedona, we've got the perfect month-by-month guide to the weather and the best things to do.","As one of Arizona’s most alluring desert cities, Sedona has long ignited the imagination of adventurers, artists and mystics. Now wine tours and film festivals have added to its eclectic vibe, with natural and cultural worlds coming together.  Sedona’s dramatic landscape features 400 miles of trails that twist among spiky cactuses and lead to vermillion peaks in idiosyncratic shapes (look for Snoopy and the coffee pot). The city is also the epicenter for sacred Indigenous sites, energy vortexes, UFO sightings and a booming spiritual scene. Situated in the Verde Valley’s high desert at 4350ft, Sedona has four distinct seasons, with mostly moderate temperatures year-round. Whether you come for hiking and biking adventures, wine-tasting excursions or luxury escapes at the spa, here’s a guide to the best times to visit Sedona. Spring is sublime in Sedona when warmer temperatures (average highs are in the mid-70s) bring cactus blooms, as well as crowds from within the state escaping southern Arizona’s savage summer heat. April and May are the busiest months in Sedona and hotels can be pricey. Fall weather is similar, but without the masses, giving it an edge when choosing the ideal time for outdoor activities like hiking to vortex sites and biking the red-dirt terrain. Snow in the desert? A few inches fall in Sedona, bringing the rare opportunity to take photos of the red rocks crowned in white. Winters are mild, with average highs up to 60F. Hotel rooms are more affordable, so it’s a great time to rejuvenate at Sedona’s superb resorts. In summer, expect heavy afternoon downpours (along with the spectacle of thunder and lightning), typically in July and August. The leaves of Sedona’s oaks and bigtooth maples change color in fall, adding another layer of splendor to the diverse desert landscape whether wandering through the forests at West Fork Trail or driving the scenic State Route 89A through Oak Creek Canyon. Quiet days and fewer visitors in January means there’s room for contemplating those big swings when teeing off on Sedona’s championship golf courses. Fairways are open year-round, framed by fragrant junipers and surrounded by Sedona’s iconic sculpted sandstone.  Key event: Winter Play Day  Crisp February days are perfect for taking in the year’s first festivals and events. During the Sedona Half Marathon, athletes test their legs and lungs running among the ponderosa pines in Coconino National Forest, while silver-screen devotees can choose from more than 140 documentaries and indie films to watch during the nine-day annual international festival. Key events: Sedona Half Marathon, Sedona International Film Festival  Early spring heralds the start of Sedona’s busy season, with hotel prices starting their upward climb in March. Book accommodations early if you plan to participate in Sedona’s signature mountain bike and yoga festivals. Get out early to explore any of the area’s 200 trails to enjoy an adrenaline rush or slice of solitude in nature without the crowds.  Key events:  Sedona Yoga Festival, Sedona Mountain Bike Festival, Sedona Stumble With sunny days, flawless skies, and pleasant weather, April is a great month to discover Sedona’s artistic side. Stroll among its 80-plus art galleries and shops, and listen to classical and contemporary piano performances. Key events: Sedona Open Studios Tour, Piano on the Rocks International Festival, Verde Valley Birding and Nature Festival  The high desert starts to heat up, signaling cholla and prickly pear cactuses to burst into purple and yellow flowers. In May, Sedona buzzes with activity and hotel prices spike, especially with the city hosting events like its biannual concert series, held every Friday in May (and September). Key events: Verde Valley Wine Festival, Red Dirt Concert Series High temps still only hover around 90 in June, but humidity hasn’t hit yet (that comes during monsoon season) and there’s a slowdown of visitors. That means better rates on rooms and an opportunity to splurge on a stellar stay. The reliably gorgeous days and comfortable nights lure people outside to enjoy free movies in the park under a blanket of stars. Key events: Oak Creek Arts and Crafts Show, Summer Cinema Series  Expect weekend day-trippers escaping “the Valley” (greater Phoenix), where temperatures soar in summer. You won’t have to compete for hotels, but prepare to retreat indoors when sudden monsoons soak Sedona, sometimes bringing dangerous flash floods. Weather won’t deter nature, though: July is peak season for spotting up to seven species of hummingbirds. Key events: Fourth of July Wet Fest, Oak Creek Arts and Crafts Show, Sedona Hummingbird Festival Temperatures wane in August and so do room rates, bringing a beautiful balance to the end of summer. Sedona’s usually packed guided excursions see a drop-off in tourists. It’s the ideal month to curate your own desert adventure. Key event: Fool Me Twice!  Activities ramp up again in early fall, with September heralding the harvest season in the Verde Valley’s vineyards and feted right in Sedona during winefest. Book accommodations and restaurants well ahead of time. Need some chill time after all the partying? Find some solitude during an outdoor yoga session or sunrise hike to one of Sedona’s four energy vortexes. Key events: Sedona Winefest, Earth Medicine Festival, Vortifest, Red Dirt Concert Series Hotel prices and temperatures start to cool off again, but fall festivals – music, painting, crafts – celebrating Sedona’s flourishing arts scene are in full swing, making October one of the best times to visit. Key events: Sedona Plein Air Festival, Red Rocks Oktoberfest, Sedona Arts Festival, Fall Arts & Crafts Fair, Red Rocks Music Festival Sedona is still gorgeous in November, with daytime temperatures in the mid-60s. Visitors can soak up the last warm days touring the backcountry, joining a 5k Thanksgiving run, sampling food truck eats or drifting above the otherworldly landscape on a hot air balloon ride. Key events: Sedona Food Truck Festival, Sedona Turkey Trot Aside from the usual holiday season revelry, December is one of the quietest times to visit Sedona. It’s easier to come by coveted restaurant reservations, find bargain hotels with cozy fireplaces and take romantic strolls on normally busy trails such as Cathedral Rock, and Devil’s Bridge without the crowds.
