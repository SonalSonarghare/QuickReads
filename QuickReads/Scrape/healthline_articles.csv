101,Can You Get Bird Flu from Milk and Eggs? What to Know,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/bird-flu-risk-milk-and-eggs,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/milk-and-eggs-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 11, 2024","As bird flu continues to spread among dairy cows and poultry, here’s what health experts say you need to know about your risk from eating eggs and…","In recent years, two people in the U.S. have contracted bird flu from animals. Their symptoms were mild, and they recovered quickly. The risk of transmission from animals to humans is considered to be low. Eggs and dairy are safe, provided the eggs are cooked and the dairy is pasteurized. Experts say it is safest to avoid raw animal products. On April 1, 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that a person in Texas had tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as “bird flu.” According to the agency, the person had been exposed to the HPAI A(H5N1) virus via presumably infected dairy cattle. The CDC’s press release
stated that the person’s only symptom was eye redness. They were being isolated and treated with an antiviral drug. This report brings the total number of humans in the U.S. who have contracted the virus to two. The CDC previously released a statement
in April 2022 about another human case that occurred in Colorado. In that case, the disease was contracted via exposure to poultry. The symptoms again were mild, with the patient reporting feeling tired for a few days and then recovering after undergoing isolation and antiviral treatment. Given the fact that these people contracted the virus through exposure to both cows and chickens, this begs the question of whether people could potentially catch bird flu by drinking milk or eating eggs. Here’s what health experts have to say. Dr. Daisy May — a veterinary surgeon and pet care writer for All About Parrots — explained that HPAI can spread rapidly among wild birds and domestic poultry like chickens and turkeys. “It’s been wreaking havoc on poultry farms across the country this year,” she said. May went on to say that, although bird flu is mainly an animal health issue, there have been cases where it jumped to humans when they had been in extremely close, prolonged contact with infected animals. “So it seems the risk is relatively low but not zero,” said May. The CDC echoed May’s opinion, stating that “[t]his infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low.” People who work closely over extended periods of time with infected animals — especially those who are not taking precautions — are at the greatest risk, they note. May said the bigger question on everyone’s mind is whether our food supply is safe. “For eggs, as long as you’re fully cooking them until the yolks are firm with no runny parts, the risks are very low, according to food safety experts,” she said. “Any potentially present virus would be killed off by proper heat treatment.” According to May, it’s raw or undercooked eggs that could pose a problem since the virus may be able to survive within the yolk. “As for milk and dairy, we’re in great shape there thanks to pasteurization,” she said. “That heating process is more than enough to neutralize any lingering bird flu virus.” So, you can continue to consume milk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products without worry, according to May. She added, however, that one area of concern is raw, unpasteurized dairy products like you would obtain from small farms or private sellers. “While there haven’t been any documented cases of transmission that way, some extra caution may be warranted,” said May. However, it’s also important to note that it is possible to contract other (often bacterial) illnesses from raw or undercooked eggs
or raw milk
. May said that if you “want to play it extra safe,” you should stick with fully cooked eggs and pasteurized dairy products. It’s also essential to properly handle and cook all meat and poultry, making sure it reaches a safe internal temperature, she said. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), this would be 165 °F (73.9 °C) for poultry and 145 °F (62.8 °C) for beef as measured with a food thermometer. Finally, make sure you do a thorough job of washing your hands when you work with any raw animal products, said May. Nancy Mitchell — a registered nurse and a contributing writer at Assisted Living — added that it’s important to also be careful about how you handle eggshells. “Feces from infected birds will likely carry the bird flu virus,” she explained. “This means that handling eggs that are still soiled with bird feces could put you at risk of contracting the illness.” If you are handling eggshells, use single-use gloves and avoid touching your face with your hands prior to washing them with soap and water, she said. Mitchell further advises that you don’t assume an eggshell is clean just because there’s no visible sign of feces. “Viruses are microscopic, and fecal particles could be lingering in places that the naked eye can’t detect,” she said. However, it’s important to note that most USDA-graded eggs or large-volume egg processors include a washing step followed by a sanitizing rinse. In recent years, there have been two reported cases of bird flu being transmitted from animals to humans. The CDC states that the risk of contracting bird flu is low, but the risk is greater for those who are working closely with infected animals over an extended period of time. Experts say to avoid eating raw eggs or drinking unpasteurized milk. You should also make sure that poultry and other meats reach an adequate internal temperature in order to kill any pathogens that might be present. Other steps you can take to protect yourself include using gloves to handle any potentially contaminated eggshells, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and washing your hands thoroughly after handling raw animal products."," On April 1, 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that a person in Texas had tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as “bird flu.” According to the agency, the person had been exposed to the HPAI A(H5N1) virus via presumably infected dairy cattle.

102,People Are Misdiagnosing Themselves with Autism from TikTok Misinformation,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/autism-self-diagnosis-tiktok,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/young-woman-distracted-phone-laptop-procrastination-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 11, 2024",Misinformation on social media platforms like TikTok are leading a growing number of people to inaccurately diagnose themselves with autism spectrum…,"Social media platforms like TikTok are encouraging self-diagnosis and misinformation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Experts share the dangers of self-diagnosing mental health conditions. Reliable online resources offer a reputable alternative to misinformation. In the era of TikTok, self-diagnosis of mental health conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is on the rise among young people. Some posts include people sharing reasons they believe their self-diagnosis is valid, while others contain mental health professionals stressing the importance of getting diagnosed by a provider. “Self-diagnosis has always been a risky pursuit. Social media has only increased the potential dangers of self-diagnosis,” Joseph O’Brien, LCSW, manager of the Behavioral Wellness Center at Inspira Health, told Healthline. Misinformation spreading across social media enhances the dangers. In fact, only 27% of the most popular autism-related TikTok videos contained accurate information, according to a study
from Drexel University’s A.J. Drexel Autism Institute. The study also revealed that 32% of videos were overly generalized, while over 41% were completely inaccurate. Researchers looked at the dangers by analyzing engagement indicators, including views and likes for TikTok videos associated with the “Autism” hashtag. The content of the most viewed videos were fact-checked, with a focus on those that provided information on autism as a condition, such as what causes it or how to identify it. Then the videos were marked as either accurate, inaccurate, or ‘overgeneralization’ based on the consistency of the information in the videos with current reputable knowledge on autism. The same study reported that misleading and inaccurate videos had been viewed almost 150 million times. While more attention on ASD can bring about advocacy and understanding of the condition, as well as greater acceptance of individual differences, Diane Franz, PhD, a pediatric psychologist at Children’s Hospital New Orleans, said misleading information online and across social media is harmful. “The tendency to look for a diagnosis to explain any variations in personality and behavior takes away from accepting normal variety among children and adults, and minimizes the significance of living with a significant disorder that impacts many aspects of the person’s life,” she told Healthline. Experts share the following concerns about misinformation regarding ASD. Utilization of standardized assessments administered by professionals maintains the integrity of the diagnostic system, and ensures that correct individuals are identified, said Franz. “The risks of self-diagnosis are essentially that it is likely to be inaccurate, which will not allow the individual to be eligible for services needed to support them in all aspects of their lives,” she said. O’Brien added that diagnosing ASD is not done instantaneously but, rather, over time as the therapist gathers information and becomes familiar with their clients. “Diagnosing is ultimately up to the therapist’s discretion but is best made as part of a conversation between therapist and client,” he said. “The situation is often made more complicated when the self-diagnoses are at odds with the observations of the therapist.” Given the current use of algorithms by social media platforms, O’Brien said people might be exposed to a steady flow of the same misinformation, deepening their attachment to the information or diagnosis. “This makes navigating the diagnosis conversation for the therapist a very difficult task that can result in a power struggle between the training and experience of the therapist and the social media exposure of the client,” he said. He added that is especially true for ASD, mood disorders, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders, and cannabis use disorder. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is the handbook used by healthcare professionals as the authoritative guide for diagnosing mental health disorders. “Even if one takes the DSM-5 with a grain of salt, having a shared language with very specific meanings to allow providers to communicate with each other and their clients is of the utmost importance,” said O’Brien. The trend of self-diagnosis on social media has “watered down” the common understanding of diagnoses, especially ASD, and shifted the meaning of the diagnosis, he added. “When working with adolescents, it is now very common for them to attend an intake session convinced that they have bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and are being ‘gaslit’ by their narcissistic parents,” said O’Brien. “Almost always, they are using these terms in ways that therapists are not using them.” The intensity and frequency of exposure to misinformation on social media is powerful and makes O’Brien’s clients resistant to education. He said it also creates difficulty for the visibility of, and advocacy for, certain populations like people living with ASD. “Self-diagnosing challenges professionally made diagnoses and might serve to disenfranchise those members of these groups who have diagnoses from professionals,” he said. Additionally, if ‘everyone’ identifies as having ASD, then the diagnosis loses its meaning for the community of people who have worked to obtain visibility and accommodations. “Furthermore, if the condition is treated as so widespread that it becomes statistically ‘normal,’ then the very need for accommodations will be undermined,” said O’Brien. In addition to the inaccurate information on social media and online, there are a plethora of reliable sources of information on mental health conditions. “Social media, in and of itself, is not the enemy,” said O’Brien. “The real threat seems to be our unquestioning, naïve relationship to social media and our belief that diagnoses can be self-made without consulting a professional.” Franz suggests organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics as a resource for information on ASD and to find providers and autism services in your area. “They should also consult with their pediatrician, who is trained to screen and be the first line professional to detect concerns for autism spectrum disorder,” she said. “For older individuals, consultation with either a medical professional or psychological professional is a good place to start.”"," Social media has only increased the potential dangers of self-diagnosis,” Joseph O’Brien, LCSW, manager of the Behavioral Wellness Center at Inspira Health, told Healthline. While more attention on ASD can bring about advocacy and understanding of the condition, as well as greater acceptance of individual differences, Diane Franz, PhD, a pediatric psychologist at Children’s Hospital New Orleans, said misleading information online and across social media is harmful. “The tendency to look for a diagnosis to explain any variations in personality and behavior takes away from accepting normal variety among children and adults, and minimizes the significance of living with a significant disorder that impacts many aspects of the person’s life,” she told Healthline."

Despite prior findings that advised against acetaminophen, experts said it is safe to use and the best option for pregnancy pain and fever relief. There are numerous genetic and environmental factors that impact a child’s risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Using acetaminophen during pregnancy was not linked with drastically increased children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability in sibling control analysis, according to a new study. The findings
were published April 9 in JAMA. Researchers wanted to understand if there are risks of using acetaminophen sold under the brand name Tylenol in the U.S. during pregnancy. Co-senior author of the study, Renee M. Gardner PhD, a researcher at the Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, told Healthline, that they wanted to study this subject after a group of researchers stated in the medical journal
Nature Reviews Endocrinology that women should be cautioned against using acetaminophen during pregnancy over concerns that it could disrupt the nervous system of the developing fetus and influence hormone signaling. “There was a strong response to that statement, including a number of letters published in the same journal disputing the conclusions and pointing out that such ‘calls for action’ run the risk of adding anxiety and guilt among pregnant women,” Gardner told Healthline. “We knew that this fear and anxiety must also be affecting many expectant parents across the world, and we also knew that there were some substantial limitations to the existing studies that examined the relationship between [acetaminophen] and neurodevelopmental disorders.” As a result, they decided to use Swedish data to study the question of whether acetaminophen use was robustly associated with risks for neurodevelopmental conditions like autism and ADHD, while addressing limitations of previous studies. Brian Lee PhD, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, co-senior author, explained the methodology behind the study. “We first aimed to replicate the same sorts of a ssociations that other researchers had reported between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and children’s neurodevelopmental outcomes such as autism and ADHD, and then we aimed to understand if those associations were also apparent in analyses when we controlled for different indications of acetaminophen use and when we compared full siblings,” said Lee. Researchers were able to gather data on acetaminophen use during pregnancy from two sources. During prenatal care, women were asked by their attending midwives if they regularly take medications or supplements. Women were prompted at different points throughout their prenatal care to report on medication use, including at the first visit. The second source of data was a register of drug prescriptions that is kept in Sweden. Acetaminophen is available over the counter as is the case in the U.S. However, if a physician recommends taking the drug, it is also possible to obtain the medication as a prescription so that it is available at a lower cost to the patient. The researchers compared children whose mothers had reported acetaminophen use during pregnancy or who obtained a prescription for use during pregnancy with children with no reported maternal use. They were able to follow children up for clinical diagnoses of autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability using a register of all specialist (and inpatient) care in Sweden. “When we compare children in the greater Swedish population, we saw the exact same sorts of associations that have been reported in other populations, with about a 26% increased risk of autism associated with acetaminophen use,” Lee stated. “However, when we controlled for different indications of acetaminophen use in the mother in our models, this risk was attenuated down to a 5-7% increased risk for each of the neurodevelopmental outcomes that we were interested in studying.” In addition, the researchers compared siblings who were exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy to those that were not exposed. “This sort of analysis helps us to control for genetics. Since other studies have shown that women with a higher genetic liability for neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD are more likely to report taking acetaminophen during pregnancy as well as to suffer from indications for use of pain-relievers during pregnancy, we felt that it was extremely important to understand this component,” Lee noted. For example, a mother who suffers from relatively frequent mild to moderate headaches may not end up seeking care or being treated by a specialist. In this case, they can capture data on indications for acetaminophen use. “By comparing siblings born to the same mother, we can control for many indications as well as early life environmental factors that might influence the relationship that we are studying. When we compared the full siblings, we saw no difference in risk between the exposed siblings and the unexposed siblings,” said Lee. Results showed no link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability in sibling control analysis. “This is a very well done, methodologically rigorous study,” Blake Turner, PhD, assistant professor of clinical social science in the department of psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. “The sibling control design effectively adjusts for many potential confounders that could plausibly be responsible for a spurious association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and risk of autism in offspring.” Turner continued: “Interestingly, even in the models without sibling control, the elevated odds for offspring autism were quite small, though were statistically significant because of the huge population sample. The fact that these modest associations disappeared in the sibling analysis provides convincing evidence that the associations documented in earlier research were due to unadjusted confounding.” Turner was not involved in the study. Despite previous claims that recommended avoiding acetaminophen, experts said it is safe to use and the best option for pregnancy pain and fever relief. Additionally, they recommend avoiding aspirin and ibuprofen. “The weight of the evidence suggests that, relative to other options, acetaminophen is probably the safest analgesic for women who are pregnant,” said Turner. “The FDA
advises against the use of aspirin and NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen sodium because of potential fetal kidney damage.” This new study suggests that acetaminophen is safe with respect to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). “There is some evidence that links [acetaminophen] use during pregnancy to offspring ADHD
,” Turner stated. “However, one needs to consider the risks of the conditions for which acetaminophen is taken. Prolonged maternal fever during pregnancy is itself a risk factor for autism in offspring
.” One past study
found a strong effect on ASD for untreated maternal fever, but no effect when treated with a fever reducer. Experts note that pain can also affect maternal mental health, which can also be a risk factor for child mental health problems. Therefore judicious use of acetaminophen for these indications seems appropriate, Turner noted. Acetaminophen during pregnancy was not linked with children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability in sibling control analysis, a new study showed. While prior research recommended avoiding acetaminophen during pregnancy, experts said it is safe to use and the best option for pain and fever relief. A child’s risk of developing autism, ADHD and intellectual disabilities are also attributable to various genetic and environmental factors."," A new study showed acetaminophen during pregnancy was not associated with children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability.

104,Here's How Often Low-Risk People Should Be Tested for Prostate Cancer,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/heres-how-often-low-risk-people-should-be-tested-for-prostate-cancer,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/doctor-patient-conversation-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 9, 2024",New research is helping to better inform patients and doctors about when it is appropriate to seek out PSA testing and subsequent screening. For…,"Novel research could change, and hopefully simplify recommendations and guidelines about a common prostate cancer screening tool. The widely used prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a simple but contentious test that has been the focus of an intense debate. While the PSA test has been shown to reduce prostate cancer mortality there are also harms of the test. In new research this month, scientists across the United States and Europe are signaling that it is time to reevaluate prostate cancer screening — and a simpler approach could be the best approach. The focus of numerous studies this month is prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, which has been a standard prostate cancer screening tool for decades. The test is a relatively non-invasive, simple blood test, which can be performed at a doctor’s office. However, the test is also controversial, leading to a significant rate of false positives, overtreatment, and other harms. Current prostate cancer screening recommendations
and benefits are not nearly as clear-cut as with other forms of cancer
. Experts believe that with new tools and data, there should be clearer guidance on the continued role of PSA testing in prostate cancer screening that will simultaneously drive down prostate cancer mortality while minimizing additional harms from the test. New research presented at the European Association of Urology Congress in Paris this month, indicates that for low-risk men, a blood test once every five years is sufficient. The study will be published later this month in the journal European Urology. Researchers released their findings from the PROBASE trial in order to better define categories of prostate cancer risk in mid-life, and how screening guidelines should apply to them. The PROBASE trial involved about 12,500 men between the ages of 45-50 to test different screening procedures for prostate cancer. Men were categorized into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories after a baseline PSA test. The PSA test measures prostate-specific antigen in the blood, a potential indicator of cancer. Those with higher scores were considered at greater risk. A PSA level of under 1.5 ng/ml was considered low risk,1.5-3ng/ml intermediate, and a PSA of 3 ng/ml or higher was categorized as high risk. Researchers instructed low-risk men to have an additional PSA test done 5 years onward. Medium-risk men were told to get the test in 2 years. Those with high risk received additional treatment, including an MRI scan and prostate biopsy. Almost none of the men in the low-risk group were subsequently diagnosed with cancer at the 5-year mark, indicating that one every 5 years is sufficient. Furthermore, they found that by increasing the low-risk threshold of the PSA test from 1.0 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml, they would also significantly cut down the number of people needing to seek additional screening. “This enlarges the group with very low risk by 20% to nearly 90% at age 45. And they only need to repeat the PSA test 5 years later. Further follow-up aims to show that 10 yearly re-testing may be possible in these 90% of middle aged men. This would tremendously improve the harms of screening by increasing the negative predictive value of PSA,” Peter Albers, MD, a Professor of Urology at the German Cancer Research Center, and one of the authors of the research, told Healthline. Two new studies in JAMA also looked at the effectiveness of PSA testing, and how it could potentially be used in concert with other screening tools to improve its accuracy. In the first article
, British researchers found that while PSA testing did improve prostate cancer mortality on the whole, the effect was limited. The study included more than 400,000 men who had not been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one was invited to receive a PSA test, while the other group didn’t receive the screening. In total, the group that received the PSA screen experienced less than one-tenth of a percent (0.09%) reduction in prostate cancer mortality after an average follow-up of 15 years. “Only a few less men who were invited for a PSA test died because of prostate cancer. There wasn’t much difference between the two groups,” Richard Martin, PhD, a Professor Clinical Epidemiology at University of Bristol, and lead author of the study, told Healthline. “There is an urgent need to find ways of detecting cancers that need treating early and to avoid the diagnosis of low risk cancers,” he added. Another study in JAMA
, published the same day, suggests that the use of a biomarker panel in addition to PSA testing, could offer greater benefits in terms of screening while reducing unnecessary treatment. More than 60,000 men took part in the Finnish study. Similar to the British research, men were assigned either to an experiment group receiving a PSA test, or a control group that did not. Men who had a PSA level of 3.0 ng/ml or higher were asked to undergo an additional biomarker test known as a 4-kallikrein panel blood test, which screens for high-risk prostate cancer. If they scored high enough on the panel, they would then continue on towards additional treatment, including an MRI, and if necessary, a biopsy. In an accompanying editorial
on the research, Jeffrey Tosoian, MD, MPH, an Assistant Professor of Urology and Director of Translational Cancer Research at at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, writes, “the current trial informs a more contemporary, pragmatic approach to screening, with appropriate use of biomarkers and imaging to optimize patient selection for biopsy.” This suggests that additional tools are ensuring that men with higher risk are getting additional treatment, while those with lower risk are not being subjected to unnecessary biopsies. “All the data coming out are telling us that, with the tools available today, we very much can, and are, reducing the, the harms that came along with PSA testing in a prior era really significantly, while still preserving the benefit in diagnosing the higher grade cancers that need to be detected and treated at an early stage,” Tosoian told Healthline. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men after skin cancer. About one-in-eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer
during their lifetime. In 2024 in the United States, there will be an estimated 300,000 new cases of prostate cancer per year, with about 35,000 deaths attributed to it. Globally, there are roughly 1.4 million new cases per year, but that number is expected to more than double to 2.9 million cases in 2040, according to The Lancet Commission on Prostate Cancer
report published this month. Unlike other forms of cancer, prostate cancer is typically slow-growing, so much so that a low-grade form of it may require no treatment during a man’s lifetime. Due to the risk of false positives and overdiagnosis, screening for prostate cancer, as well as specific guidelines about how and when it should be undertaken, is a complex issue. The American Cancer Society
and the US Preventive Services Task Force both recommend speaking with a doctor and making an informed decision about screening. Prostate cancer screening is a complex issue that men should discuss with their doctor to weigh the risks and benefits. New research is helping to better inform patients and doctors about when it is appropriate to seek out PSA testing and subsequent screening, such as MRI and biopsy. For low-risk men, a PSA test once every 5 years may be sufficient. Additional measures, such as biomarker tests may help to improve the accuracy of prostate cancer screening and improve recommendations about additional treatment."," The focus of numerous studies this month is prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, which has been a standard prostate cancer screening tool for decades.

While participants receiving semaglutide lost less weight than people without diabetes in an earlier trial, they saw similar benefits. This suggests the heart failure-related benefits of semaglutide may extend beyond those due to weight loss, say researchers. People with type 2 diabetes and a certain type of heart failure saw improvements in their symptoms and physical limitations after 1 year of semaglutide injections, new research shows. These benefits occurred even though this group of patients lost less weight than people without diabetes in a similar trial. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved
Wegovy for reducing the risk of serious heart problems in people who are overweight or have obesity. The findings suggest that semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, may offer heart-related benefits beyond those stemming from weight loss. “This is an important trial which reinforces the concept that patients with the syndrome of heart failure can benefit further from administration of a drug that was originally developed to reduce blood sugar, and has now emerged as an important way to reduce cardiovascular and heart failure events,” said Richard Wright, MD, cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., who was not involved in the new research. The findings were presented Apr. 6 at the American College of Cardiology 2024 Scientific Session in Atlanta, and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The new study included 616 people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which is a form of heart failure that occurs when the heart is unable to relax properly between each heartbeat, but can pump at a normal output, or ejection fraction. All participants also had obesity and type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either once-weekly semaglutide injections or an inactive placebo. People in the semaglutide group started at the lowest dose, which was then increased to a maintenance dose by week 16. After following participants for a year, researchers found that people in the semaglutide group lost more weight and had larger reductions in symptoms related to heart failure, compared to those in the placebo group. This included greater improvements in their quality of life and daily functioning, and being able to walk further on a 6-minute walking test. These kinds of physical improvements would allow people to more easily walk to a neighbor’s house or to a nearby grocery store, said Andrew Choi, MD, associate professor of medicine and radiology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, who was not involved in the research. Yu-Ming Ni, MD, a cardiologist and lipidologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, Calif., pointed out that a lack of mobility and physical activity can contribute to symptoms of heart failure, something that can be worsened by obesity. “We have known for many years that structured exercise improves heart failure outcomes,” said Ni, who was not involved in the new study. “So it doesn’t surprise me that this medication, with its impact on weight loss, can contribute to a reduction in heart failure symptoms.” However, while weight loss played a big part in the reduction in people’s symptoms, Ni said the drug may contribute in other ways, such as by reducing inflammation, which was suggested by some of the changes in biomarkers seen in the study. This included large reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP) and NT-proBNP levels among people receiving semaglutide. CRP levels are related to inflammation and can be an indicator of your risk of developing cardiovascular problems. NT-proBNP is a measure of the severity of heart failure and may be elevated in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The researchers agreed, writing that the findings “suggest that the mechanisms of benefit with semaglutide may extend beyond weight loss.” This may be due to the effects of the drug on the heart and blood vessels, inflammation, insulin resistance and other factors, they said. While people receiving semaglutide lost weight, as was expected, the weight reduction was 40% lower than what was seen by people with heart failure but not diabetes in an earlier trial. Choi said this lower weight loss in patients with diabetes is expected. Other glucose-lowering drugs that patients were taking — such as insulin or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — may “blunt” the weight loss effects of semaglutide, he told Healthline. Wright said the study “raises the important issue as to whether administration of a GLP-1 receptor agonist would have similar benefits in those individuals with heart failure but without obesity or diabetes.” This would need to be studied in future clinical trials. The average age of participants in the study was 69 years and almost half were women. Almost two-thirds had a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher, with people having diabetes for 8 years on average. In addition to diuretics, most participants were receiving other standard treatments, including renin-angiotensin system blockers and beta-blockers. Some were also on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and SGLT2 inhibitors. Approximately 15% of people in each group discontinued the study treatment early. In addition, 80% of the people in the semaglutide group who finished the trial were still on the weekly maintenance dose. In the placebo group, 18 patients were hospitalized or had an urgent visit related to heart failure, compared to seven patients in the semaglutide group. Certain adverse events occurred less often in the semaglutide group, including hypoglycemia and diabetic retinopathy. These are both complications of type 2 diabetes. Overall, 10.6% of participants in the semaglutide group stopped treatment early due to an adverse event, while 8.2% in the placebo group did. This included gastrointestinal disorders, which are a known side effect of GLP-1s. The study has some limitations, including the small number of participants and that researchers only followed people for one year. More study will be needed to verify the findings. However, “[the study] findings strongly support that a GLP-1 receptor agonist, such as semaglutide, should now be considered an important ‘fifth pillar’ of pharmacologic treatment of patients with heart failure and obesity,” Wright told Healthline, “even for those already on conventional pharmacologic treatments.” Although Ni agrees that weight loss can improve functioning and quality of life in people with heart failure, he questions whether a drug like semaglutide should be recommended for all patients with this condition. “I’m constantly telling my patients that weight loss can help with heart failure symptoms, but it doesn’t have to be with a medication,” he told Healthline. “A lot of my focus is on healthy lifestyle — exercise, diet and natural weight loss — as a means to improve heart failure outcomes.” Choi emphasized that while the use of semaglutide is growing, the medication should be used only for approved indications, which currently includes weight loss, treatment of diabetes and reducing heart-related risks in certain people. “In addition, strict adherence to a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise and gradual dose titration [of semaglutide] is important to avoid negative side effects,” he said. Researchers recruited over 600 people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), obesity and type 2 diabetes. They randomly assigned people to receive weekly injections of semaglutide (Wegovy) or an inactive placebo. After one year, people who had received semaglutide had greater improvements in quality of life and physical functioning, in addition to reductions in key biomarkers related to heart function. People also experienced fewer exacerbations requiring a doctor’s visit or hospitalization. People with heart failure and type 2 diabetes lost less weight on semaglutide compared to those in an earlier trial without diabetes. This, say researchers, suggests that semaglutide offers heart-related benefits beyond those involving weight loss."," People with type 2 diabetes and a certain type of heart failure saw improvements in their symptoms after 1 year of semaglutide injections, a new study shows. While participants receiving semaglutide lost less weight than people without diabetes in an earlier trial, they saw similar benefits. This suggests the heart failure-related benefits of semaglutide may extend beyond those due to weight loss, say researchers. People with type 2 diabetes and a certain type of heart failure saw improvements in their symptoms and physical limitations after 1 year of semaglutide injections, new research shows. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved Wegovy for reducing the risk of serious heart problems in people who are overweight or have obesity. The findings suggest that semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, may offer heart-related benefits beyond those stemming from weight loss."
106,Diagnosed with Colon Cancer at 7 Months Pregnant: How This Mom Navigated Treatment,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/colon-cancer-pregnant-treatment,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/amanda-webb-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 9, 2024",Amanda Webb’s life took an unexpected turn when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer while she was 31 weeks pregnant. Here’s how she navigated…,"Colorectal cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50 years old and the second leading cause of cancer death in females under 50. Amanda Webb shares her journey of being diagnosed with early-onset stage 4 colon cancer while seven months pregnant with her first child. Screenings, such as colonoscopy, can help prevent and detect colon cancer. While six months pregnant, Amanda Webb felt healthy and strong as she carried on her usual routine of running and biking. But a few weeks later, her life took a turn she never expected. Because she was 36 years old, she was considered an advanced age for pregnancy, which meant her doctors recommended genetic screening of the baby. The results initially suggested Trisomy 13, a rare chromosome abnormality in the baby. “Babies don’t typically live longer than a week with that and have severe medical issues, so for about a week, we grappled with the potential that we might have to terminate a wanted pregnancy,” Webb told Healthline. However, a follow-up test of her amniotic fluid showed that the baby was healthy. Her doctors informed her that sometimes cancer cells in a woman can cause false positives in a genetic screening test. Because a few years earlier Webb was diagnosed with stage IA malignant melanoma after having a mole removed, her doctors ordered further testing. She went to a melanoma clinic for a more in-depth mole check, but nothing concerning showed up. For extra precaution, the clinic ordered an MRI, which detected tumors on Webb’s liver. “Initially, they thought they were benign and possibly grew during pregnancy, but then things started to get really expedited,” Webb said. She was referred to a high risk obstetrician who admitted her to the hospital for a few days, so she could quickly undergo a CT scan, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and biopsy. On May 20, 2021, at 31 weeks pregnant, just shy of her 37th birthday, Webb was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. While a previous history of several cancers is associated with colon cancer, malignant melanoma is not a common one, said Carla Justiniano, MD, a colorectal surgeon at the University of Cincinnati Cancer Center and assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. “Being pregnant is really what found the cancer,” Webb said. Because Webb was far enough into her pregnancy, her doctors assured her that she could undergo the same treatment plan that she would if she weren’t pregnant. “I didn’t have to do what some pregnant women with cancer have to do in making a decision of starting treatment while pregnant, or finishing out the pregnancy first, or not finishing the pregnancy,” said Webb. Unlike women who are not pregnant, she received her first three chemotherapy treatments while staying in the hospital under the care of antepartum staff who monitored the baby. “Then I had my C-section to deliver Levi at about 37 weeks,” she said. Three weeks after her son was born, Webb had five more rounds of chemotherapy and then surgery, which removed the entire right lobe of her liver and 20% of her colon. She then underwent five more rounds of chemotherapy. “I feel really lucky and am absolutely amazed at what [my doctors] were able to accomplish in a matter of seven months,” said Webb. “I was undergoing treatment for months before I knew that a lot of people with stage 4 diagnosis aren’t treated to be cured when it comes to colorectal cancer; a lot of them are on chemo for life.” After finishing treatment while being a new mom, Webb said the adjustment to her new reality was more than she expected. “I thought after finishing treatment it would kind of be a flip of the switch, and things would go back to the way they were, and that was a joke on me,” she said. “After finishing treatment and being so used to being in fight mode, you’re released back into civilian life, but cancer is all the sudden a huge part of who you are. It was difficult to navigate that and unpack the trauma.” She found comfort on social media by following different nonprofits affiliated with colorectal cancer. Stories from others going through cancer, as well as survivors, brought her hope. “I wasn’t ready to be transparent on social media about what I was going through…but it was such a huge motivator for me to see these people who had gone through the good, bad, and the ugly,” said Webb. When the organization Fight Colorectal Cancer (Fight CRC) hosted a local northern California hike, she went. “I just felt like those are my people. Worst club; best members,” she said. In 2023, she went with Fight CRC to Washington DC, to participate in the Call-on Congress, which pushes policymakers to make changes regarding colorectal cancer. After she returned, she became a 2023–2024 ambassador for the organization. Since then, she went back to DC, led an annual colorectal cancer awareness run with her local run club, and shared her story to spread awareness. “For me, talking about it helps,” Webb said. “I’m not one to be front and center…but if getting on the stage makes people aware that this can happen to young people and pregnant women that consider themselves healthy, then I’ll do it.” With the American Cancer Society (ACS) reporting
that colorectal cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50 years old and the second leading cause of cancer death in women under 50, Webb takes to heart spreading awareness about early detection and benefits of early colonoscopies. “The issue with the early onset group is it’s tough for us to get the access to the screenings when we have symptoms,” she said. “People are getting diagnosed with IBS, and for some reason, a lot of people are being gaslighted by primary care providers instead of sent for a colonoscopy because everyone thinks it’s still in that older age group, and then we’re diagnosed at later stages.” In the years leading up to her diagnosis, she experienced minor symptoms, such as frequent bowel movements and not feeling like she fully emptied her bowel. She chalked these up to being a runner and having a high metabolism. When she brought the symptoms up to her primary care doctor, they suggested she cut out dairy. “You have to be your own advocate. You know yourself better than anyone else. Don’t take ‘no’ for an answer if you think you should have that colonoscopy,” she said. “It’s the poop cancer that people don’t want to talk about, but we shouldn’t have to have digestive issues, something can be done about it.” Colonoscopy still remains the standard of care and can be lifesaving, said Cathy Eng,MD, director of Fight CRC and director of the Young Adults Cancers Program at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center. “[Remember] 45 is the new screening age,” she told Healthline. “If you have a first-degree relative, please start screening 10 years earlier than your relative’s diagnosis. Also important for others to learn about their family history.” However, she added that while many people think colorectal cancer is hereditary, the majority of cases are sporadic. “[This] is likely explained by a birth cohort effect where only persons born after the 1950s experienced the increasing rates of colorectal cancer, meaning these people have had different exposures to foods and environmental factors that impact the microbiome and inflammation in their colon, which are thereby thought to drive carcinogenesis,” Justiniano told Healthline. Because early-stage colon cancer often doesn’t show any symptoms, she stressed the importance of screening. “Patients with a diagnosis, especially when caught at screening, are often in disbelief because they feel fine, but in fact, many colon cancer patients are caught early and have zero symptoms, which highlights the importance of a screening colonoscopy,” she said. When caught early, colon cancer is often curable. “There are many cancers that we cannot screen for, but colorectal cancer is not one of those, and thus we should be appreciative of that and take advantage of it,” said Justiniano. “If patients got their colonoscopies as per guidelines, the incidence of advanced or late-stage colorectal cancer among patients older than 45 should be much lower than it is now, and therefore survival would be much better.” Fight CRC offers a free, medically-reviewed colorectal cancer screening quiz, which can help assess your risk. It also provides guidance on how to discuss screening options with your doctor."," “Babies don’t typically live longer than a week with that and have severe medical issues, so for about a week, we grappled with the potential that we might have to terminate a wanted pregnancy,” Webb told Healthline. “Being pregnant is really what found the cancer,” Webb said. “I didn’t have to do what some pregnant women with cancer have to do in making a decision of starting treatment while pregnant, or finishing out the pregnancy first, or not finishing the pregnancy,” said Webb."
107,"Stevia and Other Non-Sugar Sweeteners May Not Increase Appetite Levels, Study Finds",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/stevia-and-other-non-sugar-sweeteners-may-not-increase-appetite-levels-study-finds,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soda-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 8, 2024",A new study finds that non-sugar sweeteners like stevia may not increase appetite.,"A recent study indicates that replacing sugar with sweeteners like stevia does not increase appetite levels They also found these non-sugar sweeteners may reduce blood sugar and insulin response after eating Previous concerns about sweeteners increasing appetite were not based on robust evidence. A new study
suggests that replacing sugar with sweeteners does not cause an increase in appetite – contrary to previous studies of lower quality. The researchers studied 53 healthy adults as the latest study to be published by the SWEET consortium of 29 European research, consumer, and industry partners. The study was recently published in eBioMedcine
. The SWEET consortium is dedicated to researching and evaluating the long-term advantages and drawbacks associated with transitioning to sweeteners and sweetness enhancers within the realms of public health and safety, obesity, and sustainability. The researchers looked at how people’s appetites changed after eating foods with sugar versus non-sugar sweeteners. This study included 53 healthy adults with a body mass index (BMI) 25–35. A person with a BMI over 25 is considered as having overweight, if it is over 30 they are considered as having obesity. Participants were ages 18-60 and were randomly assigned to eat one of three types of cookies (called biscuits in the study). One group consumed a portion of cookies containing sucrose (sugar), while the other two groups consumed cookies with sweeteners (stevia or neotame) every day for two weeks. This was followed by a two-week washout period where participants returned to their regular diets. Stevia is a naturally occurring sugar substitute made from a stevia plant. Neotame is an artificial sweetener sold under the brand name Newtame that is 13,000 times sweeter than table sugar. Afterward, the individuals in the study were assigned to another group of cookies, and the cycle repeated for a total of three rounds. This ensured that each participant tried all three types of cookies but in a different order. Researchers found no difference in appetite levels between those who consumed sucrose and those who consumed the other sweeteners. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between satiety-related hormones like ghrelin, GLP-1, or pancreatic polypeptide (PP). These were measured immediately after eating and at various intervals thereafter, on day 1 and day 14 of each cookie consumption period.  Researchers also observed the impact that sugar vs. sweeteners had on blood sugar and insulin levels after eating. Overall, participants who consumed sweeteners had a lower insulin response than those who consumed sugar. However, the blood sugar results differed based on type of sweetener. While both stevia and neotame showed reduced blood sugar response compared to sugar, only stevia showed a significant difference. This is the first of its kind study to investigate the impact of consuming food containing either sugar or two types of food sweeteners. Prior research has predominantly focused
on beverages
. But these types of studies are limited since unlike beverages eating solid food will have different impacts on digestion, satiety and post-meal responses. This study was a highly-controlled, gold-standard design that was conducted over a minimum 70-day study period. Very few studies in the past have examined the effects of repeated daily consumption of sweeteners as part of a regular diet. Finally, this study included volunteers with a BMI of 25–35 and participants of both sexes. However, the study is relatively small with only 53 individuals studied, so more research will be needed to verify these findings. It depends on how “healthy” is defined. In terms of blood sugar and insulin response, there is strong evidence to suggest that choosing non-sugar sweeteners has a favorable effect. This is found in both food and beverages. A 2023 review and meta-analysis
of earlier studies found that non-nutritive sweeteners with single or blends had no immediate metabolic and endocrine effects, similar to water. “Reducing sugar consumption has become a key public health target in the fight to reduce the rising burden of obesity-related metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes,” the study authors stated. High blood sugar and insulin responses play a role in developing metabolic disease, though risk assessment is not a “one-size-fits-all” approach. Regardless, this is a valuable finding to improve the health status of individuals. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a new guideline
that recommends against the use of non-sugar sweeteners (NSS), also known as non-nutritive sweeteners, to control body weight or reduce the risk of noncommunicable diseases. Julie Stefanski MEd, RDN, LDN, FAND, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics
told Healthline that every person is different and that even the same food product or sugar substitute may have varied impacts on different people. “The use of a nonnutritive sweetener is only a very small piece of an overall dietary pattern and physical activity routine. Each person choosing to use a food product that contains a nonnutritive sweetener versus traditional sources of sugar needs to assess whether it meets their health goals, whether weight-focused or aiming for better blood glucose control,” Stefanski said. Researchers randomly assigned participants to eat cookies with sucrose or one of two types of sweeteners every day for two weeks. The results showed that there was no difference in appetite after sugar or sweetener consumption. However, blood sugar and insulin responses were lower after eating sweeteners. This suggests that consuming foods with sweeteners instead of sugar may be a tool to help with lowering blood sugar and insulin levels. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and the impact on long-term health."," A recent study indicates that replacing sugar with sweeteners like stevia does not increase appetite levels They also found these non-sugar sweeteners may reduce blood sugar and insulin response after eating Previous concerns about sweeteners increasing appetite were not based on robust evidence.

Researchers classified individuals into four diet patterns. These patterns were reduced starch, vegetarian, high protein and low fiber, and balanced. Starch-free or reduced starch Vegetarian High protein and low fiber Balanced Cardiovascular disease-related death Anxiety and common mental health conditions Type 2 diabetes Obesity Sleep disorders Depression The old adage about following a balanced diet is mostly known for its positive physical benefits, but a new study suggests that such eating habits have significant effects on mental health and cognition. A new study, published in Nature Mental Health
this month, examined the food-liking patterns and dietary preferences of more than 180,000 adults in the United Kingdom and broke those patterns into four categories: More than half of the people surveyed fell into the “balanced” category, and their reported mental health outcomes and cognitive function were better than any of the other three. Those who followed the high-protein/low-fiber diet had lower gray matter volumes in a part of the brain called the postcentral gyrus, which coordinates how our body moves through the environment, than those who followed a balanced diet. Additionally, the people who were vegetarian had higher gray matter volumes in part of the brain called the thalamus and precuneus. Notably, the study found an increased risk of mental health issues in those who consumed more vegetables and fruits, a finding the authors explained could be due to the design of their study and requires further study.  Highly processed foods have been found to contribute to a wide variety of health issues, including: Diets like the Mediterranean diet, which has an emphasis on fish and vegetables, have shown promising effects on physical health. But diets that aid in reducing inflammation can also have a significant impact on brain health and mental health, according to Molly Rapozo, RDN, Registered Dietician Nutritionist & Senior Nutrition and Health Educator at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA, who was not involved in the study. “Diets characterized by high intakes of antioxidant rich vegetables and fruit, limited meat consumption, and use of anti-inflammatory olive oil as a primary fat source are associated with decreased dementia risk. For instance, adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, which is high in plant-based foods and low in high-saturated fat foods, has been linked to improved cognitive function and larger brain volumes in specific regions,” Rapozo told Healthline. Rapozo also said that diets high in saturated fats, sugars, and refined carbohydrates have been associated with decreased cognitive function and brain volume. “The impact of diet on the gut microbiome also plays a significant role in brain health, with evidence suggesting that a healthy gut, promoted by diets rich in dietary fiber, may preserve the gut-brain axis and potentially improve cognition,” Rapozo said. By creating balance in eating habits, the study suggests, people can lay a foundation for better mental health and cognition. Lifestyle choices are also a significant factor, Rapozo said, citing quality sleep, regular exercise, and good stress-management techniques as essential to supplement a balanced diet. Rapozo said the study was “exciting” in part because it was such a large study with over 181,000 participants and had a significant amount of data involved. “It was also found that high protein, low fiber diets with an emphasis on snack foods were associated with lower well-being scores, higher levels of inflammatory markers, and an increased stroke risk. These findings appear to agree with what we already know about diet and brain health,” Rapozo said. “We can modify our diets to improve brain health by Including vegetables, fruit, starches such as whole grains, legumes, and potatoes; as well as lean protein, fatty fish, and plant fats such as nuts, seeds, avocado, olives, and olive oil. Eat less highly processed snack foods, fatty meats including bacon and sausage, sugar, and other refined carbohydrates.” Diets like paleo, keto, and Whole 30 all focus on less of a particular nutrient, like carbohydrates, but are not intended to be followed for long periods of time, Melanie Murphy Richter, a registered dietitian nutritionist and the director of communications for the nutrition company Prolon, who was not involved in the study, told Healthline. “A strict keto diet with little to no carbohydrates can add significant stress and inflammation to the body and cause a variety of nutritional deficiencies and potential poor health outcomes. The Whole 30 diet is actually phase one of a larger food auditioning plan for people to learn their food intolerances. Many people start and stop at Whole 30, and never go on to the actual food auditioning that it was designed to prep your body for,” Richter said. “Most people struggle to understand what ‘balanced’ means and so they aren’t aware of how to get all the nutrients they need within the parameters of these diets. But it’s possible! For vegans, prioritizing plant-based proteins like legumes, lentils, tofu, beans, nuts, seeds, and peas will help ensure they meet the proper protein criteria without animal meats or dairy. It’s also important not to use veganism as an excuse to eat loads of vegan processed foods, as many people do.” Rapozo echoed a similar path for her clients, saying that specific diets of restriction are targeting specific goals, but that people should look at longer-term ideals for how they eat. “Special diets are implemented to gain desired results such as weight loss, avoidance of food allergens, personal values, etc. When working with clients my goal is to help people make their meal plans as brain healthy as possible,” Rapozo said. “For instance, keto can emphasize plant fats, lean protein, and fatty fish instead of high saturated fat sources. Vegan diets can be more balanced with plant proteins from legumes, soy, nuts, and seeds. Once client goals are met, I encourage the inclusion of a greater variety of foods.” A new study of more than 180,000 people in the UK suggests that a balanced diet, which does not restrict specific foods, is associated with better mental health and cognitive function. By focusing less on a diet of restrictions, experts say, a better overall cognitive outcome can be made possible. But lifestyle choices, like sleep quality, exercise, and stress management, are also important factors to mental health and cognition."," Starch-free or reduced starch Vegetarian High protein and low fiber Balanced Cardiovascular disease-related death Anxiety and common mental health conditions Type 2 diabetes Obesity Sleep disorders Depression The old adage about following a balanced diet is mostly known for its positive physical benefits, but a new study suggests that such eating habits have significant effects on mental health and cognition.

Lauren Boebert Treated for Blood Clot, Diagnosed with May-Thurner Syndrome",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/lauren-boebert-may-thurner-syndrome,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Lauren-Boebert-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 5, 2024",Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has been diagnosed with May-Thurner Syndrome following her hospitalization for a blood clot. Here's what to know about…,"Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has been diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome, a vascular abnormality in the pelvis. The discovery was made following her hospitalization for a blood clot. Boebert has undergone surgery for the clot and is making a full recovery Leg pain Leg swelling Skin discoloration Leg ulcers Enlarged veins Severe foot and ankle pain Affected skin that feels warmer than the surrounding area Leg cramps Skin discoloration, turning pale, reddish, or bluish United States Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has been diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome, an uncommon vascular condition, after having a blood clot removed from her leg. In May-Thurner syndrome
, arteries in the pelvis become compressed, leading to blood flow problems and, potentially, blood clots in the left leg. Boebert’s surgery was a success, and she is making a full recovery. However, her ordeal has brought attention to a condition that may, in fact, be more widespread than previously believed. According to a statement from Boebert’s campaign on April 3, the 37-year-old Congresswoman from Colorado was admitted to the UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies for “severe swelling in her upper left leg.” Doctors identified an acute blood clot using a CT scan and subsequently diagnosed Boebert with May-Thurner syndrome. The following day she underwent surgery to remove the clot and insert a stent. Although it’s unclear what the exact cause of the clot was, Boebert’s team cited “dehydration, travel, and extended periods of sitting” as potential factors. “After taking time to rest as recommended by doctors, she is expected to make a full recovery with no significant concerns for her long-term health and no hindrance to her ability to perform her duties as a Congresswoman,” the statement said. Lawrence “Rusty” Hofmann, MD, a Professor and Chief of Interventional Radiology at Stanford Medicine who has spent 20 years studying May-Thurner syndrome, told Healthline that what Boebert experienced is “pretty typical.” “She presented with an acute deep venous thrombosis, and that is a blood clot that can occur in any of your deep veins in your arms, legs, or pelvis, and cause swelling and pain. That by itself is very rarely severely dangerous, but the real worry is that these clots can break off, go to your lung,” he said. May-Thurner syndrome is a condition in which the right common iliac artery (the primary blood vessel carrying blood to the right leg) compresses the left iliac vein (the primary blood vessel carrying blood from the left leg to the heart), which can result in blood flow problems and blood clots. It was first described in 1957 by its namesake, Dr. May and Dr. Thurner. “It’s a normal variant in which they noticed that the artery that goes to the right leg compresses the vein to the left leg,” said Hofmann, “They defined it as when the vein is compressed by fifty percent.” Hofmann calls it a “normal variant” because it is believed to be present in individuals without symptoms, who may go their whole lives without it becoming a serious health issue. “If you have May-Thurner syndrome and no symptoms, you do not need any medicine or any procedures. It is just how you were ‘put together at the factory,’” he said. Estimates vary on how common May-Thurner syndrome is, however, because it is often only diagnosed in association with deep vein thrombosis, as in the case of Boebert. Some estimates indicate that one in five people
experience iliac vein compression but don’t have a formal diagnosis of May-Thurner syndrome. Other research
puts the number between 14 and 32% of the general population. While some may never have symptoms of May-Thurner syndrome, it can manifest through various symptoms, including: Of greater concern is the potential for deep-vein thrombosis, which is when a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins of the leg. Research indicates that May-Thurner syndrome may be responsible for between 2 and 5% of all deep vein thrombosis. Symptoms of deep-vein thrombosis include: Deep-vein thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism, a serious and potentially fatal condition in which the blood clot that has formed in the leg travels to the lungs. “If you get a big blood clot, like the type that would kill you, you are going to know. It’s going to be, ‘Oh, my leg is almost twice the size of my other leg, and it hurts like crazy, and I need to go to the emergency room,’” said Hofmann. May-Thurner syndrome may require no treatment at all unless it leads to deep vein thrombosis. Doctors typically use imaging tools such as CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds to check for blood clots and compression. If a patient is determined to have May-Thurner syndrome or an acute blood clot, they will determine a course of action. Treatment may require hospitalization and surgery. “The blood clot, if you don’t fix this properly, you’re at an increased risk for blood clots for life. What we do to treat this is we go in, and we use either drugs or a device to suck the blood clot out and clean up the vein,” said Hofmann. To lower future risk of blood clots, blood-thinning medications are commonly prescribed. In some cases, a doctor may elect for a surgical procedure such as removal of the iliac artery or bypass surgery
. More commonly, to prevent future blood flow problems, doctors may insert a stent into the affected vein or artery. “[A stent] is basically curative. I have patients that are twenty or twenty-five years out and have never had another blood clot. They are not on blood thinners, and they’re doing great,” said Hofmann.

The risk to the general public remains low, because there is no sign of person-to-person transmission of the virus. eye redness flu-like upper respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose pneumonia fever muscle or body aches headaches fatigue difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Avoid direct contact with wild birds, or with wild or domestic birds that appear sick or have died. Avoid unprotected exposure to infected live or dead animals, including cattle, domestic pets, and other mammals. To move or discard a dead bird or other animal, don’t touch it with your bare hands. Use gloves or a plastic bag to place the body inside a garbage bag. Wash your hands with soap and water after exposure to wild birds or other animals, as well as domesticated farm animals. A person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu after close contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected, health officials said Apr. 1. The person’s only symptom is eye inflammation, and they are being treated with the antiviral drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir), Texas health officials said. The risk to the public “remains low,” they added. This is the second person in the United States to test positive for H5N1 bird flu, and the first case linked to exposure to cattle, federal health officials said. A previous human case
of bird flu occurred in Colorado in 2022, in a person who had contact with infected poultry. There is no evidence of person-to-person spread of the virus, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told AP News. Genetic tests
carried out by the CDC on samples from the patient in Texas and infected cattle show that the virus lacks changes that would make it better able to infect mammals. There is also no sign that the virus has developed resistance to antiviral treatments, the CDC said. The tests also suggest that the infection in the patient involves the eyes, but perhaps not the upper respiratory tract. In late March, dairy cows in Kansas and Texas tested positive for bird flu. Since then, the outbreak has spread to additional herds in New Mexico and Ohio. Federal agriculture officials emphasized that the food supply remains safe. Milk from sick cows is diverted or destroyed, and pasteurization kills any viruses or bacteria in milk. Bird flu is a disease caused by an influenza virus that mainly infects birds. These types of viruses, known as avian influenza A viruses
, spread naturally among wild aquatic birds such as ducks and geese. From there, they can pass to chickens and other domesticated poultry. There are two groups of these viruses: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The second group causes severe disease and high death rates in infected birds. This group includes the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus — aka H5N1 bird flu — detected in cattle and the patient in Texas. Certain bird flu viruses can spread to and infect mammals
, including seals, bears, foxes, skunks, domestic cats and dogs, and humans
. “People who are at risk are those who have direct and prolonged exposure with infected, ill or dead animals, or areas contaminated by infected birds or animals,” said Dean Blumberg, MD, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children’s Hospital. It is rare for bird flu viruses to spread from an infected person to another person, but it has happened. In these cases
, the virus has spread to only a few people, and often within a person’s household, where there is prolonged, close contact. “Human-to-human transmission is extraordinarily rare,” Blumberg told Healthline, “and in fact there is no risk of sustained human-to-human transmission, so this [virus] poses no threat to the general public.” The federal government maintains a stockpile
of vaccines, including ones that target H5N1 and H7N9 bird flu viruses. These could be mobilized if there are signs of human-to-human spread of the virus. However, Blumberg said the chance of that happening right now is low. “It would be concerning if avian influenza evolved to be more easily transmitted among people, since [we have] little to no immunity to this virus,” he said. “However this has not happened since bird flu was first described almost 150 years ago.” Symptoms
of bird flu in people range from mild to severe, and may include: As of December 2023, 902 people
have been infected with avian influenza H5N1 virus worldwide in 23 countries, reports the CDC. More than 50% of people died as a result of their infection. However, the severity of the cases varied depending upon the genetic characteristics of the virus involved, ranging from causing no symptoms to leading to severe illness and death. With only one human case in the recent outbreak associated with dairy cattle, it is too soon to know if all cases will be mild like the first one. Health officials are closely watching the situation. To protect yourself and your pets from bird flu, the CDC recommends
: If you find a dead bird, check with your state health department, state veterinary diagnostic laboratory, or state wildlife agency to find out how to report it. In addition, “for those who work in the [animal] industry and do have contact with potentially infectious animals and environments, full personal protective equipment) should be used including goggles, N95 or equivalent, gown, gloves, hair and boot covers,” said Blumberg. The CDC also recommends that you get a seasonal flu vaccine. This won’t protect you from bird flu, but will reduce your risk of getting seasonal flu and bird flu at the same time. Health officials reported that a person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu after close contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus. The person’s only symptom is eye inflammation. Tests by the CDC suggest that the infection in the patient may only involve the eyes, not the upper respiratory tract. While bird flu virus is known to spread from wild and domesticated birds to mammals, including people, this is the first case in a person that involves exposure to infected cattle."," This is the second person to test positive for H5N1 bird flu in the United States, and the first case linked to exposure to cattle. eye redness flu-like upper respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose pneumonia fever muscle or body aches headaches fatigue difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Avoid direct contact with wild birds, or with wild or domestic birds that appear sick or have died.

111,Why Diet and Fitness Influencers Are Telling People to Eat Sticks of Butter,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-diet-and-fitness-influencers-are-telling-people-to-eat-sticks-of-butter,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/butter-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 5, 2024",Diet and fitness influencers are encouraging people to eat sticks of butter as part of low carb eating plans like the carnivore diet. Here’s how that…,"People on social media are snacking on butter as part of the carnivore diet. Proponents claim it aids weight loss by contributing to feelings of fullness and has other wellbeing benefits like improved mood and energy. However, dietitians don’t recommend it and warn that snacking on butter can contribute to heart problems, nutrient deficiencies, and gut issues. Healthier snack options include nuts, seeds, fruit, and vegetables. Social media is often where weird and potentially dangerous health advice gains traction. The latest in a long line of questionable – and often harmful – nutrition trends is snacking on sticks of butter. Snacking on sticks of butter has become a popular practice among some TikTok creators following the carnivore diet. The carnivore diet involves eating only animal-based products – like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy – excluding plant-based foods, with some people claiming it can aid with weight loss. The aim is to consume zero carbs. In one video on the social media platform, TikTok creator @steakandbuttergirl is seen biting into a stick of butter while sharing that she eats butter every day for “happy hormones, great skin, energy and mood.” Many users on the app also snack on sticks of butter as a weight loss tactic, with some using butter as a meal replacement. However, butter is an unconventional weight-loss food, and overconsumption of it is associated with a number of poor health outcomes. Here two dietitians explain why snacking on butter is not a healthy choice. Paediatric dietitian Emma Shafqat says this trend is concerning because butter is very high in saturated fat and calories, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems. “While fat is an essential part of our diet, it’s all about moderation,” she points out. “It’s important that our meals are balanced, and we consume food in the five main food groups to ensure that we get all the essential nutrients that our body needs to stay healthy.” Shafqat says that the high saturated fat content found in butter may increase your LDL cholesterol and, therefore, your risk of heart disease. What’s more, she says many people are already over-consuming saturated fat, and snacking on butter won’t help matters. “Men should not eat more than 30g of saturated fat a day, and women should not eat more than 20g,” she points out. A 2014 study
found that higher saturated fat intake was associated with higher obesity and body mass index (BMI) scores. Registered dietitian nutritionist Claire Rifkin says that fat is the most calorie-dense nutrient. It’s also true that fats are essential for satiety, helping to quell hunger. “This likely leads some to believe that consuming sticks of butter can efficiently meet a significant portion of their caloric needs while also maintaining feelings of fullness,” she explains. “However, the reality is that simply consuming a stick of saturated fat, which lacks fiber-rich carbohydrates and protein, is unlikely to provide lasting satiety.” Low fiber isn’t only a problem because you’ll likely be left feeling hungry. “Without enough fiber in your diet, you might experience constipation,” Shafqat points out. “Low-fiber diets are also linked
to increased prevalence of gut diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, type 1 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome.” Rifkin shares similar concerns. “The absence of dietary fiber can negatively impact gut microbiota and digestion, leading to constipation and, in more severe cases, colon cancer, which is on the rise in young people.” When you routinely reach for a stick of butter over healthier snack options, like a piece of fruit or some vegetables, for example, you also increase your risk of nutrient deficiencies. “A diet consisting of just animal foods may be low in vitamins that are often obtained from plant foods,” Shafqat examples. She points to a 2018 study
that showed a high-animal protein and a low carbohydrate diet was low in B₁, D, E, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, nutrients that contribute to your overall health. One vitamin of particular concern, according to Shafqat, is vitamin C. “Meats are not a good source of vitamin C, and if you aren’t consuming enough of it, it can result in scurvy.” The carnivore diet isn’t considered a healthy eating style, and there is no evidence to support claims that it can eliminate certain health issues. What’s more, eliminating plant-based food sources could make it difficult for you to consume adequate amounts of nutrients that are important for health. However, if you’re someone who likes to eat a predominately animal-based diet, how can you do so in a healthier way? Shafqat says it’s essential that anyone following this diet add micronutrient-rich foods or supplements to reduce the risk of deficiency in this diet. That will mean taking a less rigid approach to the carnivore diet, but it could be better for your health in the long term. It’s a good idea to swap out that stick of butter for a nutrient-rich snack, like carrot sticks, crunchy bell peppers, or even an orange, to up your intake of vitamin C. You shouldn’t ever use butter as a meal replacement. Instead, Shafqat recommends healthier swaps like oily fish and eggs. “Eggs provide choline, folate, vitamin D, iodine, B vitamins, and high quality protein, while oily fish is a healthy source of omega-3,” she explains. Meanwhile, Rifkin says you should consider snacking on nuts and seeds instead. “A handful of mixed nuts and seeds, such as almonds, cashews, and pumpkin seeds, offers a convenient, portable snack option that’s rich in beneficial fats,” she notes. “Unlike the saturated fats found in butter, the fats in nuts and seeds are the healthy type of fat that actually supports heart health.” Butter isn’t a healthy snack option, and consuming it regularly as part of the carnivore diet can increase your risk of heart disease, nutrient deficiencies, and other health problems. If you must consume a predominately animal-based diet, it’s better to take a more flexible approach, swapping sticks of butter for healthier snacks like nuts, fruit, and vegetables."," However, dietitians don’t recommend it and warn that snacking on butter can contribute to heart problems, nutrient deficiencies, and gut issues.
