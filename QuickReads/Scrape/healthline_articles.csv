101,Here's How Often Low-Risk People Should Be Tested for Prostate Cancer,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/heres-how-often-low-risk-people-should-be-tested-for-prostate-cancer,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/doctor-patient-conversation-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 9, 2024",New research is helping to better inform patients and doctors about when it is appropriate to seek out PSA testing and subsequent screening. For…,"Novel research could change, and hopefully simplify recommendations and guidelines about a common prostate cancer screening tool. The widely used prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a simple but contentious test that has been the focus of an intense debate. While the PSA test has been shown to reduce prostate cancer mortality there are also harms of the test. In new research this month, scientists across the United States and Europe are signaling that it is time to reevaluate prostate cancer screening — and a simpler approach could be the best approach. The focus of numerous studies this month is prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, which has been a standard prostate cancer screening tool for decades. The test is a relatively non-invasive, simple blood test, which can be performed at a doctor’s office. However, the test is also controversial, leading to a significant rate of false positives, overtreatment, and other harms. Current prostate cancer screening recommendations
and benefits are not nearly as clear-cut as with other forms of cancer
. Experts believe that with new tools and data, there should be clearer guidance on the continued role of PSA testing in prostate cancer screening that will simultaneously drive down prostate cancer mortality while minimizing additional harms from the test. New research presented at the European Association of Urology Congress in Paris this month, indicates that for low-risk men, a blood test once every five years is sufficient. The study will be published later this month in the journal European Urology. Researchers released their findings from the PROBASE trial in order to better define categories of prostate cancer risk in mid-life, and how screening guidelines should apply to them. The PROBASE trial involved about 12,500 men between the ages of 45-50 to test different screening procedures for prostate cancer. Men were categorized into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories after a baseline PSA test. The PSA test measures prostate-specific antigen in the blood, a potential indicator of cancer. Those with higher scores were considered at greater risk. A PSA level of under 1.5 ng/ml was considered low risk,1.5-3ng/ml intermediate, and a PSA of 3 ng/ml or higher was categorized as high risk. Researchers instructed low-risk men to have an additional PSA test done 5 years onward. Medium-risk men were told to get the test in 2 years. Those with high risk received additional treatment, including an MRI scan and prostate biopsy. Almost none of the men in the low-risk group were subsequently diagnosed with cancer at the 5-year mark, indicating that one every 5 years is sufficient. Furthermore, they found that by increasing the low-risk threshold of the PSA test from 1.0 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml, they would also significantly cut down the number of people needing to seek additional screening. “This enlarges the group with very low risk by 20% to nearly 90% at age 45. And they only need to repeat the PSA test 5 years later. Further follow-up aims to show that 10 yearly re-testing may be possible in these 90% of middle aged men. This would tremendously improve the harms of screening by increasing the negative predictive value of PSA,” Peter Albers, MD, a Professor of Urology at the German Cancer Research Center, and one of the authors of the research, told Healthline. Two new studies in JAMA also looked at the effectiveness of PSA testing, and how it could potentially be used in concert with other screening tools to improve its accuracy. In the first article
, British researchers found that while PSA testing did improve prostate cancer mortality on the whole, the effect was limited. The study included more than 400,000 men who had not been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one was invited to receive a PSA test, while the other group didn’t receive the screening. In total, the group that received the PSA screen experienced less than one-tenth of a percent (0.09%) reduction in prostate cancer mortality after an average follow-up of 15 years. “Only a few less men who were invited for a PSA test died because of prostate cancer. There wasn’t much difference between the two groups,” Richard Martin, PhD, a Professor Clinical Epidemiology at University of Bristol, and lead author of the study, told Healthline. “There is an urgent need to find ways of detecting cancers that need treating early and to avoid the diagnosis of low risk cancers,” he added. Another study in JAMA
, published the same day, suggests that the use of a biomarker panel in addition to PSA testing, could offer greater benefits in terms of screening while reducing unnecessary treatment. More than 60,000 men took part in the Finnish study. Similar to the British research, men were assigned either to an experiment group receiving a PSA test, or a control group that did not. Men who had a PSA level of 3.0 ng/ml or higher were asked to undergo an additional biomarker test known as a 4-kallikrein panel blood test, which screens for high-risk prostate cancer. If they scored high enough on the panel, they would then continue on towards additional treatment, including an MRI, and if necessary, a biopsy. In an accompanying editorial
on the research, Jeffrey Tosoian, MD, MPH, an Assistant Professor of Urology and Director of Translational Cancer Research at at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, writes, “the current trial informs a more contemporary, pragmatic approach to screening, with appropriate use of biomarkers and imaging to optimize patient selection for biopsy.” This suggests that additional tools are ensuring that men with higher risk are getting additional treatment, while those with lower risk are not being subjected to unnecessary biopsies. “All the data coming out are telling us that, with the tools available today, we very much can, and are, reducing the, the harms that came along with PSA testing in a prior era really significantly, while still preserving the benefit in diagnosing the higher grade cancers that need to be detected and treated at an early stage,” Tosoian told Healthline. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men after skin cancer. About one-in-eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer
during their lifetime. In 2024 in the United States, there will be an estimated 300,000 new cases of prostate cancer per year, with about 35,000 deaths attributed to it. Globally, there are roughly 1.4 million new cases per year, but that number is expected to more than double to 2.9 million cases in 2040, according to The Lancet Commission on Prostate Cancer
report published this month. Unlike other forms of cancer, prostate cancer is typically slow-growing, so much so that a low-grade form of it may require no treatment during a man’s lifetime. Due to the risk of false positives and overdiagnosis, screening for prostate cancer, as well as specific guidelines about how and when it should be undertaken, is a complex issue. The American Cancer Society
and the US Preventive Services Task Force both recommend speaking with a doctor and making an informed decision about screening. Prostate cancer screening is a complex issue that men should discuss with their doctor to weigh the risks and benefits. New research is helping to better inform patients and doctors about when it is appropriate to seek out PSA testing and subsequent screening, such as MRI and biopsy. For low-risk men, a PSA test once every 5 years may be sufficient. Additional measures, such as biomarker tests may help to improve the accuracy of prostate cancer screening and improve recommendations about additional treatment."," The focus of numerous studies this month is prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, which has been a standard prostate cancer screening tool for decades.

102,Wegovy Can Help Reduce Heart Failure Symptoms Even When People Don't Lose as Much Weight,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/wegovy-can-help-reduce-heart-failure-symptoms-even-when-people-dont-lose-as-much-weight,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/female-running-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 9, 2024","A new study finds people taking semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, were able to reduce symptoms of heart failure even if they didn't lose a…","People with type 2 diabetes and a certain type of heart failure saw improvements in their symptoms after 1 year of semaglutide injections, a new study shows. While participants receiving semaglutide lost less weight than people without diabetes in an earlier trial, they saw similar benefits. This suggests the heart failure-related benefits of semaglutide may extend beyond those due to weight loss, say researchers. People with type 2 diabetes and a certain type of heart failure saw improvements in their symptoms and physical limitations after 1 year of semaglutide injections, new research shows. These benefits occurred even though this group of patients lost less weight than people without diabetes in a similar trial. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved
Wegovy for reducing the risk of serious heart problems in people who are overweight or have obesity. The findings suggest that semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, may offer heart-related benefits beyond those stemming from weight loss. “This is an important trial which reinforces the concept that patients with the syndrome of heart failure can benefit further from administration of a drug that was originally developed to reduce blood sugar, and has now emerged as an important way to reduce cardiovascular and heart failure events,” said Richard Wright, MD, cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., who was not involved in the new research. The findings were presented Apr. 6 at the American College of Cardiology 2024 Scientific Session in Atlanta, and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The new study included 616 people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which is a form of heart failure that occurs when the heart is unable to relax properly between each heartbeat, but can pump at a normal output, or ejection fraction. All participants also had obesity and type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either once-weekly semaglutide injections or an inactive placebo. People in the semaglutide group started at the lowest dose, which was then increased to a maintenance dose by week 16. After following participants for a year, researchers found that people in the semaglutide group lost more weight and had larger reductions in symptoms related to heart failure, compared to those in the placebo group. This included greater improvements in their quality of life and daily functioning, and being able to walk further on a 6-minute walking test. These kinds of physical improvements would allow people to more easily walk to a neighbor’s house or to a nearby grocery store, said Andrew Choi, MD, associate professor of medicine and radiology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, who was not involved in the research. Yu-Ming Ni, MD, a cardiologist and lipidologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, Calif., pointed out that a lack of mobility and physical activity can contribute to symptoms of heart failure, something that can be worsened by obesity. “We have known for many years that structured exercise improves heart failure outcomes,” said Ni, who was not involved in the new study. “So it doesn’t surprise me that this medication, with its impact on weight loss, can contribute to a reduction in heart failure symptoms.” However, while weight loss played a big part in the reduction in people’s symptoms, Ni said the drug may contribute in other ways, such as by reducing inflammation, which was suggested by some of the changes in biomarkers seen in the study. This included large reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP) and NT-proBNP levels among people receiving semaglutide. CRP levels are related to inflammation and can be an indicator of your risk of developing cardiovascular problems. NT-proBNP is a measure of the severity of heart failure and may be elevated in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The researchers agreed, writing that the findings “suggest that the mechanisms of benefit with semaglutide may extend beyond weight loss.” This may be due to the effects of the drug on the heart and blood vessels, inflammation, insulin resistance and other factors, they said. While people receiving semaglutide lost weight, as was expected, the weight reduction was 40% lower than what was seen by people with heart failure but not diabetes in an earlier trial. Choi said this lower weight loss in patients with diabetes is expected. Other glucose-lowering drugs that patients were taking — such as insulin or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — may “blunt” the weight loss effects of semaglutide, he told Healthline. Wright said the study “raises the important issue as to whether administration of a GLP-1 receptor agonist would have similar benefits in those individuals with heart failure but without obesity or diabetes.” This would need to be studied in future clinical trials.  The average age of participants in the study was 69 years and almost half were women. Almost two-thirds had a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher, with people having diabetes for 8 years on average. In addition to diuretics, most participants were receiving other standard treatments, including renin-angiotensin system blockers and beta-blockers. Some were also on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and SGLT2 inhibitors. Approximately 15% of people in each group discontinued the study treatment early. In addition, 80% of the people in the semaglutide group who finished the trial were still on the weekly maintenance dose. In the placebo group, 18 patients were hospitalized or had an urgent visit related to heart failure, compared to seven patients in the semaglutide group. Certain adverse events occurred less often in the semaglutide group, including hypoglycemia and diabetic retinopathy. These are both complications of type 2 diabetes. Overall, 10.6% of participants in the semaglutide group stopped treatment early due to an adverse event, while 8.2% in the placebo group did. This included gastrointestinal disorders, which are a known side effect of GLP-1s. The study has some limitations, including the small number of participants and that researchers only followed people for one year. More study will be needed to verify the findings. However, “[the study] findings strongly support that a GLP-1 receptor agonist, such as semaglutide, should now be considered an important ‘fifth pillar’ of pharmacologic treatment of patients with heart failure and obesity,” Wright told Healthline, “even for those already on conventional pharmacologic treatments.” Although Ni agrees that weight loss can improve functioning and quality of life in people with heart failure, he questions whether a drug like semaglutide should be recommended for all patients with this condition. “I’m constantly telling my patients that weight loss can help with heart failure symptoms, but it doesn’t have to be with a medication,” he told Healthline. “A lot of my focus is on healthy lifestyle — exercise, diet and natural weight loss — as a means to improve heart failure outcomes.” Choi emphasized that while the use of semaglutide is growing, the medication should be used only for approved indications, which currently includes weight loss, treatment of diabetes and reducing heart-related risks in certain people. “In addition, strict adherence to a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise and gradual dose titration [of semaglutide] is important to avoid negative side effects,” he said. Researchers recruited over 600 people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), obesity and type 2 diabetes. They randomly assigned people to receive weekly injections of semaglutide (Wegovy) or an inactive placebo. After one year, people who had received semaglutide had greater improvements in quality of life and physical functioning, in addition to reductions in key biomarkers related to heart function. People also experienced fewer exacerbations requiring a doctor’s visit or hospitalization. People with heart failure and type 2 diabetes lost less weight on semaglutide compared to those in an earlier trial without diabetes. This, say researchers, suggests that semaglutide offers heart-related benefits beyond those involving weight loss."," People with type 2 diabetes and a certain type of heart failure saw improvements in their symptoms after 1 year of semaglutide injections, a new study shows.

103,Diagnosed with Colon Cancer at 7 Months Pregnant: How This Mom Navigated Treatment,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/colon-cancer-pregnant-treatment,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/amanda-webb-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 9, 2024",Amanda Webb’s life took an unexpected turn when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer while she was 31 weeks pregnant. Here’s how she navigated…,"Colorectal cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50 years old and the second leading cause of cancer death in females under 50. Amanda Webb shares her journey of being diagnosed with early-onset stage 4 colon cancer while seven months pregnant with her first child. Screenings, such as colonoscopy, can help prevent and detect colon cancer. While six months pregnant, Amanda Webb felt healthy and strong as she carried on her usual routine of running and biking. But a few weeks later, her life took a turn she never expected. Because she was 36 years old, she was considered an advanced age for pregnancy, which meant her doctors recommended genetic screening of the baby. The results initially suggested Trisomy 13, a rare chromosome abnormality in the baby. “Babies don’t typically live longer than a week with that and have severe medical issues, so for about a week, we grappled with the potential that we might have to terminate a wanted pregnancy,” Webb told Healthline. However, a follow-up test of her amniotic fluid showed that the baby was healthy. Her doctors informed her that sometimes cancer cells in a woman can cause false positives in a genetic screening test. Because a few years earlier Webb was diagnosed with stage IA malignant melanoma after having a mole removed, her doctors ordered further testing. She went to a melanoma clinic for a more in-depth mole check, but nothing concerning showed up. For extra precaution, the clinic ordered an MRI, which detected tumors on Webb’s liver. “Initially, they thought they were benign and possibly grew during pregnancy, but then things started to get really expedited,” Webb said. She was referred to a high risk obstetrician who admitted her to the hospital for a few days, so she could quickly undergo a CT scan, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and biopsy. On May 20, 2021, at 31 weeks pregnant, just shy of her 37th birthday, Webb was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. While a previous history of several cancers is associated with colon cancer, malignant melanoma is not a common one, said Carla Justiniano, MD, a colorectal surgeon at the University of Cincinnati Cancer Center and assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. “Being pregnant is really what found the cancer,” Webb said. Because Webb was far enough into her pregnancy, her doctors assured her that she could undergo the same treatment plan that she would if she weren’t pregnant. “I didn’t have to do what some pregnant women with cancer have to do in making a decision of starting treatment while pregnant, or finishing out the pregnancy first, or not finishing the pregnancy,” said Webb. Unlike women who are not pregnant, she received her first three chemotherapy treatments while staying in the hospital under the care of antepartum staff who monitored the baby. “Then I had my C-section to deliver Levi at about 37 weeks,” she said. Three weeks after her son was born, Webb had five more rounds of chemotherapy and then surgery, which removed the entire right lobe of her liver and 20% of her colon. She then underwent five more rounds of chemotherapy. “I feel really lucky and am absolutely amazed at what [my doctors] were able to accomplish in a matter of seven months,” said Webb. “I was undergoing treatment for months before I knew that a lot of people with stage 4 diagnosis aren’t treated to be cured when it comes to colorectal cancer; a lot of them are on chemo for life.” After finishing treatment while being a new mom, Webb said the adjustment to her new reality was more than she expected. “I thought after finishing treatment it would kind of be a flip of the switch, and things would go back to the way they were, and that was a joke on me,” she said. “After finishing treatment and being so used to being in fight mode, you’re released back into civilian life, but cancer is all the sudden a huge part of who you are. It was difficult to navigate that and unpack the trauma.” She found comfort on social media by following different nonprofits affiliated with colorectal cancer. Stories from others going through cancer, as well as survivors, brought her hope. “I wasn’t ready to be transparent on social media about what I was going through…but it was such a huge motivator for me to see these people who had gone through the good, bad, and the ugly,” said Webb. When the organization Fight Colorectal Cancer (Fight CRC) hosted a local northern California hike, she went. “I just felt like those are my people. Worst club; best members,” she said. In 2023, she went with Fight CRC to Washington DC, to participate in the Call-on Congress, which pushes policymakers to make changes regarding colorectal cancer. After she returned, she became a 2023–2024 ambassador for the organization. Since then, she went back to DC, led an annual colorectal cancer awareness run with her local run club, and shared her story to spread awareness. “For me, talking about it helps,” Webb said. “I’m not one to be front and center…but if getting on the stage makes people aware that this can happen to young people and pregnant women that consider themselves healthy, then I’ll do it.” With the American Cancer Society (ACS) reporting
that colorectal cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50 years old and the second leading cause of cancer death in women under 50, Webb takes to heart spreading awareness about early detection and benefits of early colonoscopies. “The issue with the early onset group is it’s tough for us to get the access to the screenings when we have symptoms,” she said. “People are getting diagnosed with IBS, and for some reason, a lot of people are being gaslighted by primary care providers instead of sent for a colonoscopy because everyone thinks it’s still in that older age group, and then we’re diagnosed at later stages.” In the years leading up to her diagnosis, she experienced minor symptoms, such as frequent bowel movements and not feeling like she fully emptied her bowel. She chalked these up to being a runner and having a high metabolism. When she brought the symptoms up to her primary care doctor, they suggested she cut out dairy. “You have to be your own advocate. You know yourself better than anyone else. Don’t take ‘no’ for an answer if you think you should have that colonoscopy,” she said. “It’s the poop cancer that people don’t want to talk about, but we shouldn’t have to have digestive issues, something can be done about it.” Colonoscopy still remains the standard of care and can be lifesaving, said Cathy Eng,MD, director of Fight CRC and director of the Young Adults Cancers Program at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center. “[Remember] 45 is the new screening age,” she told Healthline. “If you have a first-degree relative, please start screening 10 years earlier than your relative’s diagnosis. Also important for others to learn about their family history.” However, she added that while many people think colorectal cancer is hereditary, the majority of cases are sporadic. “[This] is likely explained by a birth cohort effect where only persons born after the 1950s experienced the increasing rates of colorectal cancer, meaning these people have had different exposures to foods and environmental factors that impact the microbiome and inflammation in their colon, which are thereby thought to drive carcinogenesis,” Justiniano told Healthline. Because early-stage colon cancer often doesn’t show any symptoms, she stressed the importance of screening. “Patients with a diagnosis, especially when caught at screening, are often in disbelief because they feel fine, but in fact, many colon cancer patients are caught early and have zero symptoms, which highlights the importance of a screening colonoscopy,” she said. When caught early, colon cancer is often curable. “There are many cancers that we cannot screen for, but colorectal cancer is not one of those, and thus we should be appreciative of that and take advantage of it,” said Justiniano. “If patients got their colonoscopies as per guidelines, the incidence of advanced or late-stage colorectal cancer among patients older than 45 should be much lower than it is now, and therefore survival would be much better.” Fight CRC offers a free, medically-reviewed colorectal cancer screening quiz, which can help assess your risk. It also provides guidance on how to discuss screening options with your doctor."," “Babies don’t typically live longer than a week with that and have severe medical issues, so for about a week, we grappled with the potential that we might have to terminate a wanted pregnancy,” Webb told Healthline. “Being pregnant is really what found the cancer,” Webb said. “I didn’t have to do what some pregnant women with cancer have to do in making a decision of starting treatment while pregnant, or finishing out the pregnancy first, or not finishing the pregnancy,” said Webb."

A new study
suggests that replacing sugar with sweeteners does not cause an increase in appetite – contrary to previous studies of lower quality. The researchers studied 53 healthy adults as the latest study to be published by the SWEET consortium of 29 European research, consumer, and industry partners. The study was recently published in eBioMedcine
. The SWEET consortium is dedicated to researching and evaluating the long-term advantages and drawbacks associated with transitioning to sweeteners and sweetness enhancers within the realms of public health and safety, obesity, and sustainability. The researchers looked at how people’s appetites changed after eating foods with sugar versus non-sugar sweeteners. This study included 53 healthy adults with a body mass index (BMI) 25–35. A person with a BMI over 25 is considered as having overweight, if it is over 30 they are considered as having obesity. Participants were ages 18-60 and were randomly assigned to eat one of three types of cookies (called biscuits in the study). One group consumed a portion of cookies containing sucrose (sugar), while the other two groups consumed cookies with sweeteners (stevia or neotame) every day for two weeks. This was followed by a two-week washout period where participants returned to their regular diets. Stevia is a naturally occurring sugar substitute made from a stevia plant. Neotame is an artificial sweetener sold under the brand name Newtame that is 13,000 times sweeter than table sugar. Afterward, the individuals in the study were assigned to another group of cookies, and the cycle repeated for a total of three rounds. This ensured that each participant tried all three types of cookies but in a different order. Researchers found no difference in appetite levels between those who consumed sucrose and those who consumed the other sweeteners. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between satiety-related hormones like ghrelin, GLP-1, or pancreatic polypeptide (PP). These were measured immediately after eating and at various intervals thereafter, on day 1 and day 14 of each cookie consumption period.  Researchers also observed the impact that sugar vs. sweeteners had on blood sugar and insulin levels after eating. Overall, participants who consumed sweeteners had a lower insulin response than those who consumed sugar. However, the blood sugar results differed based on type of sweetener. While both stevia and neotame showed reduced blood sugar response compared to sugar, only stevia showed a significant difference. This is the first of its kind study to investigate the impact of consuming food containing either sugar or two types of food sweeteners. Prior research has predominantly focused
on beverages
. But these types of studies are limited since unlike beverages eating solid food will have different impacts on digestion, satiety and post-meal responses. This study was a highly-controlled, gold-standard design that was conducted over a minimum 70-day study period. Very few studies in the past have examined the effects of repeated daily consumption of sweeteners as part of a regular diet. Finally, this study included volunteers with a BMI of 25–35 and participants of both sexes. However, the study is relatively small with only 53 individuals studied, so more research will be needed to verify these findings. It depends on how “healthy” is defined. In terms of blood sugar and insulin response, there is strong evidence to suggest that choosing non-sugar sweeteners has a favorable effect. This is found in both food and beverages. A 2023 review and meta-analysis
of earlier studies found that non-nutritive sweeteners with single or blends had no immediate metabolic and endocrine effects, similar to water. “Reducing sugar consumption has become a key public health target in the fight to reduce the rising burden of obesity-related metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes,” the study authors stated. High blood sugar and insulin responses play a role in developing metabolic disease, though risk assessment is not a “one-size-fits-all” approach. Regardless, this is a valuable finding to improve the health status of individuals. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a new guideline
that recommends against the use of non-sugar sweeteners (NSS), also known as non-nutritive sweeteners, to control body weight or reduce the risk of noncommunicable diseases. Julie Stefanski MEd, RDN, LDN, FAND, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics
told Healthline that every person is different and that even the same food product or sugar substitute may have varied impacts on different people. “The use of a nonnutritive sweetener is only a very small piece of an overall dietary pattern and physical activity routine. Each person choosing to use a food product that contains a nonnutritive sweetener versus traditional sources of sugar needs to assess whether it meets their health goals, whether weight-focused or aiming for better blood glucose control,” Stefanski said. Researchers randomly assigned participants to eat cookies with sucrose or one of two types of sweeteners every day for two weeks. The results showed that there was no difference in appetite after sugar or sweetener consumption. However, blood sugar and insulin responses were lower after eating sweeteners. This suggests that consuming foods with sweeteners instead of sugar may be a tool to help with lowering blood sugar and insulin levels. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and the impact on long-term health."," A recent study indicates that replacing sugar with sweeteners like stevia does not increase appetite levels They also found these non-sugar sweeteners may reduce blood sugar and insulin response after eating Previous concerns about sweeteners increasing appetite were not based on robust evidence.

this month, examined the food-liking patterns and dietary preferences of more than 180,000 adults in the United Kingdom and broke those patterns into four categories: More than half of the people surveyed fell into the “balanced” category, and their reported mental health outcomes and cognitive function were better than any of the other three. Those who followed the high-protein/low-fiber diet had lower gray matter volumes in a part of the brain called the postcentral gyrus, which coordinates how our body moves through the environment, than those who followed a balanced diet. Additionally, the people who were vegetarian had higher gray matter volumes in part of the brain called the thalamus and precuneus. Notably, the study found an increased risk of mental health issues in those who consumed more vegetables and fruits, a finding the authors explained could be due to the design of their study and requires further study.  Highly processed foods have been found to contribute to a wide variety of health issues, including: Diets like the Mediterranean diet, which has an emphasis on fish and vegetables, have shown promising effects on physical health. But diets that aid in reducing inflammation can also have a significant impact on brain health and mental health, according to Molly Rapozo, RDN, Registered Dietician Nutritionist & Senior Nutrition and Health Educator at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA, who was not involved in the study. “Diets characterized by high intakes of antioxidant rich vegetables and fruit, limited meat consumption, and use of anti-inflammatory olive oil as a primary fat source are associated with decreased dementia risk. For instance, adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, which is high in plant-based foods and low in high-saturated fat foods, has been linked to improved cognitive function and larger brain volumes in specific regions,” Rapozo told Healthline. Rapozo also said that diets high in saturated fats, sugars, and refined carbohydrates have been associated with decreased cognitive function and brain volume. “The impact of diet on the gut microbiome also plays a significant role in brain health, with evidence suggesting that a healthy gut, promoted by diets rich in dietary fiber, may preserve the gut-brain axis and potentially improve cognition,” Rapozo said. By creating balance in eating habits, the study suggests, people can lay a foundation for better mental health and cognition. Lifestyle choices are also a significant factor, Rapozo said, citing quality sleep, regular exercise, and good stress-management techniques as essential to supplement a balanced diet. Rapozo said the study was “exciting” in part because it was such a large study with over 181,000 participants and had a significant amount of data involved. “It was also found that high protein, low fiber diets with an emphasis on snack foods were associated with lower well-being scores, higher levels of inflammatory markers, and an increased stroke risk. These findings appear to agree with what we already know about diet and brain health,” Rapozo said. “We can modify our diets to improve brain health by Including vegetables, fruit, starches such as whole grains, legumes, and potatoes; as well as lean protein, fatty fish, and plant fats such as nuts, seeds, avocado, olives, and olive oil. Eat less highly processed snack foods, fatty meats including bacon and sausage, sugar, and other refined carbohydrates.” Diets like paleo, keto, and Whole 30 all focus on less of a particular nutrient, like carbohydrates, but are not intended to be followed for long periods of time, Melanie Murphy Richter, a registered dietitian nutritionist and the director of communications for the nutrition company Prolon, who was not involved in the study, told Healthline. “A strict keto diet with little to no carbohydrates can add significant stress and inflammation to the body and cause a variety of nutritional deficiencies and potential poor health outcomes. The Whole 30 diet is actually phase one of a larger food auditioning plan for people to learn their food intolerances. Many people start and stop at Whole 30, and never go on to the actual food auditioning that it was designed to prep your body for,” Richter said. “Most people struggle to understand what ‘balanced’ means and so they aren’t aware of how to get all the nutrients they need within the parameters of these diets. But it’s possible! For vegans, prioritizing plant-based proteins like legumes, lentils, tofu, beans, nuts, seeds, and peas will help ensure they meet the proper protein criteria without animal meats or dairy. It’s also important not to use veganism as an excuse to eat loads of vegan processed foods, as many people do.” Rapozo echoed a similar path for her clients, saying that specific diets of restriction are targeting specific goals, but that people should look at longer-term ideals for how they eat. “Special diets are implemented to gain desired results such as weight loss, avoidance of food allergens, personal values, etc. When working with clients my goal is to help people make their meal plans as brain healthy as possible,” Rapozo said. “For instance, keto can emphasize plant fats, lean protein, and fatty fish instead of high saturated fat sources. Vegan diets can be more balanced with plant proteins from legumes, soy, nuts, and seeds. Once client goals are met, I encourage the inclusion of a greater variety of foods.” A new study of more than 180,000 people in the UK suggests that a balanced diet, which does not restrict specific foods, is associated with better mental health and cognitive function. By focusing less on a diet of restrictions, experts say, a better overall cognitive outcome can be made possible. But lifestyle choices, like sleep quality, exercise, and stress management, are also important factors to mental health and cognition."," Starch-free or reduced starch Vegetarian High protein and low fiber Balanced Cardiovascular disease-related death Anxiety and common mental health conditions Type 2 diabetes Obesity Sleep disorders Depression The old adage about following a balanced diet is mostly known for its positive physical benefits, but a new study suggests that such eating habits have significant effects on mental health and cognition.

Lauren Boebert Treated for Blood Clot, Diagnosed with May-Thurner Syndrome",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/lauren-boebert-may-thurner-syndrome,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Lauren-Boebert-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 5, 2024",Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has been diagnosed with May-Thurner Syndrome following her hospitalization for a blood clot. Here's what to know about…,"Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has been diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome, a vascular abnormality in the pelvis. The discovery was made following her hospitalization for a blood clot. Boebert has undergone surgery for the clot and is making a full recovery Leg pain Leg swelling Skin discoloration Leg ulcers Enlarged veins Severe foot and ankle pain Affected skin that feels warmer than the surrounding area Leg cramps Skin discoloration, turning pale, reddish, or bluish United States Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has been diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome, an uncommon vascular condition, after having a blood clot removed from her leg. In May-Thurner syndrome
, arteries in the pelvis become compressed, leading to blood flow problems and, potentially, blood clots in the left leg. Boebert’s surgery was a success, and she is making a full recovery. However, her ordeal has brought attention to a condition that may, in fact, be more widespread than previously believed. According to a statement from Boebert’s campaign on April 3, the 37-year-old Congresswoman from Colorado was admitted to the UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies for “severe swelling in her upper left leg.” Doctors identified an acute blood clot using a CT scan and subsequently diagnosed Boebert with May-Thurner syndrome. The following day she underwent surgery to remove the clot and insert a stent. Although it’s unclear what the exact cause of the clot was, Boebert’s team cited “dehydration, travel, and extended periods of sitting” as potential factors. “After taking time to rest as recommended by doctors, she is expected to make a full recovery with no significant concerns for her long-term health and no hindrance to her ability to perform her duties as a Congresswoman,” the statement said. Lawrence “Rusty” Hofmann, MD, a Professor and Chief of Interventional Radiology at Stanford Medicine who has spent 20 years studying May-Thurner syndrome, told Healthline that what Boebert experienced is “pretty typical.” “She presented with an acute deep venous thrombosis, and that is a blood clot that can occur in any of your deep veins in your arms, legs, or pelvis, and cause swelling and pain. That by itself is very rarely severely dangerous, but the real worry is that these clots can break off, go to your lung,” he said. May-Thurner syndrome is a condition in which the right common iliac artery (the primary blood vessel carrying blood to the right leg) compresses the left iliac vein (the primary blood vessel carrying blood from the left leg to the heart), which can result in blood flow problems and blood clots. It was first described in 1957 by its namesake, Dr. May and Dr. Thurner. “It’s a normal variant in which they noticed that the artery that goes to the right leg compresses the vein to the left leg,” said Hofmann, “They defined it as when the vein is compressed by fifty percent.” Hofmann calls it a “normal variant” because it is believed to be present in individuals without symptoms, who may go their whole lives without it becoming a serious health issue. “If you have May-Thurner syndrome and no symptoms, you do not need any medicine or any procedures. It is just how you were ‘put together at the factory,’” he said. Estimates vary on how common May-Thurner syndrome is, however, because it is often only diagnosed in association with deep vein thrombosis, as in the case of Boebert. Some estimates indicate that one in five people
experience iliac vein compression but don’t have a formal diagnosis of May-Thurner syndrome. Other research
puts the number between 14 and 32% of the general population. While some may never have symptoms of May-Thurner syndrome, it can manifest through various symptoms, including: Of greater concern is the potential for deep-vein thrombosis, which is when a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins of the leg. Research indicates that May-Thurner syndrome may be responsible for between 2 and 5% of all deep vein thrombosis. Symptoms of deep-vein thrombosis include: Deep-vein thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism, a serious and potentially fatal condition in which the blood clot that has formed in the leg travels to the lungs. “If you get a big blood clot, like the type that would kill you, you are going to know. It’s going to be, ‘Oh, my leg is almost twice the size of my other leg, and it hurts like crazy, and I need to go to the emergency room,’” said Hofmann. May-Thurner syndrome may require no treatment at all unless it leads to deep vein thrombosis. Doctors typically use imaging tools such as CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds to check for blood clots and compression. If a patient is determined to have May-Thurner syndrome or an acute blood clot, they will determine a course of action. Treatment may require hospitalization and surgery. “The blood clot, if you don’t fix this properly, you’re at an increased risk for blood clots for life. What we do to treat this is we go in, and we use either drugs or a device to suck the blood clot out and clean up the vein,” said Hofmann. To lower future risk of blood clots, blood-thinning medications are commonly prescribed. In some cases, a doctor may elect for a surgical procedure such as removal of the iliac artery or bypass surgery
. More commonly, to prevent future blood flow problems, doctors may insert a stent into the affected vein or artery. “[A stent] is basically curative. I have patients that are twenty or twenty-five years out and have never had another blood clot. They are not on blood thinners, and they’re doing great,” said Hofmann. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has been diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome, an uncommon vascular abnormality. May-Thurner syndrome affects blood flow in the legs and can lead to more serious health problems, such as deep vein thrombosis. Boebert received surgery to remove the blood clot and insert a stent. She is making a full recovery."," Boebert has undergone surgery for the clot and is making a full recovery Leg pain Leg swelling Skin discoloration Leg ulcers Enlarged veins Severe foot and ankle pain Affected skin that feels warmer than the surrounding area Leg cramps Skin discoloration, turning pale, reddish, or bluish United States Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has been diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome, an uncommon vascular condition, after having a blood clot removed from her leg.

This is the second person to test positive for H5N1 bird flu in the United States, and the first case linked to exposure to cattle. The risk to the general public remains low, because there is no sign of person-to-person transmission of the virus. eye redness flu-like upper respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose pneumonia fever muscle or body aches headaches fatigue difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Avoid direct contact with wild birds, or with wild or domestic birds that appear sick or have died. Avoid unprotected exposure to infected live or dead animals, including cattle, domestic pets, and other mammals. To move or discard a dead bird or other animal, don’t touch it with your bare hands. Use gloves or a plastic bag to place the body inside a garbage bag. Wash your hands with soap and water after exposure to wild birds or other animals, as well as domesticated farm animals. A person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu after close contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected, health officials said Apr. 1. The person’s only symptom is eye inflammation, and they are being treated with the antiviral drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir), Texas health officials said. The risk to the public “remains low,” they added. This is the second person in the United States to test positive for H5N1 bird flu, and the first case linked to exposure to cattle, federal health officials said. A previous human case
of bird flu occurred in Colorado in 2022, in a person who had contact with infected poultry. There is no evidence of person-to-person spread of the virus, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told AP News. Genetic tests
carried out by the CDC on samples from the patient in Texas and infected cattle show that the virus lacks changes that would make it better able to infect mammals. There is also no sign that the virus has developed resistance to antiviral treatments, the CDC said. The tests also suggest that the infection in the patient involves the eyes, but perhaps not the upper respiratory tract. In late March, dairy cows in Kansas and Texas tested positive for bird flu. Since then, the outbreak has spread to additional herds in New Mexico and Ohio. Federal agriculture officials emphasized that the food supply remains safe. Milk from sick cows is diverted or destroyed, and pasteurization kills any viruses or bacteria in milk. Bird flu is a disease caused by an influenza virus that mainly infects birds. These types of viruses, known as avian influenza A viruses
, spread naturally among wild aquatic birds such as ducks and geese. From there, they can pass to chickens and other domesticated poultry. There are two groups of these viruses: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The second group causes severe disease and high death rates in infected birds. This group includes the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus — aka H5N1 bird flu — detected in cattle and the patient in Texas. Certain bird flu viruses can spread to and infect mammals
, including seals, bears, foxes, skunks, domestic cats and dogs, and humans
. “People who are at risk are those who have direct and prolonged exposure with infected, ill or dead animals, or areas contaminated by infected birds or animals,” said Dean Blumberg, MD, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children’s Hospital. It is rare for bird flu viruses to spread from an infected person to another person, but it has happened. In these cases
, the virus has spread to only a few people, and often within a person’s household, where there is prolonged, close contact. “Human-to-human transmission is extraordinarily rare,” Blumberg told Healthline, “and in fact there is no risk of sustained human-to-human transmission, so this [virus] poses no threat to the general public.” The federal government maintains a stockpile
of vaccines, including ones that target H5N1 and H7N9 bird flu viruses. These could be mobilized if there are signs of human-to-human spread of the virus. However, Blumberg said the chance of that happening right now is low. “It would be concerning if avian influenza evolved to be more easily transmitted among people, since [we have] little to no immunity to this virus,” he said. “However this has not happened since bird flu was first described almost 150 years ago.” Symptoms
of bird flu in people range from mild to severe, and may include: As of December 2023, 902 people
have been infected with avian influenza H5N1 virus worldwide in 23 countries, reports the CDC. More than 50% of people died as a result of their infection. However, the severity of the cases varied depending upon the genetic characteristics of the virus involved, ranging from causing no symptoms to leading to severe illness and death. With only one human case in the recent outbreak associated with dairy cattle, it is too soon to know if all cases will be mild like the first one. Health officials are closely watching the situation. To protect yourself and your pets from bird flu, the CDC recommends
: If you find a dead bird, check with your state health department, state veterinary diagnostic laboratory, or state wildlife agency to find out how to report it. In addition, “for those who work in the [animal] industry and do have contact with potentially infectious animals and environments, full personal protective equipment) should be used including goggles, N95 or equivalent, gown, gloves, hair and boot covers,” said Blumberg. The CDC also recommends that you get a seasonal flu vaccine. This won’t protect you from bird flu, but will reduce your risk of getting seasonal flu and bird flu at the same time. Health officials reported that a person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu after close contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus. The person’s only symptom is eye inflammation. Tests by the CDC suggest that the infection in the patient may only involve the eyes, not the upper respiratory tract.

108,Why Diet and Fitness Influencers Are Telling People to Eat Sticks of Butter,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-diet-and-fitness-influencers-are-telling-people-to-eat-sticks-of-butter,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/butter-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 5, 2024",Diet and fitness influencers are encouraging people to eat sticks of butter as part of low carb eating plans like the carnivore diet. Here’s how that…,"People on social media are snacking on butter as part of the carnivore diet. Proponents claim it aids weight loss by contributing to feelings of fullness and has other wellbeing benefits like improved mood and energy. However, dietitians don’t recommend it and warn that snacking on butter can contribute to heart problems, nutrient deficiencies, and gut issues. Healthier snack options include nuts, seeds, fruit, and vegetables. Social media is often where weird and potentially dangerous health advice gains traction. The latest in a long line of questionable – and often harmful – nutrition trends is snacking on sticks of butter. Snacking on sticks of butter has become a popular practice among some TikTok creators following the carnivore diet. The carnivore diet involves eating only animal-based products – like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy – excluding plant-based foods, with some people claiming it can aid with weight loss. The aim is to consume zero carbs. In one video on the social media platform, TikTok creator @steakandbuttergirl is seen biting into a stick of butter while sharing that she eats butter every day for “happy hormones, great skin, energy and mood.” Many users on the app also snack on sticks of butter as a weight loss tactic, with some using butter as a meal replacement. However, butter is an unconventional weight-loss food, and overconsumption of it is associated with a number of poor health outcomes. Here two dietitians explain why snacking on butter is not a healthy choice. Paediatric dietitian Emma Shafqat says this trend is concerning because butter is very high in saturated fat and calories, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems. “While fat is an essential part of our diet, it’s all about moderation,” she points out. “It’s important that our meals are balanced, and we consume food in the five main food groups to ensure that we get all the essential nutrients that our body needs to stay healthy.” Shafqat says that the high saturated fat content found in butter may increase your LDL cholesterol and, therefore, your risk of heart disease. What’s more, she says many people are already over-consuming saturated fat, and snacking on butter won’t help matters. “Men should not eat more than 30g of saturated fat a day, and women should not eat more than 20g,” she points out. A 2014 study
found that higher saturated fat intake was associated with higher obesity and body mass index (BMI) scores. Registered dietitian nutritionist Claire Rifkin says that fat is the most calorie-dense nutrient. It’s also true that fats are essential for satiety, helping to quell hunger. “This likely leads some to believe that consuming sticks of butter can efficiently meet a significant portion of their caloric needs while also maintaining feelings of fullness,” she explains. “However, the reality is that simply consuming a stick of saturated fat, which lacks fiber-rich carbohydrates and protein, is unlikely to provide lasting satiety.” Low fiber isn’t only a problem because you’ll likely be left feeling hungry. “Without enough fiber in your diet, you might experience constipation,” Shafqat points out. “Low-fiber diets are also linked
to increased prevalence of gut diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, type 1 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome.” Rifkin shares similar concerns. “The absence of dietary fiber can negatively impact gut microbiota and digestion, leading to constipation and, in more severe cases, colon cancer, which is on the rise in young people.” When you routinely reach for a stick of butter over healthier snack options, like a piece of fruit or some vegetables, for example, you also increase your risk of nutrient deficiencies. “A diet consisting of just animal foods may be low in vitamins that are often obtained from plant foods,” Shafqat examples. She points to a 2018 study
that showed a high-animal protein and a low carbohydrate diet was low in B₁, D, E, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, nutrients that contribute to your overall health. One vitamin of particular concern, according to Shafqat, is vitamin C. “Meats are not a good source of vitamin C, and if you aren’t consuming enough of it, it can result in scurvy.” The carnivore diet isn’t considered a healthy eating style, and there is no evidence to support claims that it can eliminate certain health issues. What’s more, eliminating plant-based food sources could make it difficult for you to consume adequate amounts of nutrients that are important for health. However, if you’re someone who likes to eat a predominately animal-based diet, how can you do so in a healthier way? Shafqat says it’s essential that anyone following this diet add micronutrient-rich foods or supplements to reduce the risk of deficiency in this diet. That will mean taking a less rigid approach to the carnivore diet, but it could be better for your health in the long term. It’s a good idea to swap out that stick of butter for a nutrient-rich snack, like carrot sticks, crunchy bell peppers, or even an orange, to up your intake of vitamin C. You shouldn’t ever use butter as a meal replacement. Instead, Shafqat recommends healthier swaps like oily fish and eggs. “Eggs provide choline, folate, vitamin D, iodine, B vitamins, and high quality protein, while oily fish is a healthy source of omega-3,” she explains. Meanwhile, Rifkin says you should consider snacking on nuts and seeds instead. “A handful of mixed nuts and seeds, such as almonds, cashews, and pumpkin seeds, offers a convenient, portable snack option that’s rich in beneficial fats,” she notes. “Unlike the saturated fats found in butter, the fats in nuts and seeds are the healthy type of fat that actually supports heart health.” Butter isn’t a healthy snack option, and consuming it regularly as part of the carnivore diet can increase your risk of heart disease, nutrient deficiencies, and other health problems. If you must consume a predominately animal-based diet, it’s better to take a more flexible approach, swapping sticks of butter for healthier snacks like nuts, fruit, and vegetables."," However, dietitians don’t recommend it and warn that snacking on butter can contribute to heart problems, nutrient deficiencies, and gut issues.

109,Gut Bacteria Linked to Higher Obesity Risk is Different for Men and Women,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/gut-bacteria-linked-to-higher-obesity-risk-is-different-for-men-and-women,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/couple-biking-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 5, 2024","New research indicates that certain strains of bacteria are associated with obesity, while others may be protective against it. Additionally, it…","Researchers have discovered specific gut bacteria associated with obesity, while some appear to be protective against it. The specific types of bacteria associated with obesity differed between men and women. A clear causal link between gut bacteria and obesity has not yet been clearly established in humans, but experts say that encouraging a healthy gut is still a good idea. In a new study, researchers have discovered that not only can bacteria in the gut be associated with obesity, but that different bacteria affect men and women differently. Prior research
has established a connection between the gut microbiome — the community of microorganisms, bacteria, and viruses that reside in the gastrointestinal tract — and obesity. Some strains of bacteria and the like appear to promote obesity, while others may be protective against it. In a forthcoming study that will be presented at this year’s 2024 European Congress on Obesity, researchers have made additional discoveries about this complex process. Using metabolomic and metagenomic data from the Spanish population, researchers identified specific bacteria for men and women that appear to either promote or protect against obesity. “Having a study that can assess different microbiome components and seeing differences between those who may have higher risk for obesity or with a higher index of obesity versus those with a lower index is impressive,” Nakul Bhardwaj, DO, MPH, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, told Healthline. He wasn’t affiliated with the research. On the other hand, Karen D. Corbin, PhD, RD, a Spokesperson for The Obesity Society and Associate Investigator at the AdventHealth Translational Research Institute, was more measured in her response to the research, telling Healthline, “It adds some knowledge to the field about a possible connection between the gut microbes and obesity…What we need more of is data that shows whether the microbes actually cause obesity or if they are a reflection of your weight status and whatever’s going on metabolically in your body. That was not addressed in this paper.” Corbin was not involved in the research. Both Bhardwaj and Corbin stressed that the study only shows association, not causation. For their study, Spanish researchers recruited 361 adults with an average age of 44 years old. More than two-thirds (251) were women. Participants were separated into two classes based on a measurement called the “obesity index”: low level of obesity or high level of obesity. While many studies on obesity rely on body mass index or BMI alone, the investigators took a multifaceted approach with their obesity index. The obesity index is not a standardized gauge for obesity but one that includes three variables: BMI, fat mass percentage, and waist circumference. Corbin told Healthline that she appreciated the novelty of the index, but was unfamiliar with it as a tool: “I like the fact that they were trying to include something beyond BMI. My question would be: Have they validated this particular index compared to something like the traditional BMI alone?” she said. After classifying participants using the obesity index, researchers analyzed two types of data. They looked at metagenomic data, which is genetic material from a collection of microorganisms in a sample — in this case, stool samples. In addition, they looked at metabolomic data to analyze small molecules known as metabolites produced during cellular metabolism. These two types of data, when analyzed in concert, can give a very precise picture of gut health and metabolism. Using all of this data, researchers profiled some of the specific strains of bacteria found in the guts of the participants. The researchers then looked at the microbiome for people classified as “high” on the obesity index compared to those classified as “low” on the index. They found certain bacteria were linked with obesity risk, but that it was different for men versus women. In the study, the gut microbiome of both men and women who ranked high on the obesity index is characterized by a lack of a potentially protective bacteria known as Christensenella minuta
. Interestingly, women and men who were obese had distinct gut microbiota profiles from one another. In men, two other forms of bacteria associated with obesity were prolific: Parabacteroides helcogenes and Campylobacter canadensis. “Different microbes can be protective or they can increase risk for obesity. The way that they do that is by stimulating different aspects of our metabolic response and of our immune response…There are microbes such as E. coli that have been shown to increase risk of obesity because they’re known to be pro-inflammatory,” Mariana X. Byndloss, DVM, PhD, the Co-director of the Vanderbilt Microbiome Innovation Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told Healthline. She wasn’t affiliated with the research. In the study the bacterium species Prevotella micans, Prevotella brevis, and Prevotella sacharolitica were associated with obesity in women but not in men. “What I found most exciting was that they attempted to look at differences by sex, which I think it’s important to consider sex, ethnicity and race in what we’re seeing,” said Corbin, but also noted that prior studies have also investigated this. Research on the gut microbiome and metabolic diseases like obesity has not yet yielded a clear treatment, but there are definite ways to improve your overall gut health. The microorganisms that make up the ecosystem of the gut need food, just like you, so what you put in your body affects their health as well. “The thing people can do today is eat diets that feed your microbes by increasing dietary fiber, such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. And also foods that have not just fiber, but resistant starch,” said Corbin. Resistant starches are, as their name suggests, harder for the body to digest and are passed through the stomach and small intestine down to the colon where they feed beneficial gut bacteria. “Every time you look at your plate of food, ask yourself, have I fed my microbiome today? And if you haven’t, make a switch or make an addition to make sure there’s something in there that will literally directly feed the gut microbes,” said Corbin. There’s no quick fix, like a probiotic, either. “I’ll often have patients coming in who want a quick fix: a medication or a probiotic that will increase their ability to lose weight and treat obesity. The reality is we’re not at that stage yet. We haven’t had enough randomized control trials that really tell us that prescribing a particular probiotic or regimen to increase particular bacterial strains in the microbiota will lead to benefits,” said Bhardwaj. New research indicates that certain strains of bacteria are associated with obesity, while others may be protective against it. Furthermore, it appears that the types of bacteria linked with obesity are different in men and women. A clear causal link hasn’t yet been proven between these bacteria and developing obesity in humans, but research continues to show associations between gut health and metabolic disease."," Researchers have discovered specific gut bacteria associated with obesity, while some appear to be protective against it.

Using metabolomic and metagenomic data from the Spanish population, researchers identified specific bacteria for men and women that appear to either promote or protect against obesity."

Short bursts of physical activity increase production of…,"A new study finds that short bouts of exercise can help boost your immune system. This is linked to the production of “natural killer” cells which are a type of white blood cell. The study is small, and experts say more research is needed. New research has found that just 15 minutes of exercise can improve your immune function. The findings, which are being presented at the American Physiology Summit in Long Beach, CA this week, discovered that short bursts of physical activity increase the production of natural killer (NK) cells, which are a type of white blood cell that fight infected and cancerous cells in the body. The study has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. This isn’t the first study to link exercise to higher levels of NK cells in the bloodstream. Plus, the number of NK cells appears to increase mere minutes after engaging in physical activity. The researchers say the new findings add to the growing pile of evidence that targeting NK cells in the body
may provide better protection against infections and diseases. “These new results suggest shorter bouts of exercise are enough to activate the immune system and increase the body’s natural killer cells in blood circulation,” Michael Fredericson, MD, a professor of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at Stanford Medicine, told Healthline. Fredericson is not involved in the study. The small study involved 10 participants between the ages of 18 and 40. Each participant was instructed to ride a stationary bicycle for 30 minutes at moderate-level intensity. The researchers drew blood samples from the participants before they started cycling and again at the 15 and 30-minute mark. They found that levels of NK cells increased after 15 minutes of cycling, but did not continue to increase after 30 minutes of activity. According to the researchers, this suggests that exercising for around 15 minutes substantially boosts NK cells, which may provide meaningful protection against diseases. Unlike other aspects of the immune system, NK cells do not require previous exposure to a pathogen to identify and attack it. “Natural Killer cells are white blood cells that help destroy infected and diseased cells, such as cancer cells,” explains Fredericson. NK cells are constantly on the lookout for malignant cells and a lot of NK cells in the body may improve prognosis in various types of cancer. For example, one report found that the number of NK cells in the body was positively associated with survival in people with colorectal cancer. According to Tracy Zaslow, MD, a board-certified pediatrician and pediatric and adult primary care sports medicine specialist at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles, the body temperature rises during and right after exercise. Most bacteria and viruses thrive at a normal body temperature and the heat can make it harder for them to survive, similarly to what happens with a fever. Physical activity also reduces stress. “Lower levels of stress hormones may provide some protection against illnesses,” says Zaslow. This, in turn, can protect emotional well-being and decrease mental health issues like depression and anxiety. “Stress and depression can lead to chronic inflammation impacting the body’s ability to fight infections,” Zaslow said. Exercise improves sleep quality
and duration, and it’s been shown that a good night’s sleep is a crucial component
for optimal immune function, she added. Finally, exercise
can alleviate the harmful effects caused by free radicals and prevent oxidative stress — both of which contribute to chronic health conditions
. The takeaway, according to the researchers, is that even short bursts of moderate-intensity exercise may come with great health benefits. “Fifteen minutes of exercise is more doable for the general population and could motivate individuals to incorporate regular, brief exercise sessions into their daily routine, boosting their immune function,” says Fredericson. Breaking your workouts into shorter bouts may be just as effective as engaging in longer exercise sessions, Fredericson added. His advice: Any moderate-vigorous exercise will help boost your immune function and it’s important to find activities you enjoy and will be able to do regularly. Some options
include brisk walking at a pace of 2.5 miles per hour, dancing, water aerobics, tennis, biking, and gardening. Hiking, jogging, jumping rope, climbing stairs, and swimming are effective choices, too. The goal is to feel challenged, so you’re breathing harder than you typically do, but not completely exhausted. Keep in mind that there can be too much of a good thing, says Zaslow. Prolonged bouts of intense exercise can suppress the immune system, and it’s crucial to let your body rest between workouts. “The key is to create thoughtful exercise programs that enable regular physical activity while incorporating appropriate rest and recovery,” Zaslow said.

111,How to Protect Your Eyes During the Total Solar Eclipse,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/total-solar-eclipse-2024-eye-safety,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/female-solar-eclipse-732x549-thumbnail.jpg,"APRIL 4, 2024",Eclipse glasses with a special ISO filter should be worn when viewing the April 8 total solar eclipse to avoid eye damage.,"A total solar eclipse will travel across North America on April 8, 2024, with the path of totality visible in several major U.S. cities. When viewing a solar eclipse, eye safety should be a top priority to avoid permanent damage caused by solar retinopathy. Eclipse glasses should have a special ISO filter to prevent harmful ultraviolet and infrared light from penetrating the retina. It is unsafe to look directly at the sun without proper eye protection, even during eclipses. On Monday, April 8, the total solar eclipse of 2024 will sweep across a large swath of North America. During this astronomical event, the moon will pass between the sun and Earth, darkening the sky in significant portions of the United States from Texas to Maine. If the conditions are clear, viewers may also get a glimpse of Venus and Jupiter. More than half the U.S. population lives within 250 miles of the 115-mile wide path of totality, including major cities like Austin, Dallas, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo, Rochester, and Burlington, VT. The duration of totality will be up to 4 minutes and 27 seconds, nearly double that of The Great American Eclipse of August 21, 2017, which drew an estimated 20 million spectators. According to NASA, the next total solar eclipse visible in the U.S. won’t occur until August 23, 2044. When viewing solar eclipses, it’s important to wear specialized protective eyewear to prevent eye damage. Looking directly at the sun without eye protection could result in immediate and irreversible eye damage. Here’s what you need to know to protect your eyes during the total solar eclipse. Reminiscent of cardboard 3D viewing glasses, eclipse glasses are essential for protecting your eyes while viewing a solar eclipse. There are countless options of eclipse glasses available online and it may be difficult to determine which ones are safe and legitimate. When choosing protective eyewear, look for reputable sources that have been certified with the solar filter ISO 12312-2, which is the international standard for eclipse viewing glasses. If you plan to take pictures of the eclipse or view it through any type of lens, such as a telescope or binoculars, you should cover the lens with a special solar filter to avoid eye injury. You should never look directly at the sun without proper protective eyewear, even during solar eclipses. Sunglasses or homemade eclipse glasses do not provide sufficient protection. Although the moon obscures the sun’s brightness during an eclipse, it does not minimize the effects of the sun’s energy. Eclipse glasses that meet the ISO 12312-2 standard limit the ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths that reach the retina and filter most of the sun’s energy to prevent damage to the retina. Benjamin Bert, MD, board certified ophthalmologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, told Healthline the biggest danger of looking at the sun without proper protective eyewear is solar retinopathy, which essentially burns the retina. He said he’s seen a spike in patients with eye damage following prior solar eclipses. Bert compared solar retinopathy to using a magnifying glass to focus sunlight onto a sheet of paper until it catches fire. “You’re basically doing that to your eye,” he said. “And that burn is permanent. You can lose a spot in your vision if it gets burned like that. Once the damage is done, we currently don’t have any way to reverse it.” Your safest bet for eclipse viewing is to purchase a new pair of eclipse glasses with the certified ISO 12312-2 filter. If you’ve been hanging onto your old eclipse glasses from 2017’s Great American Solar Eclipse, you’ll want to ensure they’re in good condition before reusing them. Check for defects and damage and make sure there are no scratches, punctures, or tears in the filters. If the frames are bent or appear anything less than brand new, it’s time for a new pair. When the moon completely blocks the face of the sun during totality, what remains is the glowing halo of the sun’s corona, or atmosphere. Eclipse viewers should keep their glasses on during the partial phases of the eclipse, roughly 75 minutes before and after totality. You can determine when the partial phase will begin in your observing location with an eclipse calculator. According to NASA, it is safe to remove eclipse glasses during totality, but only if you are in the path of 100% totality. Astrophysicist Jamie Lombardi, PhD, professor of physics at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA, explained that during totality, eclipse viewers are shielded from the sun’s intense visible light, ultraviolet radiation, and infrared radiation. “Although the corona is still visible, it is much dimmer than the disk of the sun and is safe to view with the naked eye,” Lombardi told Healthline. Bryan Brewer, author of “ECLIPSE: Experience Awe in the Path of Totality,“ agreed it’s safe to remove your eclipse glasses during totality to view this celestial spectacle. “The eerie daytime darkness — punctuated by the magnificent view of the solar corona for just a few minutes — illustrates the awesome and relentless forces of the cosmos in a dramatic and accessible way,” Brewer told Healthline. Yehia Hashad, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Bausch + Lomb, explained that when the moon fully blocks the sun’s rays during totality, it’s OK to view the corona without protective eyewear, but you should remain vigilant. “If there is any portion of the sun visible, the rays can be very damaging,” Hashad told Healthline. “If you are at all uncertain if the sun is 100% covered, always revert to leaving your protective glasses on. The safest course of action is to wear your protective glasses throughout the event — you will still have quite a show,” Hashad noted. Bert echoed this sentiment, and advised against looking at the corona during totality altogether without protective eyewear. “Even if you’re in truly complete totality, the safest thing to do is just to leave them on. You can take them off, but don’t gaze at the sun,” Bert said. “If you’re planning on looking at the sun, wearing the glasses the whole time is certainly the safest option. That’s probably an extreme opinion, but when the risk is the potential for permanent retinal damage, you want to take every precaution that you can. It’s not worth the potential harm that can be done for the 5 minutes you would be able to see it,” Bert cautioned. You can safely view the effects of the eclipse indirectly without the need for protective eyewear. A box pinhole projector is a popular indirect eclipse viewing method. A pinhole projector allows you to safely observe the light generated by an eclipse through a small hole in an object onto a surface. This method results in shadows of tiny half-moons projected onto the ground or a wall. “That’s a much, much safer way to do it because you’re not gazing at the sun at all; you’re gazing at shadows,” Bert said. Solar retinopathy develops when the retina becomes damaged by exposure to solar radiation. The condition may cause permanent blind spots, distortion in your vision, or partial or full blindness, Hashad said. “Additional symptoms include blurred vision, increased light sensitivity, central blind spots in either or both eyes, distortions, and may change the way colors are viewed,” he added. According to Bert, there are telltale signs of eye damage from solar retinopathy caused by eclipse viewing. If you see little spots of flashing light, similar to the after-effects of a camera flash, you may have sustained eye damage. If the initial flashing lights resolve but the areas that were flashing remain dark, like spots in your vision, it could be a sign that permanent damage has occurred, which may warrant a visit to your ophthalmologist. Bert said if at any point during an eclipse viewing you begin to see little flashes of light or the experience becomes uncomfortable, you should look away from the sun immediately. A total solar eclipse occurs on April 8, 2024 with the path of totality crossing a large region of the United States. Whether viewing a partial or total solar eclipse, prioritizing eye safety can prevent permanent damage from solar retinopathy. If you plan to participate in this astronomical event, wear eclipse glasses with an ISO 12312-2 filter when looking at the sun, and do not remove your glasses until after you’ve looked away. If using binoculars, a telescope, or a camera of any kind, an appropriate solar filter should be applied to the lens. Of course, you should also wear sunscreen and sun-protective clothing if spending more than a few minutes outside. “A total solar eclipse is an exciting and rare event that people should certainly experience if they’re motivated to do so,” Hashad said. “I would just encourage everyone to do their research and be mindful of their eye health when viewing.” Additional safety guidelines for watching the total solar eclipse 2024 can be found on NASA’s website."," A total solar eclipse will travel across North America on April 8, 2024, with the path of totality visible in several major U.S. cities.
