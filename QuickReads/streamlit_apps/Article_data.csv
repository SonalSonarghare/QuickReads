Health,1,Eating Ultra-Processed Foods Linked to 32 Health Issues Like Heart Disease,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/eating-ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-32-health-issues-like-heart-disease,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/fast-food-drivethru-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,29-02-24,"A new study suggests that consumption of ultra-processed foods is linked to 32 adverse health outcomes like cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes�",Eating Ultra-Processed Foods Linked to These 32 Major Health Issues,"A new study finds ultra-processed foods like soda, candy, and prepackaged meat can lead to an increased risk of health issues such as cancer and heart disease. The study found that consumption of ultra-processed foods accounts for up to 58% of the daily calorie intake in high-income countries like the United States.

They found that eating large amounts of ultra-processed foods was linked to a 50% increased risk of cardiovascular disease-related death. High exposure to ultra-processed foods like sodas, candy, pre-packaged meat, sugary cereals, and potato chips is connected to an increased risk of 32 health issues including cancer, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disorders, depression, anxiety, and early death, according to a new study published in The BMJ on February 28.

The study found that consumption of ultra-processed foods accounts for up to 58% of daily calorie intake in high-income countries like the United States. Middle- and low-income countries have also notably increased their consumption of them in recent years.

The people who ate more of these foods were at an increased risk for depression, type 2 diabetes, and fatal heart attacks.

What are ""ultra-processed"" foods? Ultra-processed foods, which also include instant noodles, ready-made meals, and other packaged snacks like chips or cookies, are mostly made out of ""chemically modified substances extracted from foods, along with additives to enhance taste, texture, appearance, and durability, with minimal to no inclusion of whole foods,"" the study says. They have been processed industrially, with added flavors and colors, and have high amounts of salt, fat, and sugar and low amounts of vitamins essential to a healthy diet.

Evidence from the study points to alarming connections between eating high levels of processed foods and developing a number of health problems. The researchers reported there was ""convincing evidence"" of the following conditions being linked to eating ultra-processed foods: Around a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death, up to a 53% higher risk of anxiety and common mental health conditions, and a 12% greater risk of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, the researchers there was ""highly suggestive evidence"" of the following: A 21% greater risk of death from any cause, a 40-66% increased risk of heart disease-related death, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and sleep disorders, and a 22% higher risk of depression.

""These findings support urgent mechanistic research and public health actions that seek to target and minimize ultra-processed food consumption for improved population health,"" the study authors concluded.

Why are ultra-processed foods such a huge part of American diets? Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS, a registered dietician at the Cleveland Clinic Department of Wellness & Preventive Medicine in Ohio and a senior fellow at the Meadows Behavioral Healthcare in Wickenburg, Arizona, who was not involved in the study, told Healthline that ultra-processed foods (UPF) are cheap and prevalent in everyday shopping options. ""UPF are typically highly hyperpalatable. That means it's hard to stop eating them, and when you are not eating them, you may very well be craving them,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""They may even make you feel calm and content while consuming them � so there are reasons why we start eating them and can't stop."" Melanie Murphy Richter, a registered dietitian nutritionist and the director of communications for the nutrition company Prolon, who was not involved in the study, told Healthline that economic factors and the time crunch of many American schedules, combined with the difficulty of parsing food labels and marketing, can make UPF an easy choice. There are also emotional factors, she said. ""In my practice, I often have my patients answer a variety of intake questions that help me understand the strongest motives behind their food choices. For some people, it's simply because these are comforting foods they knew as a kid or that their grandparents made for them,"" Richter said. ""Other people, it's price. And ultra-processed foods are absolutely cheaper than healthier alternatives. For others, it's emotional. People eat because they are stressed, sad, or angry. And it just so happens that the foods our body wants during these emotional experiences are� sugar!""

How do ultra-processed foods contribute to anxiety and depression? The increased risks of sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and common mental health disorders that UPF pose are connected to a number of different ways they interact with our bodies, Richter said. She pointed to four key areas: glucose spikes and crashes, gut imbalances, inflammation (which is linked to many mood disorders), and nutritional deficiencies from a lack of vitamins. Because UPF are so high in added sugars, extreme swings in glucose regulation can create mood swings and irritability, which can lead to depression over time. ""High sugar diets have shown to decrease the production of necessary neurotransmitters like serotonin, which plays an important role in mood regulation and mental well-being,"" Richter said. ""Additionally, high intake of sugar preferentially feeds pathogenic (harmful) bacteria in our gut like yeast and mold which can lead to severe dysbiosis. These pathogenic bugs can block or hinder our ability to produce necessary hormones like serotonin that keep us calm and relaxed. In fact, just shy of half of all those who reported having IBS or IBD also report having either anxiety or depression."" Kirkpatrick also noted that the amount of UPF consumed can be directly proportional to the level of depression or anxiety: ""Some studies also show an impact with the amount as well � as consumption of UPF goes up, so may risk for adverse mental health outcomes,"" she said.

Takeaway: A new study suggests that consumption of ultra-processed foods is linked to 32 adverse health outcomes like cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, and early death. Ultra-processed foods, which include store-bought cookies, prepackaged snacks, processed meats, sugary cereals, and sodas, are cheap and easy to obtain. Researchers say consuming large amounts of ultra-processed foods can disrupt gut health, cause glucose spikes, and contribute to chronic inflammation, all of which have negative impacts on mental health."
Health,2,"CDC Tells Physicians to Conserve Tetanus Shots, Warns of Upcoming Shortage",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/tetanus-shot-shortage-cdc-guidance,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/waiting-room-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,29-02-24,The CDC issued new guidance for doctors about administering tetanus shots in advance of an upcoming shortage.,What to Know About the Tetanus Shot Shortage,"The CDC is urging healthcare professionals to conserve their supply of the Td vaccine, a type of tetanus shot, in advance of an upcoming shortage. Doctors should administer the Tdap vaccine instead of the Td vaccine when possible to protect against tetanus. Experts say the widely available Tdap vaccine is the preferred tetanus shot since it also protects against whooping cough.

If you've ever been to the emergency room to treat a serious wound, you probably received a tetanus shot. As the most commonly administered vaccine in the ER, tetanus shots are used to protect against tetanus, an infection caused by Clostridium tetani bacteria. However, health officials say a common type of tetanus vaccine may soon be in short supply.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is advising healthcare professionals to preserve the Td vaccine, also known as TdVax, which protects against tetanus and diphtheria infections. The new guidance follows a recent announcement from the vaccine's manufacturer, MassBiologics, that it would discontinue production of the shot. Grifols, the sole supplier of TdVax, anticipates running out of the vaccine by June 2024, the CDC shared with its vaccine advisory panel on Wednesday.

The CDC reports that Sanofi, the only other manufacturer of a Td vaccine licensed and approved for use in the United States, is ramping up its supply of the shot. The Tdap vaccine will continue to be widely available for use against tetanus without supply constraints. The CDC says doctors should administer the Tdap vaccine instead of Td. The Tdap vaccine also offers protection against pertussis or whooping cough. In most cases, Tdap and Td shots are used interchangeably among older children and adults. Younger children under 7 receive the DTap vaccine. ""Based on the rarity of developing a contraindication to pertussis-containing vaccines, the temporarily constrained supply of Td vaccine is not anticipated to prevent providers from utilizing Td vaccine for these children in the VFC program,"" the CDC told its vaccine panel.

Should you be concerned about the tetanus shot shortage? Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Healthline that one reason for the shortage of the Td shot is there's no longer a market for it. The Tdap vaccine, he said, is the preferred tetanus vaccine.

""I'm a little concerned about the language in talking about shortage because there is no shortage in Tdap,"" Schaffner said. ""From a public health point of view, there's no real concern because there's plenty of Tdap, [we] just have to persuade the small number of providers that are still using Td to use Tdap instead.""

Tdap is the preferred tetanus shot because it contains acellular pertussis, which provides protection against whooping cough. ""That's an immunization where the protection begins to wane fairly substantially,"" he said. ""That's why it's preferred to be used in these circumstances because you'll also get protection against whooping cough, and we want to reduce that as much as possible.""

While infants are most at risk for severe illness and death from whooping cough, this disease can impact individuals of all ages, Schaffner said, regardless of whether they are unvaccinated or have waning immunity.

""It's a historical disease,"" he said. ""That's why we immunize widely. That's why we vaccinate children as early as possible, starting at 2 months, and why it is recommended that everyone who has contact with a newborn should be up to date with their Tdap immunizations because adults and older siblings and other children can bring the bacteria Bordetella pertussis to the infant.""

Dr. Monica Gandhi, MPH, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, echoed the Tdap vaccine's protective benefits against whooping cough but noted it may not be as cost-effective for healthcare professionals compared to the Td vaccine. While the cost of the Tdap vaccine is slightly higher, both vaccines are typically covered by insurance.

""The discontinuation of the vaccine that protects for both tetanus and diphtheria called Td is disappointing because it means that clinics will now have to stock the more expensive Tdap vaccine,"" Gandhi told Healthline.

""I suspect that this will not cut down on vaccination rates, but will mean that the more expensive vaccine formulation for three different pathogens will be stocked by clinics,"" she said.

Why you should get a tetanus shot Tetanus is a bacterial infection affecting the nervous system and muscles, particularly the neck and jaw. But with the help of vaccines, tetanus has essentially been eradicated. The CDC recommends tetanus shots for all individuals after the childhood vaccine series every 10 years since these vaccinations do not provide lifelong immunity. There are three types of tetanus shots used in the U.S. to protect against tetanus and other infectious diseases, but only pertussis-containing vaccines protect against whooping cough:

DTap vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis Tdap: tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis Td vaccines: tetanus and diphtheria

Infants and children under 7 receive DTap shots whereas older children and adults receive Tdap and Td. Common side effects of a tetanus shot include soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site. Some individuals may experience a rash.

In rare cases, tetanus shots containing pertussis may cause a severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis. People allergic to vaccines containing pertussis should continue to receive the Td vaccine only.

Each tetanus shot works with different effectiveness, Schaffner explained, but all are effective at protecting against tetanus. Schaffner, who spoke with Healthline during a two-day meeting with the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said tetanus shots have been ""brilliantly successful"" at eliminating tetanus and diphtheria in the U.S.

""Vaccines have the capacity to eliminate diseases almost completely,"" he said. ""With tetanus, it's extraordinary because the bacteria that causes tetanus hasn't disappeared � it's in the soil all around us, it's environmentally constant. So what we've done is protected our entire population should they encounter this bacteria,"" Schaffner said.

Takeaway The CDC has issued new guidance for healthcare professionals about administering the tetanus shot in advance of an upcoming shortage. The federal agency says doctors should use the Tdap vaccine instead of the Td vaccine, reserving the latter for high-risk patients allergic to pertussis only. Tetanus shots are recommended every 10 years to protect against serious bacterial infection and whooping cough. If you can't remember the last time you had a tetanus shot, it may be time to call your doctor."

Health,4,�Scandal� Star Bellamy Young: I Didn�t Know Cirrhosis Could Affect My Dad�s Brain,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/bellamy-young-cirrhosis,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bellamy-young-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,29-02-24,"Actor Bellamy Young shares details about her late father�s battle with hepatic encephalopathy, a complication that can occur in people living with�",Cirrhosis: What Bellamy Young Wishes She Knew About Dad�s Diagnosis,"�Scandal� star Bellamy Young is working to raise awareness of hepatic encephalopathy.
Her father passed away shortly after being diagnosed with the disease when she was only 15 years old.
Hepatic encephalopathy is a complication that can occur in people who are living with cirrhosis.
The condition occurs when a person�s liver fails to filter out toxins properly, which can accumulate in the bloodstream, ultimately impairing brain function.
Actor Bellamy Young can vividly recall when her late father�s health started to take a noticeable turn for the worse.

�He was an auditor, and at a certain point, the numbers stopped making sense to him, which, numbers were like air to him, his whole world, and we were like, �Woah,'� she said. �Then, [he started showing signs of] anger, and he was also not �that guy.'�
However, Young says her family�s concern reached new heights when, one day, her father couldn�t find his way home from the office building where he�d worked for over 25 years.
Young�s dad had already been living with cirrhosis, marked by severe liver scarring, for some time, but they had no idea his condition could also affect his brain.
Her father was ultimately diagnosed with overt hepatic encephalopathy, or HE, which involves a decline in a person�s brain function, fueled by the presence of severe liver disease.

He was 53 years old when he received his diagnosis and passed away two years later.
Today, Young � whom many people know from her role as First Lady Mellie Grant in the hit TV series �Scandal� � is using her platform to help spread awareness about hepatic encephalopathy.
She partnered with Salix Pharmaceuticals on UnderstandingHE.com, so that more people can have the information that she and her family didn�t at the time of her dad�s diagnosis.
She hopes sharing her story will help others who are living with cirrhosis and HE, as well as their families and caregivers.

Hepatic encephalopathy can be a �hidden disease�
Young said that it�s still jarring to think about how little her family knew about her dad�s health at the time.

�We couldn�t have fathomed to correlate [these cognitive changes with] a diagnosis of a disease in his liver,� she said. �It was really scary and confusing, and we felt so alone. So much has changed now.�

However, Sammy Saab, MD, AGAF, MPH, a professor in the Departments of Medicine and Surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said hepatic encephalopathy is difficult to diagnose because it can often resemble other conditions.

�Unfortunately, when you get cirrhosis, a number of complications occur, and an important complication is hepatic encephalopathy. The numbers vary depending on how you define hepatic encephalopathy because hepatic encephalopathy is a spectrum of mental confusion, and it can occur depending on severe liver disease from 25-80% of people with cirrhosis,� Saab explained.

�We have a hard time diagnosing it. There�s not a specific blood test that says you might have hepatic encephalopathy,� he added.

For example, he mentioned a patient he worked with once who came in thinking they might have dementia or hepatitis C, but in reality, it was hepatic encephalopathy.

Hepatic encephalopathy causes and symptoms
The condition occurs when a person�s liver fails to filter out toxins properly. These materials will accumulate in the bloodstream, ultimately impairing brain function.

This can manifest in symptoms like disorientation, mood changes, confusion, and anxiety, among others.

The American Liver Foundation reports that about 70% of people with cirrhosis will develop this degenerative condition. It�s a serious problem that is growing in prevalence.

Young said it�s �shocking� to see statistics show mortality rates have doubled for people with severe chronic liver disease and cirrhosis in the past 15 years.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reportsTrusted Source that the number of adults (18 or older) with a diagnosed liver disease totals 4.5 million. That�s 1.8% of people over the age of 18.

When asked what accounts for these high numbers, especially in recent years, Saab said that experts believe it�s due to �the increasing burden of fatty liver� in our society.

Fatty liver is an important cause of cirrhosis, liver cancers, and liver failure.

Additionally, he said that he and his colleagues are seeing people coming into their offices with alcohol-associated liver disease more frequently and pointed to the high number of articles and surveys that point to alcohol-associated liver disease in people at increasingly younger ages.

Saab said the big barrier to treating hepatic encephalopathy is getting a diagnosis. Once that hurdle is crossed, a number of therapies exist.

He said there are two main FDA-approved medications. One is a syrup called lactulose, and another is an oral antibiotic called Rifaximin.

He said people might start on lactulose and then go on the other or may be treated with a combination of these two medications.

Saab noted that he is on the speaker bureau for Rifaximin.

Combatting stigma associated with alcohol-associated liver disease
Stigma remains a major barrier to the treatment and diagnosis of alcohol-associated liver disease, which can lead to HE.

In fact, some people who may be experiencing symptoms might not speak about them with a healthcare professional because they feel ashamed.

�Stigma is a major barrier to healthcare because patients, unfortunately, are embarrassed to discuss their alcohol use or alcohol disorder, and physicians also have a hard time asking those important questions. There has been a movement now to change the terminology of both alcohol and fatty liver so these can become less stigmatizing,� Saab explained.

��Fatty liver� in particular, the name has been changed to metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease, for example�.so, there has been a big movement to de-stigmatize these conditions in patients, because they are barriers and it does inhibit appropriate medical interventions,� Saab added.

Stigma can also hold back family members and those who have cared for people who are living with liver disease from sharing their stories and passing along vital information to others in need.

Young said she herself had �a lot of reticence and a lot of fear� about sharing this piece of her family�s story. Part of that is due to the fact that this isn�t just her story � it�s her father�s, it�s her mother�s, it�s their family�s.

However, she�s found that telling others has helped her heal as well.

�[I spent] a lot of decades since [my father�s death] sort of working through the regret that I have of �how I couldn�t help more,� and �I didn�t know more,� and I�ve come to some forgiveness for myself for not knowing more and some gentleness,� she said. �So, yeah, that is the other reason I�m so happy to get to talk about this now and shout it from the rooftops.�"
Health,5,Using Cannabis Daily Linked to 42% Increase in Stroke Risk,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/using-cannabis-daily-linked-to-42-increase-in-stroke-risk,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/weed-grinder-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,29-02-24,"In a study of over 430,000 U.S. adults, researchers found that cannabis use was associated with increased cardiovascular risks, including heart attack,",Heart Disease: Daily Cannabis Use Can Increase Risk,"A new study finds that using cannabis daily can significantly increase your risk of heart disease. Using cannabis is associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, independent of tobacco use, according to a study of 430,000 adults. The risks were even present in cannabis users who had never used tobacco cigarettes or nicotine e-cigarettes.

Cannabis use may increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, a new study of over 430,000 U.S. adults found. This association was present even after researchers took into account tobacco use and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Over 48 million Americans reported using cannabis at least once in 2019, with three in 10 people who use cannabis having cannabis use disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Although cannabis remains illegal at the federal level, 24 states and the District of Columbia have legalized it for recreational use, with additional states allowing medical use of cannabis, also known as marijuana.

This has led to an increase in the use of cannabis among adults over the past decade, even as cigarette smoking rates have dropped since the 1960s.

�Despite common use, little is known about the risks of cannabis use and, in particular, the cardiovascular disease risks,� said study author Abra Jeffers, PhD, a data analyst at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

�However, previous research suggested that cannabis could be associated with cardiovascular disease,� she said. �In addition, smoking cannabis � the predominant method of use � may pose additional risks because particulate matter is inhaled.�

In the study, published February 28 in the Journal of the American Heart Association, Jeffers and her colleagues reviewed data on 434,104 adults from 2016 to 2020 to examine the link between cannabis use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes (heart attack, stroke, and coronary heart disease).

Among all adults aged 18 to 74 years old, any cannabis use � whether smoked, ingested, or vaporized � was associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, researchers found. The risk was higher with more frequent cannabis use, but was present even among people who used it less often. For example, daily cannabis users had a 25% greater risk of heart attack and a 42% higher risk of stroke compared to non-users.

The results were similar even after researchers controlled for other cardiovascular risk factors such as use of tobacco cigarettes or nicotine e-cigarettes, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes, and physical activity level.

In a separate analysis, researchers found that cannabis users who had never smoked tobacco or used nicotine e-cigarettes still showed an increased risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack, or stroke.

In addition, younger adults at risk for premature cardiovascular disease � men younger than 55 years old and women younger than 65 years old � who used cannabis had a 36% higher risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack, or stroke.

Dr. Geoffrey C. Williams, clinical professor of internal medicine at University of Michigan Health, said the results show �there is a strong and consistent effect of cannabis smoking on heart attacks and strokes � even in younger individuals.�

Part of this increased risk may be due to breathing in fine particulate matter, which has been shown to damage blood vessels and the heart.

�We know that low amounts of exposure to smoke, even secondhand cannabis or tobacco smoke, substantially increases risk for stroke and heart attack,� Williams told Healthline.

One study in rats also showed that exposure to just one minute of secondhand cannabis smoke impaired the functioning of blood vessels.

Williams cautions that cannabis smoke contains more than just tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active component of cannabis. Those other chemicals may also have negative effects on the heart and blood vessels.

The bottom line: �When people consider taking anything, be aware of the effects of all the contents of the substance,� he said, adding that �smoking is never a safe way to take drugs.�

Smoke inhalation is just one potential way for cannabis to harm the heart and blood vessels, the authors of the new study point out.

For example, some research suggests that cannabis may have negative effects by activating cannabinoid receptors found throughout the cardiovascular system. In addition, THC can affect blood flow in a way that may increase the risk of stroke and heart attack.

The new study had some limitations, including its observational nature, which means researchers can�t show cause-and-effect, only that there is an association.

Also, researchers relied on participants to report their cardiovascular risk factors and whether they had a heart attack or stroke. They also didn�t have data on participants� blood pressure or cholesterol levels, two other key cardiovascular risk factors. However, Dr. Guy L. Mintz, director of Cardiovascular Health & Lipidology at Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, pointed out that even without knowing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, researchers still saw a strong link between cannabis use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

However, people with uncontrolled blood pressure or high cholesterol may be at higher risk from cannabis. Additional studies would be needed to assess that.

Loren E. Wold, PhD, a professor in the Department of Surgery at The Ohio State University, in Columbus, Ohio, also thinks more research is needed on the heart-related effects of edibles.

Cannabis edibles can include gummies, brownies, cookies, and other products, with some edibles having very high THC levels.

While the study included people who used cannabis edibles or vaped cannabis, the researchers didn�t look at the cardiovascular risks for these groups separately.

So, �there needs to be more work done on the type of edible, not just whether it�s an edible or not, but the actual type of edible,� Wold told Healthline.

We need to really look at �what the potential risks are of all the various types of cannabis products,� he said, �and that�s going to take a significant amount of time.�

Some of the shortcomings of the new study could be addressed in future research, such as by enrolling participants and following them from that point forward to see how many develop cardiovascular problems.

With this kind of prospective study, research teams could use medical records to verify whether a person had a heart attack or stroke, and measure blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors directly. They could also gather more detailed information about cannabis use, including frequency and types of products.

In spite of the limitations of the new study, Mintz said the findings are a wake-up call for both the general public and physicians about the potential risks of cannabis.

�This is an opportunity for people who engage in cannabis use, recreationally or medically, to talk to their doctor and review their other cardiovascular risks,� Mintz told Healthline, especially those who already know they are at higher risk of heart problems.

Physicians should also routinely ask patients about cannabis use, he said, the way they assess blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, and other factors.

�Cannabis use could be considered another potential cardiovascular risk factor,� he said, �one that�s overlooked.�

Wold said the new findings will also allow people to weigh the risks and benefits of cannabis, which is especially important in middle-aged and older adults, who may have other cardiovascular risk factors.

�Cannabis products can be effective for treating sleeplessness or chronic pain,� said Wold. �But is using cannabis worth the risk of compromised cardiac function?�

In conclusion, the study of over 430,000 U.S. adults found that cannabis use was associated with

 increased cardiovascular risks, including heart attack, stroke, and coronary heart disease. The risk was higher with more frequent cannabis use. Even in people who had never used tobacco cigarettes or nicotine e-cigarettes, cannabis use was linked to a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Younger people saw a similar risk with cannabis use."

Consuming flavonol, a naturally occurring chemical compound in fruits and vegetables, is one key to good health. In a new study, higher consumption of flavonol was associated with a lower risk of death from conditions like cancer and cardiovascular disease. Experts emphasize that eating plenty of fruits and vegetables is essential to ensure an adequate intake of flavonol.

Flavonols, which are chemical compounds found in various colorful fruits and vegetables, offer a wide range of health benefits, including improving outcomes for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and more. These compounds, which possess antioxidant properties, are found in foods such as onions, apples, tomatoes, and coffee, and are part of a larger class of naturally occurring chemicals known as flavonoids, regularly consumed in plant-derived food and drink.

A large population study of nearly 12,000 US adults provided further evidence supporting the health benefits of flavonol consumption. Researchers found that individuals who consumed more flavonol had lower overall mortality rates, as well as lower rates of cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the study revealed a dose-dependent effect, indicating that higher consumption was associated with better outcomes compared to lower consumption levels.

The study, published in Scientific Reports on February 25, underscores the importance of eating more fruits and vegetables for overall health. ""I�m not at all surprised at the results of the study as many previous studies have shown an association between flavonoids and reduction of risk of several diseases as well as mortality risk,"" said Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS RD, a Dietitian with Cleveland Clinic.

Additionally, researchers were able to identify specific health outcomes associated with individual flavonol compounds, such as quercetin, providing further insight into their effects on disease prevention.

To identify the associations between flavonol and mortality risk, researchers utilized electronic records from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Over an average follow-up period of eight years, participants' flavonol consumption was tracked, and associations with mortality risk were observed.

Consuming more flavonol-rich foods was linked to a reduced risk of death from various causes, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Myricetin, a flavonol compound, showed the strongest association with reduced risk of Alzheimer�s disease. However, there was no association found between flavonol consumption and mortality risk from diabetes.

To ensure an adequate intake of flavonol, experts recommend consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables. ""I advise my patients to get a variety of deeply-hued plants in their diet daily...Just get more color and vary the color! It�s great to have a kale salad every day but this is only giving you one deep color. Add berries to your salad, or choose different plants each night to get different colors in,"" said Kirkpatrick.

Rather than focusing on consuming a specific amount of flavonol, individuals are encouraged to prioritize incorporating more fresh fruits and vegetables into their diet. ""For the average person, I would not focus on trying to get a certain amount of any sort of phytochemical. I would just focus on trying to get in, you know, five to seven servings of fruit and vegetables,"" said Katherine Donelan, MS, RD, an oncology dietitian with Stanford Health Care.

In conclusion, consuming a variety of flavonol-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables, can contribute to reducing mortality risk from various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Ensuring a diverse and colorful diet is key to obtaining adequate flavonol intake and promoting overall health."
Health,7,Boiling Water May Help Remove Up to 90% of Microplastics,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/boiling-water-may-help-remove-up-to-90-of-microplastics,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/boiling-water-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,28-02-24,"Boiling and filtering your tap water may dramatically lower the amount of microplastics you drink, according to new research. Scientists are just�",Boiling Water Can Remove 90% of Microplastics From Your Tap Water,"A new study suggests that boiling water can significantly reduce the amount of microplastics you consume, potentially lowering health risks associated with microplastic exposure. Microplastics, which are tiny bits of plastic as small as one-thousandth of a millimeter in diameter, have been found in various products and even in tap water. The study, published in Environmental Science & Technology Letters on February 28, found that boiling mineral-rich water for just five minutes can decrease exposure to microplastics by up to 90%.

Nano- and microplastics are increasingly recognized as a health concern, with evidence indicating that they can accumulate in the body and lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, and liver issues. While certain advanced water filtration systems can remove some microplastics from tap water, researchers sought simpler and more accessible methods, especially for regions lacking such technology.

Boiling water was identified as a straightforward solution to remove microplastics. The process involves boiling tap water for five minutes, which creates a chalky residue called limescale, composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This residue can trap microplastics, which can then be separated and removed from the water using a standard coffee filter or stainless steel filter.

The effectiveness of this method depends on the hardness of the water, with harder water resulting in greater removal of microplastics. Boiling hard water with high mineral content, such as calcium or magnesium, was found to remove nearly 90% of microplastics, while softer water with lower mineral content removed approximately 25%.

Microplastics are commonly found in groundwater and surface water due to wastewater and surface runoff. Traditional water treatment plants are not equipped to eliminate microplastics, and advanced filtration systems are not widely available, especially in developing countries. Thus, boiling water presents a practical and accessible solution to reduce microplastic exposure.

However, it's important to note that while boiling water can mitigate microplastic ingestion, it may not eliminate exposure from other sources. Therefore, individuals can further reduce exposure by avoiding single-use plastic packaging, minimizing the use of plastic utensils and containers, and choosing alternative materials whenever possible.

In conclusion, boiling and filtering tap water can significantly decrease microplastic intake, potentially mitigating associated health risks. While more research is needed to fully understand the impact of microplastic exposure on health, taking proactive steps to limit exposure is advisable."
Health,8,She Took Compounded Ozempic to Lose 10 Pounds and Ended Up in the ER with Appendicitis,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/compounded-ozempic-appendicitis,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/female-water-rearview-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,27-02-24,"Amy Jenson began taking a compounded form of Ozempic, hoping to lose 10 pounds for her wedding. Then, the day after her ceremony, she was rushed to�",I Took Compounded Ozempic. Then I Got Appendicitis,"One woman shares her story of having appendicitis while taking a compounded version of semaglutide.
The FDA has raised concerns about compounded forms of semaglutide, which may not be safe or effective.
More research is needed to determine if there is a connection between taking any form of semaglutide and appendicitis.
[Amy Jenson�s name was changed in this story to protect her privacy.]

A year before her wedding, Amy Jenson was determined to lose 10 to 15 pounds to reach her target weight of 126 pounds and fit perfectly into her dress.

For 8 months, she tried the ketogenic diet, which had worked for her in the past.

Around the same time, she had a visit with her naturopathic doctor. Based on her A1C blood glucose test results, which showed Jenson was on the verge of prediabetes, the doctor recommended semaglutide to help control her blood sugar levels.

When Jenson learned that weight loss was a possible side effect of semaglutide, she decided to take the medication for both reasons.

Semaglutide is better known by the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy.

She got semaglutide + B12 from a compounding pharmacy and started at a low dose with slow increases each month.

�I got some side effects � two stomach issues over four months�that came and went [with] severe stomachache and lasted 8 hours,� said Jenson. �I felt full all the time, was constipated, and taking magnesium at night to have bowel movements.�

After three months on the medication, she lost 10 pounds and reached her goal weight. However, she kept taking it for another month until the week before her wedding for fear of gaining the weight backTrusted Source.

�The day after my wedding, I woke up at 3 a.m. with a really bad stomachache, sick out of both ends,� said Jenson.

Her wedding was out of the country, and she planned to fly back to the United States the next day.

�The pain got so severe, and I had to go to the emergency room, and they gave me a CT scan right away and told me my appendix was so swollen and impacted with fecal matter that [it] started an infection and�that I needed emergency surgery,� said Jenson.

She underwent an appendectomy to remove her appendix and was able to fly home 72 hours later.

Can semaglutide cause appendicitis?
While it�s not clear exactly what causes appendicitis, some possible causes includeTrusted Source:

hardened stool or growths that can block the opening inside the appendix
enlarged tissue in the wall of the appendix that is caused by infection in the digestive tract or another area of the body
inflammatory bowel disease
Dr. Karl Nadolsky, endocrinologist and diplomate at the American Board of Obesity Medicine, said that any connection between semaglutide and appendicitis has not been noted in large randomized trials.

However, he pointed to one case that was reported in a person with end-stage kidney disease who took a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) that is not semaglutide.

Additionally, a case report found that based on current trial results and adverse event reporting systems, there is an infrequent incidence of appendicitis in patients using GLP-1RAs.

�This does not seem like a clinical concern if using the real medicine that was studied and approved,� Nadolsky told Healthline.

While there is currently no data showing an increase in the risk of appendicitis from taking GLP-1 medications, Dr. David Renton, clinical associate professor of surgery specializing in minimally invasive abdominal surgery at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and College of Medicine, told Healthline, �a dedicated study would help us show if there is a correlation between the two.�

He added that while appendicitis is rare, it can occur at any age. The most common symptoms are:

Nausea
Vomiting
Abdominal pain, usually starting around the belly button, then slowly centering in the right lower quadrant
�If you are having abdominal pain that lasts more than two days and is not relieved by medications or bowel movements, please seek medical attention,� said Renton. �Early appendicitis is easy to treat; late and perforated appendicitis usually has a longer hospital stay and can have weeks of treatment until it resolves completely.�

Compounded forms of Ozempic and Wegovy are causing concern
Nadolsky said that formulations of the brand Ozempic like compounded semaglutide + B-12 have been created and sold due to a loophole in legality.

For instance, when a drug is in shortageTrusted Source like Ozempic and Wegovy currently are, the FDA states that compounders are legally able to prepare a compounded version of the drug if they meet certain requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act.

Nadolsky stressed that people should avoid compounded versions of medications.

�For any medicine, clinically anticipated benefits must far outweigh potential risks. These medications have now been inappropriately prescribed, or obtained from med spas or online �clinics� in the form of compounded semaglutide +/- B12, in such a manner that the benefit-risk ratio may be discordant,� he said.

In January 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) posted a statementTrusted Source that said people should not use a compounded drug if an approved drug is available, noting that people and healthcare providers should know that the FDA does not review compounded versions of these drugs for safety, effectiveness, or quality.

The FDA also noted that it has received adverse reports from people who have used compounded semaglutide, and that some compounders may be using salt forms of semaglutide. It wrote:

�The salt forms are different active ingredients than is used the approved drugs, which contain the base form of semaglutide. The agency is not aware of any basis for compounding using the salt forms that would meet the FD&C requirements for types of active ingredients that can be compounded.�

Nadolsky added that any form of anti-obesity medication should only be prescribed for those who meet the requirements.

�Semaglutide and other GLP-1RAs should be reserved for those with obesity and severe clinical disease like type 2 diabetes or other complications or at very high risk of complications which will keep the benefit to risk ratio appropriate,� he said.

First-hand warning about taking semaglutide
Looking back at her choice to take semaglutide, Jenson said she doesn�t regret taking the compounded version; however, she does regret taking it in any form.

In addition to appendicitis, she is also concerned that her blood glucose levels are erratic now that she hasn�t taken the medication for two months and wonders whether the medication affected her pancreas.

�I knew instinctively I shouldn�t be doing it, but I justified it because all these biohackers in health and wellness were touting peptides, and semaglutide is a peptide,� she said.

She hopes biohackers and influencers promoting health and wellness and ways to enhance longevity and brain function will also share more of the possible side effects of GLP-1s in the future.

�I�m responsible for myself at the end of the day,� said Jenson. �But this isn�t for everyone; it�s not without [risk of] adverse effects.�"
Health,9,Wendy Williams: How Early Signs of Aphasia and Dementia Can Be Overlooked,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/wendy-williams-dementia-early-signs,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/wendy-williams-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,27-02-24,Talk show host Wendy Williams has been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These are the early warning�,Wendy Williams and Dementia: Early Warning Signs That Can be Missed,"Wendy Williams has been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and dementia.
The announcement follows years of speculation about the talk show host�s health.
Experts say an early sign of primary progressive aphasia can be problems with speech.
Following a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk for dementia.
However, the condition is progressive, and there is no known cure.
On February 22, 2024, it was announced via a press release that talk show host Wendy Williams had been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

According to the National Institute on Aging, PPATrusted Source affects a person�s ability to speak, read, write, and understand speech. It can also lead to slurred speech, or a person may become unable to speak at all.

FTD can create problems with memory, reasoning, and judgment. It can also cause changes in behavior.

Her care team stated in the press release that they were making the announcement in response to �inaccurate and hurtful rumors about her health.�

The 59-year-old star, who has received several Daytime Emmy nominations for her long-running talk show, The Wendy Williams Show, was the subject of 2020 media reports detailing an incident where she was having problems speaking and called singer Adele �Hodele.�

There were also reports in 2022 of Williams drinking heavily and seeming incapable of comprehending that her popular talk show had been canceled.

A newly released documentary, Where Is Wendy Williams?, highlights her cognitive and emotional decline in the time leading up to her 2023 diagnosis of PPA and FTD.

It also addressed that she has been living with lymphedema and Grave�s disease.

In the press release, her team stated that she is currently receiving medical care at Weill Cornell Medicine.

Additionally, they noted that Williams remains able to do many things for herself but is receiving care to make sure she is protected and has her needs taken care of.

�The decision to share this news was difficult and made after careful consideration,� they wrote, �not only to advocate for understanding and compassion for Wendy but to raise awareness about aphasia and frontotemporal dementia and support the thousands of others facing similar circumstances.�

Early symptoms of frontotemporal dementia
Dr. Joel Salinas, Clinical Assistant Professor of Neurology at NYU Langone Health and Chief Medical Officer at Isaac Health, said that FTD can present in various forms, including those that affect language.

�Early symptoms of FTD with aphasia can be subtle and often go unnoticed because they might mimic everyday issues,� he explained.

�For instance, individuals may begin to experience difficulty finding the right words during conversations, which could easily be mistaken for stress or fatigue,� said Salinas. �There might also be changes in social behavior, such as diminished empathy, making inappropriate comments, or withdrawing from social interactions, which can be dismissed as mood swings or personal choices.�

Salina went on to note that people with FTD might experience lapses in their cleanliness or grooming, but these could be rationalized away as simply laziness.

�Some might start repeating words or engaging in compulsive behaviors (e.g., gambling), which may not immediately be recognized as symptoms of a neurological condition,� he added.

Other signs, according to Salinas, could be changes in dietary preferences. For example, a person might start overeating or develop a taste for sweets that wasn�t there before.

�Finally, the condition may also present with changes in motor function affecting movement,� he stated, �such as frequent falls or symptoms of weakness or rigidity that can sometimes resemble Parkinson�s disease.�

How to reduce your risk for frontotemporal dementia
According to the Alzheimer�s Society, about 10 to 15 out of every 100 people with FTD have a faulty gene that causes the disease. If your parent has that gene, there is a 1 in 2 chance you will inherit it.

However, it causes the behavioral variant of FTD rather than the PPA variant that Williams has, so it mainly affects the person�s behavior rather than their speech.

Genetic testing can help you assess your risk for this form of FTD.

Dr. Gary Small, a memory, brain, and aging expert at Hackensack Meridian Health, said that there are also other factors that affect your risk of developing dementia.

�Although genetics play a role, as with any dementia, potentially modifiable lifestyle behaviors can reduce risk and delay symptom onset, including regular physical exercise, healthy diet, stress management, not smoking, and mental stimulation,� he explained.

Unfortunately, once you have the condition, there is little you can do, according to Small.

�The disease has no cure, and as the illness progresses, patients lose their ability to remember and reason and develop movement problems, including balancing and swallowing,� he stated. �Patients also are at risk for depression and may develop inappropriate social behavior.�

Takeaway
The care team for former talk show host Wendy Williams recently announced that the star has been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia.

This comes after several years of rumors about the state of her mental health.

Early symptoms are subtle and can go unnoticed but may include such things as speech difficulties, mood swings, or social withdrawal.

Certain lifestyle behaviors can reduce your risk and delay the onset of symptoms. These include exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, managing stress, not smoking, and getting adequate mental stimulation.

However, the condition is progressive and has no known cure."
Health,10,CDC Norovirus Data Shows Cases are Rising in These U.S. Regions,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/cdc-norovirus-data-shows-cases-are-rising-in-these-u-s-regions,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sick-child-parent-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,27-02-24,"Norovirus, sometimes known as the �stomach flu,� is spreading in the United States, especially in the Northeast, based on trends from the CDC.",Norovirus: CDC Data Shows Cases are on the Rise,"Cases of norovirus, a highly transmissible �stomach flu,� are on the rise in the US, especially in the North East, according to the CDC.
The virus spreads more frequently during the winter months, causing severe vomiting and diarrhea.
Typically symptoms only last a few days and do not pose a serious concern for otherwise healthy individuals.
Cases of norovirus, a highly transmissible virus responsible for severe �stomach flu,� are on the rise nationally.

Data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this monthTrusted Source showed cases of norovirus rising throughout the U.S., especially in the Northeastern United States and in western states.

Why norovirus spreads so easily
�Norovirus clearly is an extraordinarily transmissible virus. It�s said that it takes only about 10 viral particles, if you get them in your system, to initiate an infection. That�s really a very small dose,� Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told Healthline.

Nationally, the number of positive norovirus cases is just over 12% but appears to be trending upward, according to the latest surveillance data from the CDC.Trusted Source

Last year, norovirus peaked in early March, which could indicate that there�s a final wave coming before rapidly tapering off into the spring, based on historical data.

However, the national trends don�t tell the whole story. Norovirus is appearing more frequently in the Northeastern and western United States.

In the Northeast, positive norovirus cases are 13% above the national average and have been for several weeks.

The next hardest-hit region is the western states, where cases are tracking similarly to the national average at around 12%. Both southern and midwest states are currently below the national average with 9% and 10% positive cases, respectively.

It�s unclear what is causing these regional variations.

Despite the current upward trend, overall cases of norovirus are not as widespread both nationally and regionally as they were in 2023.

This time last year, positive norovirus cases were at more than 14% nationally and 14-15% in the Northeast.

Why norovirus cases are surging right now
Like the flu, norovirus, which is also known by another colorful name, �winter vomiting disease,� tends to ebb and flow with the seasons and, as its nickname suggests, is most prevalent in the winter months.

�The seasonality of illnesses, whether they�re respiratory viruses or, in this case, norovirus, which is basically an enteric virus, is not really well understood, but it is well described,� said Schaffner.

Winter is prime time for the spread of viruses, which among other reasons, is often attributed to more people gathering indoors together, which makes transmission easier.

�Norovirus circulates all year round, but many times we do see an uptick in the fall and first couple of months of the year while people are indoors,� said Dr. Judith O�Donnell, Section Chief of Infectious Diseases at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center and a Professor of Infectious Diseases at the University of Pennsylvania.

Norovirus is already an extremely transmissible virus, but combining it with situations in which people are frequently in close quarters, like in the winter, can significantly increase the risk.

Places where norovirus tends to spread most oftenTrusted Source are environments like schools, healthcare facilities, and cruise ships.

If someone in your home contracts the virus, there�s a high likelihood that someone else can get it as well.

�As meticulous as you are, you�re going to have to help deal with that sick person,� said Schaffner. �It�s very difficult to avoid infection because this agent is so highly infectious.�

Norovirus symptoms and early signs
Stomach bug, stomach flu, or viral gastroenteritis � no matter what you call it, the symptoms of norovirus are bad news.

Acute or viral gastroenteritis refers to the inflammation of the stomach or intestines.

�Norovirus makes you quite ill. You feel quite ill for two, maybe into three days. You feel as though you�re going to die,� said Schaffner, who clarified that most people recover within a few days.

The hallmark symptoms of norovirusTrusted Source include:

diarrhea
vomiting
nausea
stomach pain
Less common symptoms also include:

fever
headache
body aches
Symptoms typically occur between 12-48 hours after being exposed. Although the symptoms tend to clear in just three days, they could be an excruciating few days.

Healthy individuals don�t have much to worry about in terms of serious symptoms from norovirus, but it is more dangerous for certain populations, including the elderly and small children.

The most dangerous effect of norovirus is dehydration caused by vomiting and diarrhea.

Since there is no antiviral cure for norovirus, the best treatment is supportive care, especially drinking lots of fluids.

�It�s the dehydration from the vomiting and the diarrhea that can give you a hard time,� said Schaffner. �The most important part of that is fluid repletion. Try to take fluids in, often in small amounts, but steadily to try to replete your fluid balance,� he said.How does norovirus spread?
With norovirus, a little goes a long way, meaning it doesn�t take muchTrusted Source to get you sick. When someone has a norovirus infection, they may shed billions of viral particlesTrusted Source.

Norovirus commonly spreads through contaminated particles, such as feces or vomit.

The virus also spreads easily via a number of important pathways, including the following.

Food: Food can be contaminated by norovirus at any number of stages, from when it is harvested or prepared to when you put it into your mouth. If contamination occurs anywhere along this journey, it is possible for it to spread.
Water: Contaminated water is another way norovirus spreads. Water contamination can occur when sewage or septic systems leak into a clean water source. A sick individual can also contaminate water if they come into contact with it.
Surfaces: Like other viruses, norovirus can spread through surfaces. Contamination can occur from direct contact with a sick individual or spread from indirect particulate matter, such as when a sick individual vomits near a surface.
Due to the risk of contamination and spread through multiple avenues, the best prevention for norovirus is good hygiene. This includes common sense things like hand washing and regularly disinfecting surfaces.

�Frequent hand washing is the most important thing that you can do to try to prevent yourself from getting norovirus, and certainly always washing your hands after you use the bathroom and always washing your hands before you eat or drink,� said O�Donnell.

When preparing food, always wash fruits and vegetables. It�s also important to cook meat, poultry, and fish (including shellfish) to the correct temperature to ensure that any potential contamination has been neutralized.

Even if someone starts to feel better, norovirus can still be present in bodily fluids, so washing your hands and sanitizing surfaces are important both before and after symptoms are present.

The bottom line
Norovirus, sometimes known as the �stomach flu,� is spreading in the United States, especially in the Northeast, based on trends from the CDC.

The high-transmissible virus can cause severe diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea.

Symptoms typically pass within a few days. Since there is no cure for norovirus, prevention is key.

Good hygiene practices like frequently washing your hands and sanitizing surfaces are important prevention practices."

The research shows antidepressant use was escalating even before the COVID-19 pandemic.
While the rate of antidepressant use rose significantly for young females, the rate declined for males.
Experts say pandemic-related stress and previous mental health issues may be driving the rising rates.
Increased access to mental healthcare resources may also be leading to more antidepressant prescriptions.
Antidepressant use among young people has escalated in recent years, even before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since March 2020, the dispensing rate of antidepressants among young adults and adolescents increased significantly, according to a new study.

The findings were published February 26 in the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Researchers examined antidepressant prescriptions for young individuals in the United States ages 12�25 from 2016 to 2022, during which time the monthly antidepressant dispensing rate increased by 66.3%.

This rate rose 129.6% and 56.5% faster after March 2020 for female teens ages 12�17 and 18�25. Conversely, there was a decline among male teens and young adults in the same age groups.

Antidepressant use spiked during COVID-19
The AAP study adds to a growing body of evidenceTrusted Source demonstrating an increase in mental health concerns among young adults and teens.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of depression and suicidal ideationTrusted Source among young people were already rising. These rates increased furtherTrusted Source from 2020 onward and have extended beyond the pandemic.

During the pandemic, social isolation and academic disruption, loss of parents or caregivers to COVID-19, unemployment in the family, or being victims of physical or emotional abuse at home are considered possible factors driving the increase in mental health disorders.

�Prior researchTrusted Source has provided evidence that the stress, adversities, and social disruptions of the pandemic have contributed to a rise in mental health challenges and service needs for U.S. adolescents and young adults,� said Dr. Mark Olfson, MPH, professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

�With the onset of the pandemic, mental health services quickly pivoted to telemental health. For some young people, this provided a more convenient, private, and less stigmatizing means of providing mental healthcare, including initiation and monitoring treatment with antidepressant medications,� Olfson added.

Post-pandemic, young people are grappling with mounting concerns about social media use, mass violence, natural disasters, and climate change, explained Dr. Lokesh Shahani, MPH, a psychiatrist with UTHealth Houston.

�Antidepressants are important in the management of depression and anxiety in adolescents and young adults,� Shahani told Healthline. �The rise in antidepressant prescription is related to the rise in the prevalence of mental health conditions, as well as the receipt of care for these conditions.�

Antidepressant prescriptions higher among females
The new study indicates that female teens were far more likely to be prescribed antidepressants than males.

�The onset of depressive disorders peaks during puberty, and depression is known to be roughly twice as common among females than males after puberty, but not before when the prevalence is approximately equal for females and males,� Olfson explained.

Another plausible explanation, experts say, is that young males may be less likely to seek out and receive care for mental health symptoms compared to females.

Future research should investigate whether the decrease in antidepressant dispensing among male teens reflects the underuse of these medications relative to the level of need, Shahani said.

Olfson noted that telemental health, which became available at scale during the pandemic, may be more widely acceptable and used by young females than males.

�In the years leading up to the pandemic, there is evidence that while rates of depression were increasing among young people, little progress was made on closing the gap of unmet need for depression treatment among young people in the United States,� Olfson said.

�It is possible, but has not been established, that telemental health has helped to narrow the gap in unmet need for mental health treatment.�What are the side effects of antidepressants?
Antidepressants are generally well tolerated with minimal adverse effects that tend to be dose-dependent.

Most antidepressant side effects are mild and subside within 1 to 2 weeks or with a reduction in dosage, Shahani explained, noting that common side effects may include:

abdominal pain
nausea
diarrhea
agitation
jitteriness
headache
sleep changes
Serious adverse events from antidepressants are rare but may occur in some people.

For reasons that are not well understood, antidepressants may trigger an increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviors among a small percentage of young people. However, Olfson noted this risk appears to be highest early in treatment.

�With the increased use of antidepressants by young people, especially adolescent girls and young women, there is a need for careful vigilance concerning emerging suicidal symptoms so that appropriate support can be provided to young people who develop suicidal symptoms during antidepressant treatment,� he said.

Shahani added there�s a potential for increased suicidal ideation and behavior in pediatric patients who initiate treatment with antidepressants or with dose increases or decreases.

Antidepressants may also have adverse effects on people with bipolar disorder.

�The risk of patients with bipolar disorder switching from major depression to hypomania or mania due to treatment with antidepressants [also] needs to be considered,� Shahani said.

Lastly, people taking antidepressants should also be aware of potential drug interactions. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting antidepressants.

According to a new study, antidepressant use among young adults and teens rose nearly 64% from 2020 onward.

The rate of antidepressant dispensing was different among males and females. After 2020, the rate of antidepressant use increased significantly for young females, whereas the rate decreased for young males.

Experts suggest potential causes for this increase could be pandemic-related stress and anxiety and pre-existing mental health issues that became exacerbated.

Additionally, more awareness of mental health issues and better access to mental healthcare resources could also be contributing factors."

Hough explains how �Dancing with the Stars� inspired her to launch an online fitness platform.
Experts share the mental and physical benefits of dance, including weight loss.
Julianne Hough danced her way to stardom on ABC�s �Dancing with the Stars.�

While dancing has always been part of her life, in recent years, it has become about more than just the moves.

�I think dance was always my superpower without me realizing it until later on when I started going to therapy regularly and learning more about mental health and anxieties and depression,� she told Healthline.

About 10 years ago, she began researching the benefits of dance on the brain.

�[That�s] when I found out dance is probably one of the best ways to have that true mind/body/soul, mind/body/spirit, mind/body/connection; however you want to describe it,� said Hough.

Science says dance is good for your body, mind, and mood
Julia Basso, PhD, director of the Embodied Brain Laboratory at Virginia Tech, said her researchTrusted Source on dance and the brain found that at the behavioral level, dance increases positive, affective states and decreases negative affective states.

�[You�re] increasing your happy experiences, your positive feelings, and decreasing your negative feelings, such as depression, anxiety; things called negative affect,� she told Healthline.

Dance also taps into social and emotional processes and creative and rhythmic aspects.

�So altogether, we�re finding that beyond mental health capacities, it also enhances social health. When people dance and dance with one another, they often feel a social or connectedness to one another,� she said.

She is currently investigating how dancing together affects the brain by recording brain activity in different populations as they dance together, such as professional dancers, people living with disabilities, new moms, elderly living with Alzheimer�s disease, and more.

�While people dance with each other and are moving together and coordinating their physical actions, we can get people in similar brain states�and in essence, that gets folks to attune to each another on the sensory-motor level, which promotes socio-emotional engagements,� Basso said.

Hough brings new energy to dancing for everyone
To share the benefits of dance with the public, Hough launched the dance and fitness platform KINRGY in 2018. The platform offers classes in dance cardio, fitness, breathwork, meditation, sound healing, and more.

She said the classes and sessions are not about following them perfectly or technically but rather about finding a connection with music, movement, and people.

�[Our] whole philosophy is when you can connect to yourself and dance and really dive into your own authenticity, you can then relate to people around you better. Then when that happens, you can experience the world in a more true and expressive form,� said Hough.

For those who find dancing intimidating, she said the platform�s meditation and breathwork sessions are good places to start. However, she stressed the importance of dance as a personal expression.

�It�s not about doing it right or wrong, good or bad; we�ve created movements designed to have your body move the way it was designed to move or how it wants to move, and it�s about connection to your most authentic self,� she said.

In fact, �Dancing with the Stars� was her biggest motivation for this philosophy.

When working with celebrities, she learned to choreograph dances based on how their body naturally moved rather than forcing them to learn steps outside their comfort zone.

�The best trainers and the best coaches for their celebrity were the ones who would get their partner, and they would be like, �let�s just put some music on. Just feel the music and just walk or move around,�� said Hough.

After being repeatedly asked by fans if there was ever going to be a �Dancing with the Stars� for everyday people, Hough decided to create a platform based on how she trained celebrities.

�It�s not about teaching the steps to dance. You get somebody in a position where they can dance and feel confident and sexy and alive and free and not self-conscious, and they can connect with people and connect with themselves, and that�s what KINRGY is about,� she said.

This month, the platform opens its first brick-and-mortar location in West Hollywood in collaboration with Xponential Fitness.

How to dance your way to weight loss
While Hough looks to dance to add value to one�s life rather than simply to lose weight, she said on �Dancing with the Stars,� contestants would lose weight without trying.

�[Because] you�re focusing on your energy, the confidence, the joy, the freedom within your body, and so when that happens, the physical works for you in a way,� she said.

Dance as an activity can help a person burn calories, said Christina Brown, MS, ACSM CPT, nutrition and weight loss coach.

�In order to lose weight, you must be in a calorie deficit, meaning you must be taking in fewer calories than you are expending, or in other words eating fewer calories than you are burning,� she told Healthline.

You can be in a calorie deficit either by eating fewer calories, by burning more calories each day, or by a combination of both.

�Dancing can put you in a calorie deficit due to the calories that you are burning during the time you are dancing. Therefore, it can be helpful in weight loss,� said Brown.

To get an idea of how many calories are burned during 30 minutes of dance for a 150-pound person, see below:

Hip hop: 207 calories
Swing: 207 calories
Ballet: 179 calories
Country Western line dancing: 171 calories
Tap: 164 calories
Salsa: 143 calories
Ballroom: 118 calories
If you are planning to add dance to your weight loss plan, Brown recommends the following:

Start slow with one dance class per week, especially if you have not been exercising regularly the past several months. Increase classes as you become more fit.
Stay hydrated and drink water throughout the day as you will most likely be sweating during the dance class.
Warm up properly before each class to get your body ready for the activity.
Stretch at the end of the class in order to allow the body to cool down.
�Dancing is a great cardio activity that can help you burn more calories, however, I also recommend doing 2 to 3 days of strength training exercise per week in order to build muscle,� said Brown.

People lose about 3% to 8% of muscle massTrusted Source each decade starting at the age of 30.

The less muscle you have, the slower your metabolism will be, Brown added.

�Ensuring you don�t lose muscle mass as you age is important to maintaining your weight and not seeing the age-related weight gain that many people do.�"
Health,13,Weight Loss Combined with Exercise Can Cut Heart Attack Risk for People with Type 2 Diabetes,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/weight-loss-exercise-heart-attack-risk,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/older-male-walking-dog-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,26-02-24,Weight loss combined with physical activity can significantly reduce the risk of heart attack for people who are living with type 2 diabetes.,Weight Loss and Exercise Can Cut Heart Attack Risk by 61%,"A new study found that weight loss and physical activity dropped the risk of heart attacks by over 60% for people with type 2 diabetes.
The CDC estimates that about 38 million Americans or one in 10 have diabetes and 95% of them have type 2 diabetes.
Experts recommend people get on average about 150 minutes of exercise a week.
A new study finds that both weight loss and physical activity is key to helping drop heart attack risk for people with type 2 diabetes.

�According to a recent studyTrusted Source, weight loss combined with physical activity led to a 61% lower risk in heart attacks for people with type 2 diabetes when compared with individuals with type 2 diabetes with low physical activity and no weight loss. Additionally, maintaining a high level of physical activity with weight loss led to a greater reduction in risk than just losing weight alone.�

Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which glucose levels build up when the body cannot react to insulin effectively or is unable to produce enough of it. Treatment for type 2 diabetes most commonly involves careful monitoring of blood sugar levels and medications like metformin or sulfonylureas, but diet, weight management, and exercise are part of a broader approach.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTrusted Source, about 38 million Americans (one in 10, on average) have diabetes, and up to 95% of them have type 2 diabetes. The condition creates a significant risk for heart disease and heart attacks.

When that much glucose builds up in blood vessels, fatty residue can linger. This can lead to a condition called atherosclerosis that can block the flow of blood to the heart or brain, leading to a potential heart attack or stroke.

How does physical activity affect heart health in people with type 2 diabetes?
Researchers followed 1,229 people from 2001 to 2012 during th Look AHEAD trial and found that for people with type 2 diabetes who were also obese or overweight could reduce the risk of �adverse cardiovascular outcomes� if they maintained a high level of physical activity combined with consistent weight-loss regimes.

Dr. Matthew O�Brien, associate professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the co-director of the Northwestern Primary Care Practice-Based Research Program, told Healthline that the previous Look AHEAD study had not found significantly lowered cardiovascular risks with just dietary or medical adjustments and resulting weight loss.

�The current study examined whether those who achieved both weight loss and longitudinal physical activity had a lower risk of acute cardiovascular events,� O�Brien said �Indeed, the study found that those who lost weight and achieved a high level of physical activity were less likely to develop acute cardiovascular events than their counterparts who didn�t lose weight or get significant physical activity. Weight loss alone or physical activity alone did not result in a lower risk of these events � that risk was only reduced among those who both lost weight and engaged in significant physical activity.�

O�Brien was not involved in the study.

Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, who was not involved in the study, told Healthline that the combination of weight loss and physical activity may have a �synergistic� effect to protect the heart.

�The positive benefits of combining weight loss with exercise are likely multifactorial,� Chen said. �This study previously reported on results that weight loss alone or increased physical activity alone were not [sufficient] to derive a cardiovascular benefit. It appears that there is a synergistic effect in combining weight loss with exercise, possibly mediated by improved glycemic control, decreased visceral fat, and improved energy metabolism, specifically in diabetic patients.�

How to work out to protect your heart
It�s important for anyone with type 2 diabetes who is also obese or overweight to talk to a doctor about a multi-pronged approach: diet, medication, and activity.

The U.S. Surgeon General�s recommendationTrusted Source for most adults is up to 150 minutes of moderate activity per week or up to 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week. Still, O�Brien said that the presence of atherosclerosis could pose some issues with exercise, given the hindered flow of blood to or from the heart.

�If people with diabetes already have known cardiovascular disease, such as heart failure or blocked arteries in the heart, they may not be able to perform as much physical activity as those who do not have cardiovascular disease,� O�Brien said. �If walking is the main source of physical activity, we recommend walking briskly to the point where the body begins to sweat, and breathing becomes a bit more difficult.�

O�Brien said diverse types of physical activity may also be beneficial for the heart.

�It is advisable to diversify physical activity and include several forms of cardiovascular exercise that work different muscle groups,� O�Brien said. �These may include climbing stairs, jumping rope, biking, or a rowing machine. In addition, there appear to be unique metabolic benefits from resistance training with bands, free weights, or weight machines. This type of physical activity will increase muscle strength, while lowering blood sugar in adults with diabetes.�

Chen suggested that a consistent approach to activity would be beneficial.

�My recommendations for exercise for people with diabetes and obesity are the same as for everyone else: at least 15-30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking, jogging, stairs, bicycling, or swimming) most days of the week,� Chen said.

Takeaway
A new study suggests that physical activity consistently combined with a target weight-loss approach reduced the risk of cardiovascular danger significantly for people with type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes poses significant risks to cardiovascular health.

It�s recommended that any physical activity be enough to sweat or breathe hard, and be done for at least 150 minutes per week."
Health,14,"Red Light Therapy Lowers Blood Sugar by Nearly 30%, May Help Treat Diabetes",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/red-light-therapy-lowers-blood-sugar-may-help-treat-diabetes,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/female-red-light-therapy-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,26-02-24,Researchers say that just 15 minutes of red light therapy could help reduce blood sugar levels by almost 30%.,Type 2 Diabetes: Red Light Therapy May Help Lower Blood Sugar,"New research shows that red light therapy reduces blood sugar by almost 30% in healthy adults.
The researchers found that just 15 minutes of exposure to bare skin was enough to elicit benefits.
It�s too early to determine whether red light therapy could be used in diabetes treatment, but the results are promising.
Researchers in the United Kingdom have investigated the effects of red light on blood sugar levels.

Their findings, published February 20 in the Journal of BiophotonicsTrusted Source, could lay the groundwork for new therapy options for type 2 diabetes (T2D).

The scientists found that utilizing a specific wavelength of red light for just 15 minutes on bare skin affected blood sugar in two beneficial ways.

�A single dose of 670 nm red light in a healthy person can reduce blood glucose and the way it peaks after a standard blood glucose tolerance test,� Dr. Michael Powner, PhD, a senior lecturer in Neurobiology at the University of London, and first author of the research, told Healthline.

Researchers have previously investigated the effects of light therapy on other diseases, including cancerTrusted Source and macular degenerationTrusted Source.

It�s not clear yet how these new findings could be used as a safe and effective adjunct treatment for people with diabetes. However, the implications are promising, given the positive effects of red light therapy on blood glucose.

The potential for such a therapy for diabetes is intriguing as it could be delivered without drugs or surgery simply by applying red light to the skin for a prescribed amount of time.

Red light therapy reduces blood glucose levels
For their study, researchers recruited 30 healthy participants with an average age of 40 years old.

Half of them were assigned to the light therapy group, while the other half were assigned to a placebo group. Participants had no known metabolic conditions and were not taking any medication.

BMI (body mass index), which is an important risk factor for metabolic disease, was not recorded for the participants.

Over a 7-day period, both groups underwent two fasting oral glucose tolerance tests � a standard test that doctors use to identify how well the body processes sugar. It is frequently used to diagnose diabetes.

For the test, participants had to fast for at least 10 hours and then ingest a drink with a predetermined amount of glucose (sugar) in it. Following ingestion, participants had their blood sugar measured every 15 minutes for 2 hours. These measurements created a baseline reading for participants� blood sugar.

Within 7 days, another blood glucose test was administered. This time, participants received either light therapy or a placebo. Participants applied the red light to bare skin on the upper back for 15 minutes. This was done 45 minutes prior to the blood glucose test being administered. The placebo group was put through the exact same scenario, except the light was never turned on.

Researchers then compared the comprehensive results of the oral glucose tolerance tests between the red light and placebo groups, as well as comparing individuals within each group.

Compared with the baseline reading, the group that received the light therapy had a nearly 30 percent (27.7%) drop in blood glucose levels averaged over 2 hours. Compared to the placebo group, the light therapy group had a 7.3% reduction in the total blood glucose levels observed over time.

Using red light also appeared beneficial in mitigating blood sugar spikes after ingesting glucose. Blood sugar spikes can happen after eating when glucose levels rise sharply in the bloodstream.

In their experiment, researchers found that individuals who received the red light therapy had sugar spikes that were less extreme, resulting in a 7.5% reduction in their peak (highest) blood glucose level.

Compared to the placebo group, the light therapy group had a 12.1% reduction in peak blood glucose levels.

Dr. Jennifer Cheng, section chief of endocrinology at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, spoke to Medical News Today about the study and said additional research should be done to see if the results can be replicated on a larger scale.

�It will be interesting to see if this is replicated and if a certain amount of sunlight is needed to help maintain glycemic control. We always encourage our patients to go outside and exercise. This is another reason to encourage outdoor activities, but it remains to be seen if the studies can be verified,� Cheng told MNT.

How does red light therapy work?
There are different forms of light therapy that depend on the wavelength of the light being used.

The wave length can also affect the color and visibility of the light. In this experiment, and in other similar studies, the light used is a 670 nm red light, that is, a light with a wavelength of 670 nanometers.

This form of red light is known to affect cellularTrusted Source metabolism, which in turn affects blood glucose via the mitochondriaTrusted Source, but the exact mechanisms are still not entirely understood.

Mitochondria are the cell�s powerhouse, using oxygen and glucose to produce ATP, the energy for the biochemical functions essential to life. The prevalent belief is that exposing mitochondria to 670 nm red light causes an increase in the production of ATP and, therefore, a greater demand for glucose.

�The exact mechanism remains unknown. Previous studies report that red light increases energy by burning glucose in mitochondria. So, perhaps increasing mitochondrial activity decreases glucose by drawing it out from blood,� said Powner.

Other forms of light therapy work in different ways and include blue light therapy, which is used for topical skin problems like acne.

Light therapy, which requires a high intensity light box, is used for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and depression. Ultraviolet lightTrusted Source can also be used to disinfect, sanitize, and kill microorganisms.

The bottom line
Researchers found that exposing healthy people to a specific wavelength of red light prior to consuming a sugar drink resulted in a nearly 30% drop in blood sugar compared to a baseline reading.

The red light also helped to control blood sugar spikes, resulting in a 7.5% reduction in peak blood glucose.

While it is intriguing to think of the applications for red light therapy as a diabetes treatment, the researchers say it is too early to tell if it would be safe and effective."
Health,15,Finasteride Hair Loss Drug May Also Help Lower Cholesterol,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/finasteride-lower-cholesterol,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/male-mirror-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,23-02-24,"Finasteride, a common drug used to treat hair loss and enlarged prostate, may also help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease�",Heart Disease: Hair Loss Drug May Lower Cholesterol Levels,"A new study has found that finasteride may be able to reduce cholesterol levels.
The drug is currently used for male pattern baldness and enlarged prostate.
Men taking the drug had lower cholesterol levels than those who didn�t.
Mice given finasteride had reduced cholesterol levels as well.
However, more research is needed to see if it is safe and effective.
The drug finasteride, available under the brand names Proscar and Propecia, is currently used for male pattern baldness and enlarged prostate in men.

Finasteride works by stopping testosterone from being converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This slows down hair loss and prevents the prostate from growing too large.

However, a study published in the March 2024 issue of the Journal of Lipid Research suggests that there might be yet another application for this medication: lowering artery-clogging cholesterol.

In addition to being associated with lower cholesterol levels in men, the drug was also found to reduce cholesterol, delay atherosclerosis, and lower liver inflammation in mice.

Studying how finasteride affects cholesterol
The idea for the study first came about when the lead author, Jaume Amengual, PhD, became curious to learn about the long-term effects of finasteride.

After examining data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that was collected between 2009 and 2016, Amengual found, on average, that the men who were taking the drug had cholesterol that was about 30 points lower than those men who weren�t taking it.

Unfortunately, there was nothing in the data to tell him what dose the men had been taking or for how long. This led him to set up a study with mice.

In this study, mice were treated with four different amounts of finasteride: 0, 10, 100, and 1,000 milligrams per kilogram of food. The drug was given to mice that were genetically prone to developing atherosclerosis.

Additionally, the animals were fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet mimicking a typical Western diet consumed by humans.

After 12 weeks, the mice had their lipids tested and were examined for evidence of atherosclerosis. They were also tested for gene expression in the liver.

The researchers additionally looked at bile acid metabolism and tested the mice for steroids, triglycerides, and immune activity.

After performing the tests, they found that the mice that were given finasteride had lower cholesterol levels, both in their plasma and in their arteries.

They also had lower lipid levels and inflammatory markers.

Amengual did note in a press release that the amount needed to achieve this result was �incredibly high.� However, he explained, mice tend to be more resistant to drugs than humans are. This, combined with the fact that men in the NHANES database also saw reduced cholesterol levels, suggests that humans would respond to a lower dose than the mice did.

Why finasteride might lower cholesterol
Rigved Tadwalkar, MD � a board certified consultant cardiologist at Providence Saint John�s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, who was not involved in the study � stated that there are a few potential ways that finasteride might benefit human cholesterol levels.

�One proposed mechanism suggests that finasteride could reduce monocyte activity and inflammation, thereby diminishing the number of monocytes, which are immune cells that are involved in the formation of arterial plaques,� he explained.

�Another avenue explored is the modulation of bile acid metabolism by finasteride, hinting at its potential to influence the production and excretion of bile acids, consequently impacting cholesterol metabolism.�

Tadwalkar additionally noted that the study delved into the possibility that finasteride changes hepatic gene expression.

These alterations might be able to extend to lipid metabolism and inflammation in the liver, he said.

Limitations in the study
Justin Manjourides, PhD � a biostatistician and Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Northeastern University who was not a part of the research � commented on the study, saying, �My initial thoughts are that this is a fairly well-done study.�

Although the key results are in mice, they are consistent with what was observed in humans, he pointed out.

�By motivating the observational portion of the study on the experimental mouse data, the authors sidestep the common �p-hacking� critique where several exposure-outcome pairs are examined and only those reaching significance are presented.�

Further, reduced cholesterol levels were consistent across several potential effect modifiers, said Manjourides.

He went on to note that the NHANES portion of the study had several limitations, including the fact that it only included 155 men.

�With respect to finasteride, there are no measures of dosage, adherence, or duration of treatment,� he added.

�In a cross-sectional study, lacking information on duration of treatment or information on baseline outcome measures (pre-finasteride exposure) hinders our ability to establish a causal relationship between the exposure and outcome.�

Manjourides also remarked that there are potential issues with the underlying differences between those who used finasteride and those who didn�t.

�There is no way to tell in which direction a bias caused by lacking this information would be,� he concluded.

How finasteride compares with other cholesterol drugs
While these findings are promising, Tadwalkar said it�s too early to say how well finasteride might compare with other established cholesterol-lowering medications, such as statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors.

These drugs have proven efficacy in lowering cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular risk, he said.

�While the study suggests a potential benefit of finasteride in delaying cardiovascular disease by improving the plasma lipid profile, the benefits should be considered in the context of existing interventions,� said Tadwalkar.

�More research is needed to determine its true efficacy, safety profile, and optimal role in managing cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk.�

Takeaway
New research suggests that the drug finasteride, currently used to treat male pattern baldness and enlarged prostate, might also be able to reduce cholesterol, thereby reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease.

Men using the drug had lower cholesterol levels.

Finasteride was also found to reduce cholesterol levels in mice.

However, while the findings of the study are promising, it�s too soon to say how well it might compare with existing therapies. More research is needed to show whether finasteride is safe and effective for reducing cholesterol in humans.

These habits include not smoking, vigorous physical activity, and getting enough quality sleep.
Experts said that not smoking may reduce inflammation, exercise can regulate bowel movements and sleep can boost immune function � all of which contribute to a healthy gut and minimizing IBS symptoms.
To treat IBS, avoid spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol. Also, exercise regularly, don�t smoke and practice good sleep hygiene.
Following healthy lifestyle habits is associated with a reduced risk of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), according to a new study. These habits included not smoking, vigorous physical activity, and getting enough quality sleep.

The findings were published February 20 in the journal Gut.

Researchers examined five key healthy behaviors, which include never smoking, getting at least 7 hours of quality sleep each night; a high level of vigorous physical activity each week; a high-quality balanced diet every day; and moderate alcohol intake.

They analyzed participants of an average age of 55 from the UK Biobank, which included 64,268 people, just over half of whom (55%) were women, and who had completed at least two 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires. The period of examination took place during a 12.6-year period, during which 961 (1.5%) cases of IBS were recorded.

Results showed 7,604 (12%) of participants didn�t engage in any of the 5 healthy lifestyle behaviors, while 20,662 (32%) reported one; 21,901 (34%) reported two; and 14,101 (22%) reported three to five behaviors at the start of the study.

According to the results of this study, individuals who adopt an increasing number of these healthy lifestyle behaviors could see a proportional decrease in their IBS risk, with adherence to one, two, or three to five behaviors associated with reductions of 21%, 36%, and 42% in IBS risk, respectively.

Furthermore, three healthy behaviors were independently linked with a lower risk of IBS: never smoking (14% lower); high level of physical activity (17% lower); and a good night�s sleep (27% lower).

What causes IBS?
Although the exact causes of IBS are not fully understood several factors appear to contribute to its development. Dr. Anthony Lembo, a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic who specializes in gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition, provided a list:

Increased sensitivity to pain or discomfort in the intestines.
Altered gut microbiota: imbalances in the types and amounts of bacteria in the gut may play a role.
Immune dysregulation: low-grade inflammation in the intestines or dysfunction in the immune system
Food intolerances or sensitivities: certain foods or food components may trigger symptoms in individuals with IBS.
Psychological factors: stress, anxiety, or depression can exacerbate symptoms or contribute to their onset.
Abnormal gastrointestinal motility: irregular contractions of the muscles in the intestines can lead to symptoms like diarrhea or constipation
It is important to note that IBS is a very broad term.

�It is broad because it groups a bunch of different GI issues together because they all lead to the same symptoms (irregular bowel habits and abdominal discomfort, basically),� said Dr. Aditya Sreenivasan, gastroenterologist at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital. �But it can be caused by a variety of different GI issues. It can be caused by hormonal irregularities leading to fluid shifts and irregularities in intestinal motion, bacterial imbalance in the colon and/or small intestine, or hypersensitive nerves in the GI tract. There are probably multiple other causes that are not well understood as well.�

How lifestyle factors influence IBS
Results of the study showed not smoking, a high level of vigorous physical activity, and getting enough quality sleep were linked with managing IBS symptoms.

According to Lembo, the connection likely lies in their effects on various factors such as:

Quitting smoking may reduce inflammation in the gut and improve overall gastrointestinal health.
Regular exercise can help regulate bowel movements, increase GI motility, reduce stress levels, and improve overall gut function, potentially reducing the severity of IBS symptoms.
Poor sleep quality or insufficient sleep can negatively impact gut health, immune function, and stress levels.
It is important to note the multifactorial nature of IBS includes various biological, psychosocial, and environmental factors.

�Lifestyle modifications, such as not smoking, engaging in regular physical activity, and maintaining healthy sleep habits, are key components in the management of IBS,� said Lembo. �The study highlighted suggests that healthy lifestyle choices could potentially reduce the risk of developing IBS. We use these same lifestyle modifications to manage symptoms in those with IBS.�

�These things each play a major role in influencing various factors that can increase or decrease IBS symptoms,� Sreenivasan stated. �Smoking leads to generalized inflammation and also leads to a lot of swallowed air, both of which can separately exacerbate or cause various IBS symptoms.�

Sreenivasan added: �Lack of exercise leads to slow intestinal motility, and likely leads to increases in stress hormone levels. Similarly with not sleeping � lack of sleep interferes with your brain�s ability to regulate the signals it is getting from your visceral (or intestinal) nerves.�

So, if your brain usually blocks out the signals from your gut that are activated by fluid shifts, intestinal contractions, or gas, your sleep-deprived brain lets all of those signals in and perceives it as discomfort or pain, Sreenivasan explained.

How to improve IBS symptoms
Treatment for IBS typically focuses on managing symptoms and improving overall quality of life. This may include a combination of dietary changes, lifestyle modifications, medications, and psychological interventions, Lembo stated.

Some common approaches to treating IBS include:

Dietary modifications: Avoiding trigger foods that exacerbate symptoms, such as certain types of carbohydrates (FODMAPs), caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. Increasing fiber intake or trying a low FODMAP diet under the guidance of a healthcare professional may also help alleviate symptoms.
Lifestyle changes: not smoking, exercising, getting enough sleep
Medications: Over-the-counter or prescription medications may be used to manage specific symptoms of IBS, such as antispasmodics for abdominal pain, laxatives for constipation, or anti-diarrheal medications for diarrhea. Probiotics may also be recommended to help restore gut microbiota balance.
Psychological interventions: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy, or mindfulness-based stress reduction
IBS treatment should be individualized, ideally with a multidisciplinary team.

Takeaway
A new study shows practicing healthy lifestyle habits (not smoking, vigorous physical activity, and getting enough quality sleep) can lead to a lower risk of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

The reason why these habits may be beneficial for a healthy gut: smoking may reduce inflammation, exercise can regulate bowel movements and sleep can strengthen immune function.

To manage IBS symptoms, avoid spicy foods, caffeine and alcohol. Additionally, exercise regularly, don�t smoke and practice good sleep hygiene."
Health,17,Eating a Plant-Based Diet May Help Reduce Snoring,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/plant-based-diet-reduce-snoring,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bowl-vegetables-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,23-02-24,New research suggests that people who eat a plant-based diet may have a lower risk of experiencing sleep apnea and snoring. Here�s why.,Why You May Snore Less If You Eat a Plant-Based Diet,"Eating healthy plant-based food may reduce instances of dangerous snoring, according to new research.
However, people who ate an unhealthy plant-based diet were shown to have an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea.
Experts say healthy foods may lower your risk of snoring and sleep apnea by reducing inflammation and helping you keep a healthy weight.
To counteract snoring, you should incorporate nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory foods into your diet
According to new research, adopting a healthy plant-based diet may be an effective way to stop snoring.

A study published this week in ERJ Open Research found people who eat a healthy, plant-based diet that is high in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and nuts are less likely to experience obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).

People with sleep apnea often snore loudly and are frequently awakened throughout the night due to interruptions in their breathing.

In addition to fatigue, sleep apnea can increase the following health risks:

high blood pressure
stroke
heart disease
type 2 diabetes
In the study, people with diets highest in plant-based food were 19% less likely to experience OSA compared with those eating diets lowest in plant-based food. Those eating a largely vegetarian diet were also at a lower risk.

While making healthy plant-based choices appears to reduce instances of snoring, it seems food quality is key.

The study also found that people eating an unhealthy plant-based diet, high in refined carbohydrates, sugary drinks, high-sugar and high-salt foods, are at a higher risk of OSA.

In fact, people eating a diet high in unhealthy plant-based foods were at a 22% higher risk compared to those eating low amounts of these foods.

Snoring and a plant-based diet: what�s the link?
Is eating plant-based a must if you want to reduce your risk of snoring?

Dan Gartenberg, PhD, sleep scientist and the founder and CEO of SleepSpace, who was not involved in the study,isn�t entirely convinced.

�These findings align with existing knowledge about the health benefits of plant-based diets, but they do not tell us whether a healthy meat-based diet would be inferior to a healthy plant-based diet when it comes to obstructive sleep apnea,� he points out.

One reason a plant-based diet, rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and nuts, may positively affect sleep apnea is because of its impact on inflammation.

�These foods are abundant in nutrients, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory compounds, which can help reduce inflammation, neutralize damage-causing free radicals, and ultimately decrease oxidative stress in the body,� Gartenberg explains.

In contrast, an unhealthy plant-based diet high in refined carbohydrates, sugary drinks, and high-sugar and high-salt foods can cause inflammation in the throat.

High-sugar and high-salt diets, in particular, can also disrupt the fluid balance in the body.

Gartenberg says this can lead to swelling in many parts of the body, including the head and neck, which may increase the likelihood of airway obstruction during sleep, worsened snoring, and breathing difficulties.

Additionally, making healthier food choices can counteract one of sleep apnea�s biggest risk factors: obesity.

�A plant-based diet addresses the risks of inflammation and obesity by promoting a healthy weight and reducing inflammation in the upper airway,� says Gartenberg. �As a result, these healthy foods can reduce some of the factors that contribute to airway obstruction, thereby making it easier to breathe during sleep.�

Another possible factor to consider is acid reflux, which has been linked to sleep apnea severity.

�Certain foods can leave you prone to or even worsen existing cases of acid reflux,� Gartenberg notes.

However, he points out that researchTrusted Source suggests that people who eat a plant-based diet are less likely to experience chronic reflux issues, such as GERD.

Given this information, he says it�s possible that a healthy plant-based diet could theoretically reduce your risk of reflux-related sleep apnea.

Dietary changes that may help reduce snoring
Still, it�s important to remember that the findings of this study do not necessarily indicate that a healthy meat-based diet would not have a similar impact on OSA. Gartenberg says more research is needed to answer that question.

What�s clear, though, is that making healthier choices seems to have a positive effect � and that could pay dividends for your overall health and well-being.

�Snoring isn�t just noisy and annoying for your partner; it can mess with your health,� points out Dr. Shelby Harris, director of sleep health at Sleepopolis, who was not involved in the study. �It can lead to poor or fragmented sleep, an increased risk of developing cardiovascular issues, daytime fatigue, weight gain, and hormonal imbalances.�

So, where should you start if you are interested in tweaking your diet to counteract snoring?

�Focus on adjusting your diet to include foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and lean proteins,� Harris advises.

�It�s also important to stay hydrated and lead a healthy, active lifestyle,� she adds.

Gartenberg shares similar advice.

�Focus on incorporating nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory foods into their diet. This includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes,� he says.

�The timing of meals also plays a role. Try not to consume large meals within two hours of going to bed. This advice is especially important when consuming fatty or sugary foods,� he adds.

As your sleep improves and you feel better rested, you might find it easier to make healthier food choices.

�This is because poor sleep quality due to snoring may influence dietary choices, leading to cravings for high calorie, sugary foods and decreased motivation for physical activity � all of which can further exacerbate obesity and obstructive sleep apnea,� Gartenberg points out.

Snoring treatment alternatives
Diet isn�t the only way to help reduce snoring.

�Some other tips for trying to reduce your snoring can be sleeping on your side, using nasal strips, addressing any allergens (dust, etc.) in your sleeping environment, and avoiding smoking,� says Harris.

Ultimately though, she says if snoring is chronic and disturbing your sleep, talk with your doctor to rule out any underlying health issues.

Takeaway
Obstructive sleep apnea isn�t just disruptive; it can pose serious health risks.

The results of this study suggest that making healthier food choices may help prevent it.

However, the jury�s out on whether you need to exclusively eat plant-based foods to experience the benefits."
Health,18,Fasting-Like Diet Reduced Prediabetes Markers and Signs of Aging by 2. 5 Years,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/fasting-like-diet-reduced-prediabetes-markers-and-signs-of-aging-by-2-5-years,https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/older-female-drinking-water-kitchen-1296x728-header-1296x729.jpg,23-02-24,Researchers studied the effects of a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) for three to four months in two clinical trial groups. The FMD involves eating a�,Fasting-Like Diet May Reduce Signs of Aging by 2.5 Years,"Five-day cycles each month of a fasting-like diet improved markers of prediabetes and reduced fat in the liver.
People following this fasting-mimicking diet also showed signs of reduced immune system aging and biological age.
The diet involves eating a lower-calorie, higher-fat diet five days in a row each month, with people following their normal diet the rest of the time.
Monthly cycles of a diet that mimics fasting can improve insulin resistance and other markers of prediabetes, and reduce fat in the liver, a new study shows. Researchers say this diet also reduced signs of immune system aging and biological age.

The fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) involves five-day cycles of a diet low in overall calories, protein and carbohydrates; and high in unsaturated fats, such as the kind found in olive oil, nuts and seeds.

The diet was developed by study author Valter Longo, PhD, a professor at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology in Los Angeles.

�This is the first study to show that a food-based intervention that does not require chronic dietary or other lifestyle changes can make people biologically younger, based on both changes in risk factors for aging and disease and on a validated method developed by the [Morgan E. Levine] group to assess biological age,� Longo said in a news release.

The new study was published Feb. 20 in Nature CommunicationTrusted Source. Previous research led by Longo has also found that the FMD can lower risk factorsTrusted Source for cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in people.

What is the fasting-mimicking diet?
The FMD is a primarily plant-based diet designed to produce fasting-like effects on blood levels of glucose, ketone bodies and other molecules, while still providing calories and nutrients and making it potentially safer and easier to complete compared to conventional fasting.

Day one of the FMD provides around 1,100 calories, with 11% coming from protein, 46% fat and 43% carbohydrates. Days two to five provide around 720 calories per day, with 9% protein, 44% fat and 47% carbohydrates.

On average, adult females need 1,800 to 2,400 calories a dayTrusted Source to maintain weight, while adult males need 2,400 to 3,000 calories a day. This varies based on activity level and other factors.

Fasting-mimicking diet may be easier to maintain
Research has shown that eating 15% to 20% fewer calories per day � known as calorie restriction � can improve risk factors for diabetesTrusted Source and cardiovascular disease in people.

However, doing this every day for months or years is challenging.

One advantage of the FMD is that it is done five days in a row during the month, with people eating a normal diet for the rest of the month. In the new study, participants did three to four cycles of the FMD.

In the study, researchers provided participants with all the food they needed, with the food for each day individually boxed to avoid people eating meals and snacks on the wrong day.

The food boxes included vegetable-based soups, energy bars, energy drinks, chip snacks, tea and a supplement that provided minerals, vitamins and essential fatty acids.

Longo is the founder of ProLon, the company that provided food for the study.

The FMD is not the only fasting-light option out there. Versions of intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating also provide some of the benefits of extended fasting, without requiring a complete change to someone�s eating habits.

Research on these types of eating patterns is ongoing, with some studies showing strong benefits and others showing fewer or none.

Can you really de-age yourself by fasting?
In the new study, researchers analyzed blood samples from participants from two previously conducted clinical trial populations, aiming to uncover new insights. Participants who were randomized to the FMD in each trial practiced the FMD for five days each month, followed by their normal diet for 25 days.

After 3 months, people on the FMD diet had fewer risk factors for diabetes, including less insulin resistance and lower HbA1c levels, researchers found. HbA1c is a measure of long-term blood glucose control.

�Although the number of examined study participants is small, taken together with our previous study, these results indicate that the FMD can reduce insulin resistance and help restore normal glucose tolerance in individuals that had fasting glucose levels indicative of pre-diabetes,� the authors wrote.

People following the FMD also had a decrease in abdominal fat and fat within the liver, as measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both of these are linked to a lower risk of metabolic syndrome.

Metabolic syndrome is a group of five risk factors that, if untreated, increase the chance of developing heart disease, diabetes and stroke.

�These [measures] are things that we use as parameters of people�s overall health,� said Dr. David Cutler, family medicine physician at Providence Saint John�s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif.

In addition, researchers found that people in the FMD group had signs of a more youthful immune system, and a reduced biological age, as indicated by how well the cells and tissues are functioning.

The measureTrusted Source of biological age researchers used in this study was based on a number of markers for functioning of the metabolism, heart and circulation, lungs, liver, immune system and inflammation, and blood cells.

Based on this, most participants in the study had biological ages younger than their chronological ages, which suggests they �may be healthier than the average American,� the authors wrote.

After three cycles of the FMD, the average biological age of participants had decreased by nearly 2.5 years, the findings showed.

Limitations of the new study
The study had several limitations, including the small number of participants, with only 86 people following the FMD in total between the two clinical trials studied.

As a result, �you have to be very careful about drawing any kind of long-term conclusions based on a study of 86 people,� Cutler told Healthline.

�We�ve seen this many times before,� he said, �where you take a small population and you see very dramatic results. But when you try to apply it to the broader population, those results disappear.�

Another limitation is that people in the study generally had more �advantageous� social, economic, behavioral and health characteristics, the researchers pointed out, so the results may not apply to other groups of people.

Longer-term studies with larger numbers of people are needed, including studies that directly compare the FMD to other dietary interventions such as other types of fasting or diets such as the Mediterranean diet.

In addition, long-term studies are needed to understand whether the immediate benefits seen in the new study translate to a lower risk of heart attack, stroke, functioning, dying early, or other outcomes.

And whether the benefits � including the apparent decrease in biological age � continue to accumulate after years of following the FMD, or if there�s a plateauing.

Cutler, who often advises patients to eat mostly vegetables and eat less overall, questions whether the effort put into the FMD is worth the benefits seen in the study.

�How much do you want to devote � in terms of time, money and sacrificing things you like � to achieve these ends?� he said.

�I�m not saying don�t do it. I�m just saying, you have to temper your enthusiasm for something when you�re not really certain if it�s going to have significant long-term beneficial effects,� he added.

Takeaway
Researchers studied the effects of a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) for three to four months in two clinical trial groups. The FMD involves eating a lower-calorie, higher-fat diet for five days in a row each month.

Those following the FMD had improved markers of prediabetes, lower abdominal and liver fat, and signs of reduced immune system and biological aging.

Longer-term studies are needed to know if these benefits continue to accumulate or if they plateau, and if they lead to reductions in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dying early or other outcomes."

The telehealth yoga program significantly reduced low�,Low Back Pain? These Yoga Poses May Offer Some Relief,"New research builds on existing evidence supporting the benefits of yoga for low back pain.
A 4-week telehealth yoga program significantly reduced low back pain among participants with the condition.
The researchers found certain yoga poses emphasizing hip flexion improved the flexion-relaxation ratio, a biomarker of chronic lower back pain.
Larger studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of yoga on low back pain relief.
While yoga is not a cure-all, there is no shortage of science-backed benefits of the practice.

Yoga is frequently studied for its potential to relieve chronic low back pain, an often difficult-to-treat condition that in 2020 affected 619 million people globallyTrusted Source.

Now, an Italian research team specializing in rehabilitative medicine has furthered our understanding of yoga�s positive impact on low back pain.

The researchers evaluated the effects of a 4-week yoga program on the flexion-relaxation phenomenon, a biomarker of chronic low back pain limiting paraspinal muscle activity or range of motion.

They recruited 10 females ages 18�40 with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NCLBP) and 11 females without. Both groups participated in a structured 8-session yoga program; the first session was conducted in a clinic, and the remaining sessions were offered via telehealth. The 30-minute sessions included a sequence of nearly 30 yoga postures (asanas), breathwork, and other mindfulness practices.

The findings, published February 21 in theJournal of Orthopaedic ResearchTrusted Source, show a significant reduction in pain intensity in the back pain group. Yoga also benefitted neuromuscular response during spinal flexion in both groups, thus improving participants� flexion-relaxation ratio.

Due to the small number of participants and short study duration, the researchers note that further studies are needed to determine any long?term effects of yoga on low back pain.

�Relieving back pain still remains a challenge, [and] asanas can become an addition to the range of possibilities in managing this disorder,� Dr. Alessandro de Sire, associate professor of physical and rehabilitative medicine at the University of Catanzaro Magna Graecia and physician at University Hospital Renato Dulbecco in Italy, told Healthline.

Yoga reduces back pain, improves mobility
The study builds on existing evidence supporting the benefits of yoga for low back pain relief.

Researchers observed a reduction in pain intensity after 4 weeks using a 10-point visual analog scale (6.8 average pain at the start of the study, 3.3 after the yoga sessions).

Yoga also improved participants� flexion�relaxation phenomenon (5.12 at the start of the study, 9.49 after the sessions), which was measured with electromyography during maximum voluntary flexion (rounding) of the spine.

Given the short-term nature of the study, researchers used a Prophet evaluation to predict positive flexion-relaxation trends for an additional month after the intervention. The evaluation forecasts that tele-yoga asana could continue to positively affect pain intensity and spinal mobility.

The yoga postures included in the study varied, but many involved some type of hip flexion (forward bend) with a neutral spine.

�I appreciate that this study explored the ways that asana can relax muscles, and it echoes what yoga traditionally tells us, which is that forward bending poses are generally calming and relaxing,� Jivana Heyman, a yoga therapist in Santa Barbara, CA, founder of Accessible Yoga and author of Yoga Revolution, told Healthline.

�Hip flexion can be very beneficial for people with low back pain because it can increase range of motion without overly engaging the lower back. My sense is that people with chronic low back pain hold additional tension in that area as a protective mechanism, and asana can help to release some of that tension,� Heyman said.

Yoga poses for chronic low back pain
There are countless studies about yoga, but they don�t always disclose which poses were used to achieve the desired outcome.

Rather than study a particular style of yoga (i.e., Hatha or Vinyasa), the researchers included a regimen of nearly 30 postures to demonstrate how yoga works to relieve low back pain more clearly.

De Sire said each pose in the sequence was held for five breaths (around 1 minute each) for a total of 30 minutes per session.

�Asanas can commonly be difficult and misleading to assimilate; providing the reader with specific postures might guarantee scientific reproducibility, but above all greater dissemination of the practice with scientific evidence,� de Sire explained.

Heyman said he appreciated the inclusion of the poses in the study.

�Often doctors refer patients with low back pain to yoga, and the patients are left to figure out what practices or classes are appropriate for them,� he said. �They could easily end up in a yoga class that is too physically intense, which could cause more injury or simply leave them feeling that yoga is not for them.�

The following yoga poses for low back pain were included in the study:

Easy Seat (Sukhasana)
Cat Stretch (Marjariasana)
Mountain Pose (Tadasana)
Crescent Lunge (Ashta Chandrasana)
Cow Pose (Bitilasana)
Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)
Pyramid Pose (Parsvottanasana)
Pigeon Pose (Eka pada rajakapotasana)
Half Lift (Ardha Uttanasana)
Chair Pose (Utkatasana)
Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana)
Crocodile Pose (Makarasana)
Child�s Pose (Balasana)
Standing Foward Bend (Uttanasana)
Half Lord of the Fishes Pose (Ardha Matsyendrasana)
Staff Pose (Dandasana)
Gate Pose (Parighasana)
Head-to-Knee Forward Bend (Janu Sirsasana)
Cobbler�s Pose (Baddha Konasana)
Caterpillar Pose (Ardha Paschimottanasana)
Eye of the Needle Pose (Sucirandhrasana)
Belly Twist Pose (Supta Jathara Parivartanasana)
Happy Baby (Apanasana)
Legs Up the Wall Pose (Viparita Karani)
Plow Pose (Halasana)
Bridge Pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana)
Corpse Pose (Savasana)
A promising intervention for low back pain relief
The study�s model predicts the positive results of yoga for back pain could be maintained long-term, de Sire explained, but larger, more rigorous studies are needed to determine this effect.

Still, Heyman said that yoga can be a helpful intervention for finding relief from low back pain.

�This study adds to the growing literature that supports yoga as a viable treatment for low back pain, which is a major cause of disability and lost work in the U.S. and around the world,� he said.

�I have found that my students with low back pain gain even more benefit from the yoga practices that help regulate their nervous systems and reduce tension and stress. So building a well-rounded yoga practice that focuses not just on asana but on stress reduction and nervous system regulation could offer even greater benefit to people with low back pain,� he added.

Tips to get started with yoga if you have low back pain
If you live with low back pain and are interested in trying yoga, it�s a good idea to do some research to find appropriate classes and qualified instructors.

�If you�re looking to start yoga and you have low back pain, I�d recommend that you look for yoga therapists (C-IAYT) or classes with titles such as �Accessible Yoga,� �Adaptive Yoga,� and �Gentle Yoga,� Heyman shared, adding that chair yoga can also be a great place for beginners.

�Be careful about jumping into classes with titles like �All Levels� or flow classes where there are quick movements,� he noted.

Heyman said the most important component of any yoga class is clarity of instruction and the teacher�s ability to individualize the practice to meet the practitioner�s needs.

�Talk to the teacher before class starts to let them know about your condition so they can adapt the practices for you,� he said, emphasizing yoga props as a helpful tool for finding comfortable variations within poses.

�People with low back pain tend to be very aware of what movements feel safe, and it�s important to support them in exploring these poses in a safe and accessible way,� Heyman said.

Takeaway
A new study helps further our understanding of the benefits of yoga for low back pain relief.

The 4-week, 8-session telehealth yoga program significantly reduced low back pain among subjects with the condition. Yoga postures involving hip flexion appear to improve the flexion-relaxation phenomenon, a biomarker of low back pain.

Larger studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of yoga on low back pain relief."

*Published 4 days ago*

A Lincolnshire village is home to one of the world's largest collections of vintage TV and film equipment. Enthusiasts at the Broadcast Engineering Conservation Group are working to save historical cameras and outside broadcast vehicles. A collection of hundreds of items is housed in a building at the former RAF Hemswell base near Gainsborough. The charity's equipment has been used in period dramas, such as Netflix series *The Crown*. Dr. Paul Marshall, chair of the organization, said the museum aims to preserve the analog technology and its production techniques. ""The skills are dying out,"" he said. ""One of the things that we're keen to do here is impart this knowledge to the next generation."" The museum relies on volunteers and donations to keep going. Restoration projects include a number of outside broadcast vans used by the BBC and ITV.

One of the star items in the collection is a TV camera used to broadcast the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. After spending around 25 years in a rubbish tip, it has been cosmetically restored. ""It's been seen in many [film and TV] productions,"" Dr. Marshall said. ""One of them was in *The Crown* where it played itself, as it were: one of the cameras in their recreation of the coronation."""

That will leave FD Technologies owning the KX software business, which has been its major strategic focus in recent years.

The aim has been to grow subscription sales of KX products, which has involved significantly increasing sales and marketing spending.

However the firm says it has seen lower than expected annual recurring revenue growth in this part of the business for a number of reasons.

The company's chair, Donna Troy, said the break up of the group was a ""transformative action"" which would ""realise value for shareholders"".

""I am confident we can address some of the recent short-term trading issues with the actions we have announced today,"" she added.

Founded by the late Brian Conlon in 1996, the company employs about 2,800 people worldwide and is one of Northern Ireland's biggest graduate recruiters."

Technology,23,Have we lost faith in technology?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68057193,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/D9D8/production/_132186755_mr_bates_vs_the_post_office_02.jpg,09-02-24,The BBC's technology editor Zoe Kleinman looks at the technology sector's damaged reputation.,Have we lost faith in technology? - BBC News,"Relationship status: it's complicated.

When it comes to technology, never before have we been both more reliant, and more wary.

Society is more connected, but also more lonely; more productive, but also more burnt-out; we have more privacy tools, but arguably less privacy.

There's no doubt that some tech innovation has been universally great. The formula for a new antibiotic that killed a previously lethal hospital superbug was invented by an AI tool.

Machines that can suck carbon dioxide out of the air could be a huge help in the fight against climate change. Video games and movies are more immersive and entertaining because of better screens and better effects.

But on the other hand, tech-related scandals dominate headlines. Stories about data breaches, cyber attacks and horrific online abuse are regularly on the news.

In the UK, faulty accounting software that led to false convictions of fraud for hundreds of innocent Post Office workers, because of blind faith in the tech, has caused national outrage.

""Like everything, tech has a dark side. It is a two-edged sword,"" says veteran Silicon Valley watcher, Prof Mike Malone.

In other words: it's complicated.I've been having a lot of conversations lately about whether all of this is resulting in people losing faith in the powerful tech tools - both hardware and software - which have inserted themselves so dominantly into our lives, and caused so much disruption.

No more so than usual, argues Eileen Burbidge from the investment fund Passion Capital.

""I think it's quite cyclical,"" she says. ""We have talked about this over the years, in relation to data privacy, AI, robotics, privacy, social media, jobs, wellbeing...""

She may feel like a broken record, but she also thinks that it's an important conversation to keep on having.

""It helps consumers and businesses to be more conscientious about what they're adopting,"" she adds. ""It also helps regulators to think about where they should focus their attention.""

Advertising industry veteran Sir Martin Sorrell is characteristically blunt about it. ""Everybody uses tech - it would be wrong to say we are losing faith in it,"" he tells me.

But he does agree that people are increasingly fearful of its implications, particularly in relation to the impact of rapidly advancing AI tools on jobs (a recent report by the International Monetary Fund suggested that 40% of all current jobs will be affected by AI).

He gives me a stark example from his own world: ""The time it takes to produce an ad has shrunk from three weeks to three hours.""

And it's not just the loss of jobs that people fear when it comes to AI. There are legitimate concerns that powerful automated tools making important decisions about us in the future - perhaps about our healthcare, or in a judicial process - will display unintended discrimination and bias.

Then there are dilemmas about the data these tools are trained upon and who it belongs to, and at the more extreme end of things, there's the existential threat of the destruction of humanity by out-of-control machines.

Paolo Pescatore is an analyst who keeps a close eye on the tech sector. ""Fundamentally, if there was a problem people would, should, stop using it,"" he says.

But he then goes on to talk about the peer pressure to remain plugged in - from colleagues, friends and family, and even from governments wanting to switch to digital services.

And what about the tech sector itself? The big US firms have shed thousands of workers in recent months. Tesla and X owner Elon Musk is known to favour a hard-working culture, and he was among the first to summon staff back to the office after the pandemic.

The industry has become a more vulnerable place for its staff, entrepreneur Tomas Halgas tells me. ""Tech workers were very comfy in our jobs pre-Covid,"" he explains.

""People used to say, 'Google isn't a job, it's a retirement plan'. Those days are long gone.""Mr Halgas is a young tech boss with big ambition. He sold his first start-up to X when it was Twitter, and he's already successfully raised over $2m (�1.6m) for his second, an AI-driven app-builder called Sutro.

""Tech workers thought they were safe from automation: now we are among the people who might be replaced,"" he says. Replaced, that is, by code-writing AI tools rather like his own.

""A lot of people are having existential crises right now.""

Industry watchers like me have seen AI on the horizon for some time - but everyone was blown away by the dramatic impact of the launch of just one product: ChatGPT.

It's been out in the open for just over one year, and within months it was passing the bar exam taken by trainee lawyers. Sam Altman, the boss of the firm OpenAI which created it, says advances we will see in 2024 will make the current version look ""quaint"".

Is it time to slow things down a bit?

A recent survey by PR firm Edelman suggested that 52% of people in the UK (yes, that old ratio again) believed tech innovation was developing too fast, and 70% thought tech bosses should develop new tech slowly.

Realistically, there is practically zero chance of that happening. The money and power that is flooding in, particularly to the AI sector, speaks for itself.

But the outpouring of public debate that also whirls around it is healthy, argues Prof Malone.

""We're not just blindly embracing new tech anymore,"" he says. ""That's a good thing."""
Technology,24,Neuralink: Can Musk's brain technology change the world?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68169082,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/11853/production/_132536717_gettyimages-1852530283.jpg,04-02-24,"The world's richest man is betting heavily on his brain chip, but he has ground to make up.",Neuralink: Can Musk's brain technology change the world? - BBC News,"Elon Musk is no stranger to bold claims - from his plans to colonise Mars to his dreams of building transport links underneath our biggest cities. This week the world's richest man said his Neuralink division had successfully implanted its first wireless brain chip into a human.

Is he right when he says this technology could - in the long term - save the human race itself?

Sticking electrodes into brain tissue is really nothing new.

In the 1960s and 70s electrical stimulation was used to trigger or suppress aggressive behaviour in cats. By the early 2000s monkeys were being trained to move a cursor around a computer screen using just their thoughts.

""It's nothing novel, but implantable technology takes a long time to mature, and reach a stage where companies have all the pieces of the puzzle, and can really start to put them together,"" says Anne Vanhoestenberghe, professor of active implantable medical devices, at King's College London.Neuralink is one of a growing number of companies and university departments attempting to refine and ultimately commercialise this technology. The focus, at least to start with, is on paralysis and the treatment of complex neurological conditions.

The human brain is home to around 86 billion neurons, nerve cells connected to one another by synapses. Every time we want to move, feel or think, a tiny electrical impulse is generated and sent incredibly quickly from one neuron to another.

Scientists have developed devices which can detect some of those signals - either using a non-invasive cap placed on the head or wires implanted into the brain itself.

The technology - known as a brain-computer interface (BCI) - is where many millions of dollars of research funding appears to be heading at the moment.

Neuralink's device, about the size of a coin, is inserted in the skull, with microscopic wires which can read neuron activity and beam back a wireless signal to a receiving unit. The company has run trials in pigs and claimed that monkeys can play a basic version of the video game Pong.

It received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for human trials in May 2023.

We now know that the first patient has received their implant - but details are thin on the ground. Musk has only said the person is ""recovering well"" and initial results show ""promising neuron spike detection"".

It might all sound very science fiction, but in some ways Neuralink is playing catch-up.

One of its main rivals, a start-up called Synchron backed by funding from investment firms controlled by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, has already implanted its stent-like device into 10 patients.

Back in December 2021, Philip O'Keefe, a 62-year old Australian who lives with a form of motor neurone disease, composed the first tweet using just his thoughts to control a cursor.And researchers at Lausanne University in Switzerland have shown it is possible for a paralysed man to walk again by implanting multiple devices to bypass damage caused by a cycling accident.

In a research paper published this year, they demonstrated a signal could be beamed down from a device in his brain to a second device implanted at the base of his spine, which could then trigger his limbs to move.

Some people living with spinal injuries are sceptical about the sudden interest in this new kind of technology.

""These breakthroughs get announced time and time again and don't seem to be getting any further along,"" says Glyn Hayes, who was paralysed in a motorbike accident in 2017, and now runs public affairs for the Spinal Injuries Association.

""If I could have anything back, it wouldn't be the ability to walk. It would be putting more money into a way of removing nerve pain, for example, or ways to improve bowel, bladder and sexual function.""

'Species-level important'
But for Elon Musk, ""solving"" brain and spinal injuries is just the first step for Neuralink.

The longer-term goal is ""human/AI symbiosis"", something he describes as ""species-level important"".

The real trick will be developing a system which can interpret or translate the signals coming from the brain with a far greater level of accuracy. If and when that happens humans may be able to communicate with computers and other electronic devices in a way that is difficult to comprehend today.

Imagine being able to order a takeaway with your thoughts, or search the internet, or translate one language to another immediately in your head, just by thinking about it.

Musk himself has already talked about a future where his device could allow people to communicate with a phone or computer ""faster than a speed typist or auctioneer"".

In the past, he has even said saving and replaying memories may be possible, although he recognised ""this is sounding increasingly like a Black Mirror episode.""
Others are more sceptical: ""At the moment, I'm struggling to see an application that a consumer would benefit from, where they would take the risk of invasive surgery,"" says Prof Vanhoestenberghe.

""You've got to ask yourself, would you risk brain surgery just to be able to order a pizza on your phone?""

Instead she thinks the first mass market uses may be in stimulating the brain to tackle problems like treatment-resistant depression, dementia, and even some sleeping disorders, although the benefits are far from certain and research is at an early stage.

Dr Dean Burnett, honorary research fellow at Cardiff University's psychology school, also says there are enormous practical barriers to Neuralink becoming a mainstream consumer product.

""Everyone's brain is different. You can't just have one chip that fits everyone and does the exact same thing. It has to be a very meticulous process,"" he says.

""Technology advances, so do you have to get a new chip every five years? Would it be like having an old Nokia in your head, which was fun at the time and now it's not really much use?""

One thing that almost every expert in the field agrees on is that this kind of cutting-edge technology is decades away, at best, from a High Street brain surgeon near you.

Elon Musk, as well, has suggested that the ultimate goal is not to speed up your takeaway order, but to better protect humanity from the risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI), something he has described in the past as an ""existential threat"".

By better combining human and computer brains, we're less likely to be ""left behind"" as a species, he argues: ""With a high bandwidth, brain-machine interface, we can actually go along for the ride."""

Bus operators said they were working to speed up the reporting of cancelled services after commuters were left waiting for buses that never turned up.

The West Yorkshire Combined Authority transport committee launched a working group to look at the problem in January 2023 following complaints from passengers.

A report to Monday's committee meeting said an upgrade of electronic ticket machines to 4G mobile technology should improve the tracking of vehicles.

Speaking at the meeting, councillor Oliver Edwards asked bus operators Transdev and First for a commitment that future cancellations would be reported immediately.

Mr Edwards, who represents the Guiseley and Rawdon ward on Leeds City Council for Labour, said: �It�s a big issue in the area I represent and it�s an issue in many wards, especially outside of the city centre.

�It can be very serious for people if they don�t know whether the bus is coming.�

Mr Edwards also criticised First for not sharing bus performance data, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.

He said: �When we�ve asked for data, we�ve either been told it will be provided, but several months later we are still waiting for that, or we�ve been told it can�t be shared because of commercial sensitivity.

�What commercial sensitivity is it when there�s no competition on that route?""

'We do pretty well'
Brandon Jones, head of external relations at First, said the reporting of cancellations was improving after computer software changes.

�There are some issues around data flow,"" he told the meeting.

""We are very aware of these issues that occur for customers - the vast majority of the time it works well.�

Responding to the criticism about performance data, he said: �We do provide a lot of data through the combined authority already and we have had conversations around opening that up. �

Paul Turner, Transdev commercial director, said cancellation systems were being upgraded at his company.

�I think we do pretty well at getting our cancellations up to date,"" he said.

�We certainly aren�t perfect at doing it, but rest assured we do keep on top of that and ensure that we are getting the processes right behind it.�"

Water treatment expert Salinity Solutions teamed up with indoor salad producer GrowUp Farms in Sandwich, Kent, for the 10 -day trial.
Wastewater from the growing process, as well as elsewhere on the site, was collected and re-circulated twice, using a unique pressure system.
Liam Burlace, co-founder of Salinity Solutions, said: �This allows us to reach much higher recoveries making more fresh water accessible.""The standard technology used in the industry is called reverse osmosis, in which water is purified by pumping it through a semi-permeable membrane.
Salinity Solutions has developed a way of re-circulating the water, to treat it twice in an energy-efficient way.
Mr Burlace said: �The aim here is to treat water better, so we want to extract as much fresh water as possible, whilst minimising the energy consumption of the system.�

The GrowUp Farms� Pepperness site spans just five acres in Sandwich, but has the equivalent of 1,000 acres of growing space in a controlled environment, powered by renewable energy.

Salad crops for supermarkets are grown in fertilised water, rather than soil.

GrowUp Farms says the ground-breaking batch reverse osmosis technology - the first in the world to be manufactured commercially - could have a major impact on reducing wastewater, not only in the food sector but in many other sectors around the world, helping to solve the emerging global water crisis.

In the trial at the Sandwich site, rain water, water used for cleaning and �old� irrigation water were recycled.GrowUp Farms impact director, Gillon Dobie, said: ""Globally, demand for water is set to double over the next five years.

""Water treatment consumes 4% of the world�s total electricity production and conventional reverse osmosis systems are traditionally energy intensive.

""Crucially, Salinity Solutions� technology uses half the energy of existing systems while recovering up to 98% of clean water.""

Much of what is left over from the process is concentrated fertiliser, which can also potentially be recycled.

'Fantastic innovations'

Senior lecturer in environment and sustainability at the University of Surrey, Dr Zoe M Harris, said: ""Vertical farms are already fantastic innovations in that they already recycle their water. They are closed loops, recirculating systems. So we already have a saving there.

""By collaborating with Salinity Solutions, they are basically doubling up on their advantage.
""If they can further recover precious water and do that in a way that's economic and sustainable, it really will escalate and push forward vertical farming and controlled environment industries to be more sustainable.�
Salinity said the technology could also be used outside the food sector, for example at wastewater treatment plants, where nutrients such as phosphates and nitrates need to be removed.
The trial has now finished and the results will be analysed.

""I don't see people from my background wherever I have worked... South Asian women are far and few between.""Ms Aziz, 22, encouraged others from her background to seek a career in technology which she said is a ""very good and viable career option"".

""Your work life balance is brilliant in comparison to folks in healthcare or big pharma,"" she explained.

According to research by employer Hired, 18% of technology roles are filled by women and a third of those are Asian.

The former Luton sixth form student said she was ""very fortunate"" her parents did not discourage her from a career in STEM - science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

""Engineering is seen as a viable career choice for men, more traditional south Asian parents don't advocate for their daughters to go into it,"" she said.

She added: ""South Asian women are usually being told to pursue biology or medicine related careers.""The software engineer met Faris Elsayad at a Muslims in Tech event in January 2023.

Two weeks after they started working together they created the first prototype for Auralyse AI which is now available for people to use online for free.

""Students from less affluent backgrounds are less likely to apply and get offers at their dream schools,"" Ms Aziz explained.

She said she attended a ""poorly performing public school"" in Luton and many of her friends ""didn't know how to present themselves or what admission committees look for.""

Currently their platform focuses on those looking to study subjects such as dentistry or medicine as Mr Elsayad comes from a background in dentistry.

Users record themselves answering questions from admission interviews and the AI provides feedback on their communication skills and how well they answered the question.

Candidates are then provided with advice about how they can improve.

An estimated three million strawberries have been produced by the project at a farm, at Carrington near Boston, owned by Sir James Dyson.

Grown under glass, the fruits have been picked by a workforce including 20 robots taught to recognise when they are ready.

The firm said it showed the capability of technology to aid British growing.

There are many reasons why strawberries at not widely grown in the UK during the colder months, principally the British climate.

Another is the lack of foreign agricultural workers once the traditional picking season has finished.While the strawberries are grown under glass, millions of images of the fruit have been used to educate the robots.

Daniel Stockill, who developed the robot pickers, said: ""Over the years we have taken tens of millions of images of strawberries and we have put it through an algorithm.

""We have managed to teach the robot what is a good strawberry and what is not a good strawberry.""

Steve Barker from Dyson Farming said: ""Innovation and engineering is part of our DNA being associated with Dyson Technology"".The firm said it avoids the unnecessary food miles that come from imported strawberries by extending the British growing season.

A computer-controlled weather system ensures the strawberry plants are given the optimum climate to flourish, without a large energy bill.

""The carbon footprint is contained here within these 26 acres,"" Mr Barker said.

""An onsite anaerobic digestor produces all the heat and power required by the glasshouse.""

He said the firm has more projects in the pipeline to show the capabilities of ""British growing when partnered with engineering and technology""."

Its US parent company said the move was part of a planned relocation to California, where it hopes to revive its dreams with a new business partner.

ALI Technologies' hoverbike was heavily publicised - with Prince Albert II of Monaco pictured atop the craft at one point.

But it never sold in big numbers.

The bike, which executives once said was inspired by Star Wars, resembled a kind of aerial water scooter.

It could fly for about 40 minutes at up to 100km/h (62mph) on a single charge.

Chief executive Daisuke Katano said he hoped it would provide nothing less than a ""new method of movement"".The bike went on sale in 2021 for a price of $680,000 (�534,000).

But the underlying business had troubles from the start, most significantly laws in Japan - and other places - prohibiting the devices from flying over city roads.

What's standing in the way of the flying car?
Ben Gardner, partner at law firm Shoosmiths, told the BBC that regulatory barriers meant the hoverbike, despite its ""ground breaking"" technology, ended up being of ""limited use"".

""With further research and development, engagement with government authorities, and marketing it could have stood a chance - at least in terms of more real world testing and deployment"", he said.

""But all of this takes time and money - two things that ALI unfortunately ran out of.""

Last year, ALI Technologies agreed to be acquired by the US firm Pono Capital Corp - a move that led to its shares being listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange and that it hoped would raise money.

But nearly all of Pono's investors chose to sell their stock after the listing, according to Bloomberg, denting the price in a way the Japanese firm could not recover from and leaving the firm with little new cash.

In October, ALI's US parent company, Aerwins Technologies, said it was relocating operations from Tokyo to California to focus on redesigning the hoverbike and wining regulatory certification there instead.

It announced a partnership in December with another US firm to help advance its plans and stopped operations in Japan. It said it hoped to offer the new vehicle for sale at a $200,000 price point.

""Following an evaluation of the viability of other areas of the company's business... we discontinued our non-core operations formerly carried out by our wholly owned indirect subsidiary, ALI,"" the company said in a regulatory filing onTuesday.

Many tech firms are vying to bring flying vehicles to urban areas.

A prototype flying car completed a 35-minute flight between Slovakian international airports in Nitra and Bratislava in 2021 and received certification in the country in 2022 although further details on its project are sparse.

Meanwhile in the US, the ""Model A"" flying car received a Special Airworthiness Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration in 2023.

In the US, retailers such as Amazon and Walmart are also experimenting with delivering parcels by drone to people's homes."

As they left the stage at Madison Square Garden, the band were replaced by flying avatars who launched into the hit song God Gave Rock 'n' Roll to You.

The technology, originally developed for the Abba Voyage show, will allow them to stay on the road in retirement.

Gene Simmons said the band could now be ""forever young and forever iconic"".

Singer Paul Stanley added: ""What we've accomplished has been amazing, but it's not enough. The band deserves to live on because the band is bigger than we are.

""It's exciting for us to go the next step and see Kiss immortalised.""

Abba reunite to launch 'incredible' virtual concert

Kiss star Simmons calls for Stormont restoration
The avatars were designed by George Lucas's visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and financed by Swedish conglomerate Pophouse Entertainment, which is co-owned by Abba's Bj�rn Ulvaeus.

The companies previously collaborated on the Abba Voyage show, which recreates a 1970s-era Abba concert in a custom-built London arena. That show makes an estimated �2m per week.

However, Kiss's avatars seem unlikely to be as grounded in reality as Abba's digital replicas. The characters that appeared in New York were 8ft tall, breathing fire and shooting electricity from their fingers, while floating above the audience.

""These four individuals already have superpowers. We want to be as open as possible,"" said Pophouse CEO Per Sundin.

The digital characters were created from data captured while the band performed in motion capture suits earlier this year.

However, Kiss have yet to unveil their plans for the avatars.

""We're going to figure it out after the tour,"" said Sundin. ""Is it a Kiss concert in the future? Is it a rock opera? Is it a musical? A story, an adventure?""Known for their eye-catching make-up and larger-than-life performances, Kiss became one of the biggest arena rock acts of the 1970s and 80s.

Their hits include Rock And Roll All Nite, Black Diamond, I Was Made For Lovin' You and Crazy Crazy Nights.

They staged their first farewell tour in 2001, but have regularly returned to the road - with the current line-up including founders Stanley and Simmons alongside guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer Eric Singer.

It is not thought former members like Peter Criss and Ace Frehley will be part of the avatar shows.

Last summer, Simmons, 74, mused that Kiss might continue beyond their final concert in ways that ""even I haven't thought of"".

That included the suggestion of recruiting an entirely new band to dress up and play Kiss's greatest hits.

""I have no problems with four deserving 20-year-olds sticking the make-up back on and hiding their identity,"" he said.

For 10 years, Shannon, now 21 and at college, has had to communicate through a computerised speech programme.

Now, for the first time, people like her have the chance to regain their Welsh accents.

Shannon was given a similar programme to that used by the late scientist Stephen Hawking.

It meant that, almost overnight, her Welsh accent was gone and her thoughts and feelings were shared in a voice that sounded more like an American man.

""It doesn't sound like how I did before my accident,"" she said.

""I would like a voice that sounds like my family or friends from Pembrokeshire.""

Child speech support boards launched in parks
The schoolgirl who is too anxious to speak
Shannon is one of dozens of young people from Wales who hope to be able to speak in their native accent for the first time thanks to new Welsh government funding.

Unlike in England and Scotland, regional dialects have not previously been available for children and teenagers in Wales who rely on technology to help them speak.

Ella Rees, 19, who has cerebral palsy, said: ""I am from Cardiff, but I talk like I'm from England. It's not the real me.""

Ella communicates through a device that recognises her eye movements.

Although her facial expressions show all the signs of an excitable and energetic teenager, the voice that comes out sounds like a middle-aged woman.

""In my head, my voice is like I'm from Cardiff. I want a Welsh voice because it would feel more like it's me talking.

""I think it will be funny at first, but then it will be amazing.""Ella and Shannon's college, National Star in Cheltenham, has agreed to fund bespoke voices for them both as part of a project aimed at giving people a greater sense of identity.

The Welsh government has also funded a new initiative to allow children and teenagers to choose between north and south Wales accents on the NHS for the first time.

Previously, only Scottish or English were available.

The new pre-recorded voices will also give users the ability to speak in both Welsh and English.

Six-year-old Lina, from Hengoed, Caerphilly county, will be one of the first to receive a new bilingual voice.

Her mum Rebecca said the voice Lina had been using was ""very, very English"" and it was obvious she did not sound like other children in the area.

""It can be really jarring when your voice doesn't match what the rest of the community sounds like, so for her to be able to have a voice that matches what her peers sound like - not just in English but going into a Welsh medium school - it's ground-breaking,"" she said.

""I can't wait to go into school and hear her speak exactly like her peers are speaking, I can't wait to hear her sound like the six-year-old that she is.""The Welsh government is providing funding for eight new bilingual voices for children and young people.

Dr Jeff Morris from the National Centre for Electronic Assistive Technology in Wales said: ""Eight voices aren't enough. Ideally, we'd like every voice to be as individual as possible.

""But you can change some of the parameters, sort of fine tuning the voice, so you can change the speed of articulation.""

Julie Morgan, Wales' deputy minister for social services, said children who used technology to help them speak ""should not face a barrier to sounding like their friends and peers"".

""I am delighted these new Welsh language and Welsh accented voices will help give them more options and a greater sense of Welsh identity,"" she said.

The Student Voice app can be used by pupils to report incidents that have made them feel vulnerable, whether they took place in person or online.

It will be made available on tablets around Woodlands Primary Academy in Bradwell, near Great Yarmouth.

Staff said they hoped the app would encourage youngsters to report anything impacting their lives.

Deputy head Laura Brett said: ""It just enables children another way to talk about things that are concerning them - or going well for them - whether in school, the community or in their home.

""They can go through and log their concerns and it will be fed back to me so I can deal with those.""A group of 10-year-old pupils said bullying was an important issue that can badly affect young people.

Enfys, meaning ""rainbow"" in Welsh, is an infrared spectrometer and will be assembled at Aberystwyth University.

It will be fitted to the European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin rover, which launches to the Red Planet in 2028.

Enfys will work alongside the robot's other camera systems to identify the most promising rocks to drill and test for evidence of ancient biology.

The development cost of �10.7m ($13.4m) is due to be announced by science minister Andrew Griffith at the UK Space Conference in Belfast on Thursday.

The Welsh spectrometer will be replacing an instrument from Russia.

UK-built Mars rover saved from museum retirement
Life on Mars? Australian rocks may hold clues.Moscow had previously been a partner on the mission but all its hardware was offloaded from the rover by Europe's space agency in protest at the war in Ukraine.

Enfys will be a direct replacement in terms of mass and volume but will carry a number of technical updates.

It will be hung from a mast holding the robot's camera platform, called Pancam, working in unison with high-resolution and wide-angle sensors to survey the Martian landscape.

""We will take a picture with Pancam and get a spectral measurement from Enfys,"" explained the university's Dr Matt Gunn.

""This will allow us to work out what kind of minerals are in the rocks,"" he told BBC News, adding: ""We'll be interested in the sorts of minerals that formed in wet environments, the kinds of environments that could potentially have harboured life.""Rosalind Franklin is designed to do something no previous Mars rover has attempted, which is to drill and retrieve rock samples from more than a metre underground. It is thought any evidence of present or, more likely, past life will be found beneath the planet's surface, away from the destructive effects of space radiation.

The six-wheeled Franklin robot was first approved way back in 2005. The project has since gone through a number of redesigns and funding crises. The fallout over Ukraine is just the latest setback and means the mission will not get to the launchpad for another five years now.

Much larger Russian components than the infrared spectrometer also need to be substituted with European-sourced elements, not least the rocket mechanism that will land Rosalind Franklin softly at a near-equatorial site on Mars known as Oxia Planum.The late inclusion of Enfys does have the benefit that its performance requirements can be revisited.

An example is the range of infrared wavelengths in which it will be working.

Previously, there was going to be a gap in sensitivity between what Pancam could detect and what the old Russian spectrometer could see.

Enfys will be set up so that there is a slight overlap.

""We'll now have spectral continuity from Pancam into the infrared, which is light we can't see with our own eyes,"" said Enfys team member Dr Claire Cousins from the University of St Andrews in Scotland.

""This mission will be very focused on looking for clay minerals, which have the greatest likelihood of preserving organic matter. And these minerals have very specific absorption bands in the infrared that Enfys will be able to see but that Pancam won't.""Aberystwyth University will be assisted on the new build by the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London, STFC RAL Space in Harwell, Oxfordshire, and Qioptiq Ltd in St Asaph, Denbighshire.

The �10.7m being spent on Enfys brings the total UK investment in the Rosalind Franklin rover to �377m. With other members of Esa and help from the US space agency (Nasa), the total cost of the robot project will be well in excess of �1bn.

Dr Paul Bate, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said: ""The UK-built Rosalind Franklin rover is a truly world-leading piece of technology at the frontier of space exploration. It is fantastic that experts from the UK can also provide a key instrument for this mission, using UK Space Agency funding.

""As well as boosting world-class UK space technology to further our understanding of Mars and its potential to host life, this extra funding will strengthen collaboration across the fast-growing UK space sector and economy.""

The Institute for Technology and Humanity said it wanted to enable researchers to better understand the ""double-edged sword"" that is AI.

Director Dr Stephen Cave said he hoped to minimise technological risks.

He said history had shown the need to harness advancements for the good of humans.

""Previous waves of technological transformation helped us thrive as a species, with higher incomes and life expectancy, and more people alive than ever before. But those waves also had huge costs,"" said Dr Cave.

""The last industrial revolution, for example, fuelled the rise of communism and fascism, colonial expansion and the greenhouse gases that now threaten the biosphere.

""Today, both the scale and speed of technology is greater than ever before.""

He argued that while we are growing accustomed to the breakneck speed of technological development, we are complacent about the prospect of it undermining our way of life.""Despite dramatic technological advancements, there are many things we find it hard to imagine changing, such as social and political systems, and - in somewhere like the UK - relative peace and prosperity,"" said Dr Cave.

""But the lesson of history is that technology can very easily provoke huge instability, including the collapse of democracy and all-out war.

""To avoid this, we need to take such possibilities seriously.""

The Institute for Technology and Humanity brings three Cambridge centres together under one banner and will contain historians and philosophers as well as computer scientists and robotics experts.

Dr Cave said: ""Disruptive new technologies are always double-edged swords, and there is nothing inevitable about either the triumph or disaster they cause.

""We need to proactively chart a course for more desirable futures, which is what our new institute has been set up to do.""

Cambridge University's vice-chancellor, Prof Deborah Prentice, said the institute was ""rising to this challenge of ensuring that human technologies do not exceed and overwhelm human capacities and human needs""."

Some have had tracking devices added to their cars and phones, a detective superintendent in the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said.

Lindsay Fisher also warned that smart controls for home heating, baby monitors and CCTV cameras can be used by perpetrators.

She was speaking at an event in Belfast on stalking laws in Northern Ireland.

""The place that you're meant to feel the most safe, somebody can be using that technology against you,"" she said.

Det Supt Fisher said social media and smart technology provide new ways for stalkers to target their victims.

""We have people that have had trackers added to their phones, to their vehicles,"" she said.

""So there's a rise in social media making people accessible, but actually also in smart technology.

""We think about all of the things that we can do from the touch of a button... whether that's putting our heating on from another location or setting the cooker to go on, but actually those can be used by perpetrators.

""Those can be used to change the usage of a baby monitor, change the usage of your CCTV outside your home.""Det Supt Fisher said over 95% of stalking victims are women.

She said examples of stalking behaviour they have seen can range from perpetrators following their victims, to sending them unwanted gifts, and ""constant, repeated"" and abusive messages.

Stalking Protections Orders (SPOs) came into effect in the region in October to give police further police powers to tackle stalking behaviours.

It followed the Protection from Stalking Act NI 2022 which brought Northern Ireland into line with other parts of the UK.

Since the legislation was introduced in April last year, police have arrested around 230 alleged stalkers and charged more than 100 people.

There have been 27 prosecutions relating to stalking between May 2022 and October this year.

Convictions for the most serious offences carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.

The event also heard around 70% of the files police have received on stalking relate to partners, ex-partners or family members.

Det Supt Fisher said there is a ""stereotypical image"" of a stalker being ""someone hiding in a bush and following a stranger"".

But she added: ""Almost all of our cases have a domestic or known-person element to them.""Clive Ruggles, whose 24-year-old daughter Alice Ruggles was murdered in Gateshead in 2016 by an ex-boyfriend who was stalking her, was among those who spoke at the event.

He said ""without a doubt"" the legislation introduced in Northern Ireland will help protect victims, but any breaches of protection orders must be properly followed up by the authorities.

""We've got the tools now - we've got to use them properly,"" he said.

To anyone who is a victim of stalking, he added: ""Really do tell someone about this - don't suffer in silence."""

Yorkstone paving is highly prized for its durability and weathered look and can be expensive to replace due to its price.

Leeds City Council said it was now marking slabs with a traceable liquid only visible under ultraviolet light.

The authority said it hoped it would help identify stolen slabs and cut the cost of replacing them.

Yorkstone is only mined from quarries in Yorkshire and has a long history of being used on streets in Leeds.

Helen Hayden, the council's executive member for sustainable development, said the authority hoped using the traceable liquid would send a clear message that thefts would ""not be tolerated"".

""The theft of Yorkstone paving slabs costs taxpayers in Leeds tens of thousands of pounds per year at a time when council budgets are in crisis, as well as creating health and safety risks and ruining the look and feel of some our most historic streets and walkways,"" she said.

Curriculum requirements loom large, and a plethora of online resources promise solutions, but few offer a clear path. Some materials present mere islands of information�worksheets chock-full of facts, videos showcasing environmental problems, or tree-planting activities that don�t delve into root causes of climate change. Others promote superficial service: clean-up days or recycling drives that don�t develop deeper understandings of interconnected environmental systems.
These well-intentioned efforts often leave students with fragmented knowledge, a sense of helplessness, and limited agency. They grapple with the �what� but struggle with the �why�: Why is climate change happening? How do our actions impact the environment? What sustainable solutions exist, and how can we advocate for them? This approach fails to cultivate critical thinking, systems thinking, and problem-solving skills essential for tackling complex sustainability challenges.



As sustainability pioneers like Stephen Sterling and David Orr have advocated for decades, a holistic approach to sustainability education is crucial. We must move beyond mere �sustainability days� or extracurricular clubs that impact only a few eager students. To nurture sustainability mindsets and equip young people with tools for navigating an uncertain future, we need a clear framework that develops students� content knowledge, critical thinking, and agency to take action. A framework that offers a mental model and structure for teachers to plan meaningful, holistic sustainability-oriented learning.



Drawing on my years spent working with teams, teaching, and researching sustainability education, I�ve developed a framework that consists of three key learning phases: learning about, learning for, and learning as sustainability.�
Learning ABOUT Sustainability



The foundation of this framework is the building of students� comprehensive understandings of environmental and social systems. Aligned with curriculum standards, educators should emphasize hands-on engagements, real-world case studies, and connections to the natural world. This about phase of sustainability education is vital to the understanding of interconnectedness, a key concept in sustainability education and natural sciences. The goal is for students to grasp examples of sustainability, what makes something sustainable and, therefore, what makes something unsustainable.



During a recent grade 5 unit titled �Renewable Energy,� I observed how spending significant time in the about phase had a huge impact on student learning in the long term. Having delivered this unit in previous years, the teachers developing the unit felt that it was imperative to emphasize scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding before delving into discussions about renewability versus nonrenewability.�



They did this through a number of scientific inquiries and investigations where students explored the concept of potential and kinetic energy and how energy can be stored and transferred. Students used Frayer models and other visible thinking tools to develop solid conceptual understanding, which enabled teachers to identify misconceptions and teach accordingly. Establishing this depth of understanding set a foundation of knowledge for the rest of the unit, allowing students to develop informed and robust opinions moving forward.



Through this experience, we learned that we should align sustainability instruction with curriculum standards (often science-based); build a strong knowledge base using hands-on activities; use this phase as an opportunity to build connection with the natural world; utilize real-world case studies and local examples; and employ visible thinking tools to demonstrate understanding.



Learning FOR Sustainability



While acquiring knowledge is vital, the true essence of sustainability education lies in developing skills for active contribution. The for phase focuses on cultivating key 21st-century skills like critical thinking, systems thinking, creativity, and ethical responsibility.�



Through activities like case study comparisons, students can develop systems thinking by analyzing interconnected elements and potential consequences of actions and behaviors. Creativity comes into play as students propose solutions, while critical and ethical questioning encourages nuanced perspectives and avoids shallow arguments.



In the aforementioned Renewable Energy unit, students engaged in critical thinking activities based on case studies comparing various energy sources in different parts of the world. Students practiced systems thinking and worked to understand complex issues by drawing system maps, considering stakeholders, and identifying differing perspectives. They discussed the nuances of safe, clean, and renewable energy, challenging reliance on fossil fuels and exploring the limitations of renewables. This rich learning was made possible because of the strong content knowledge they�d built in the about phase.



Key actions as practitioners included providing opportunities for comparison and contrast; utilizing visible thinking tools like systems maps to highlight complexity; employing provocative questions to spark discussion and challenge assumptions; and creating a safe space for critical thought and challenging ideas.



Learning AS Sustainability



The pinnacle of sustainability education is when knowledge, skills, and dispositions translate into meaningful action.�



The as phase involves students� applying acquired knowledge and skills to such action�by initiating school sustainability programs, collaborating with local organizations, or participating in community-based projects. The focus, here, is on translating theory into tangible contributions that address sustainability challenges. Action projects should be student-led with teacher guidance, building upon the about and for phases. Students can utilize their learning to develop authentic action points that address genuine needs, moving beyond tokenistic efforts.



Students in the Renewable Energy unit applied their learning through action projects based on their takeaways from the previous phases of the framework. Some designed light switch signs to promote mindful energy use. Others focused on fundraising for the installation of additional solar panels on the school roof, demonstrating alternative energy solutions. Teachers encouraged students to work in and lead small groups, with educators acting as coaches rather than project leaders.



The transferable principles, here, are to involve students in service projects and collaboration with local partners, include small acts within the school community, position the teacher as a coach and facilitator, and empower students to use prior learning to develop authentic action points.



Effective sustainability education revolves around learning about, for, and as sustainability. This framework is not a rigid formula, but rather a guide for ensuring that each element is present when teaching sustainability. It goes beyond theory, empowering students to make a positive impact on their environment and society.�



In the context of 21st-century education, a holistic approach not only supports academic rigor and understanding, but also embeds key skills, fosters agency, and develops competencies vital for an uncertain future. By approaching sustainability as a necessary component of cross-disciplinary education, we can shift toward a more sustainable future."

But we must be prepared to hear the honest, insightful, surprising, critical, and at times angry perceptions that young people can offer. I recently worked with a school district that has been focused on improving the experiences and outcomes of Black students. I was brought in to help the district �do better� by its Black students. The district asked me if I could help to create a plan of action or set of professional learnings to help improve Black student outcomes across the district. 


The first question I asked was �Have you talked to the Black students yet?� After receiving a negative to that question, that was my first data point to collect. How can we figure out how to support and serve Black students without first talking to Black students? In response, I was part of a team that did just that; over the course of a three-month period, we held �listen and learn� sessions with hundreds of Black high school students about their likes and dislikes of their schools, what they wish teachers knew about them, how to make schools better, what contributes most to their learning, and their experiences with their peers. These data (which were collected anonymously) were powerful, sad, infuriating, and enlightening. As follows, you will see some of the comments (data) that came from Black students about their experiences in school. Students were provided several prompts and then asked to respond on sticky notes. The prompts are followed by a sampling of responses.



What should teachers/staff know about Black students that they don�t already know?
�We are humans just like everyone else; we are not angrier or criminals just because we are Black.�

�I feel like they should know Black students aren�t all the same or act the same.�

�I want them to know that we do care to be something and be successful in life. I want them to care and put the same amount of effort they put in other students to us.�

�I feel like teachers and staff should know that Black students aren�t as strong and tough as some may appear. We do have feelings, and some stuff really does hurt.�

�Teachers should know that skin color does not equal the way somebody learns, and we are all here for the same reason.�

What would you like to see in the curriculum that would better support you as a student?

�I would like to see more real-life application of the curriculum, and I would like to see more teachers encourage Black and Brown students to take Advanced Placement/Honors.�
�I would like about three minutes to ask how we as students are doing, especially if it is an elective. Three minutes to do a mental check-in won�t hurt our instruction time.�

�I want to see teachers trying as hard as the students, and I want more time to study.�

�To help me out when I need it and stop guessing I am a dumb person.�

�I would like to see more talk about our heritage as Black people. There are a lot of things about Black culture and history that get overlooked.�

�Stop expecting very little/too much from me. I know that I am an intelligent Black student, but it should not be surprising. I want to succeed like everyone else. Don�t put me in the spotlight.�

All these responses are part of a large data set that highlights how Black students see school, but the comments highlight some of the raw, unedited, and direct views that Black students have about their teachers and schools, which need to be taken seriously by school personnel if there is a real commitment to support Black students under an equity framework. Data can be compelling and insightful, but at times it can be sad and discouraging yet informative about the work that needs to be done. If one of our key goals is to recognize and repair harm for students, asking them in what ways they believe they have been harmed is the most authentic way to capture those injuries. Our students are brilliant, insightful, and highly intelligent. They are more than capable of letting us know what they think, feel, and need. The equity issue is whether we are willing to listen. And, if not, why?

EXAMINING DATA THROUGH A DISPROPORTIONALITY LENS

An important data indicator is the concept of disproportionality, which refers to a group�s representation in a particular category that exceeds expectations for that group or differs substantially from the representation of others in that category. For example, special education has been deemed an area where students of color are represented in higher numbers than they are in the general population (Harry & Klinger, 2014). Disciplinary disproportionality is another area that encompasses the significantly high rates at which students of color are subjected to discipline referrals, suspensions, expulsion, and school arrests. School leaders and practitioners should always be assessing schoolwide data and individual data to determine if certain groups of students are being subjected to differential or unfair treatment. At the school or district level, leaders might ask the following questions:

What is the racial/ethnic breakdown of students who are suspended and expelled?

What is the racial/ethnic breakdown of students who are in GATE courses?

What is the racial/ethnic breakdown of students who are in Advanced Placement/Honors and International Baccalaureate courses?

What is the gender breakdown of students in leadership positions?

How many students whose first language is not English are in advanced courses?

How many students with disabilities are in advanced classes?

What is the graduation rate for non-white students?

For classroom teachers, similar types of reflective data points should be occurring that help them think about their own practice and ensure that some students are being recognized and affirmed, while others are being rendered invisible, surveilled, or punished. Questions to think about for practitioners could include these:

Do I call on the same students consistently?

Do I try to offer affirming comments to all my students?

Whose name have I not called today?

How have I made sure to recognize my quiet students?

What are the types of comments that students have heard from me today?

Who have I recommended for leadership opportunities, and why?

What has the racial/ethnic/gender breakdown been of students who I have disciplined or sent to the office?


DISAGGREGATED DATA

By now, it should be clear that student data can be quite revealing, but only when we are willing to take a deeper dive into what the data are really telling us. The disaggregation of data involves data that have been divided into detailed subcategories. It can reveal inequalities between different subcategories that aggregated (large) databases cannot. Often, larger data sets can paint a positive picture of something such as district achievement rates, but a more analytical look at the data can highlight disturbing outcomes. Most disaggregated data are numerical, but it is possible to have categorical disaggregated data as well. For example, many schools will boast about a high school graduation rate that may be close to 90%�95%, which is an impressive feat. However, the disaggregated data would ask, What are the graduation rates for students with IEPs? How many students who are multilingual learners graduated? What are the graduation rates for Black or Indigenous students? 



A close look at �disaggregated data reveals that, in some cases, the graduates for those subgroups are only in the 60%�65% rate, which is completely unacceptable. While the numbers might be low, the percentage is still important. Losing one student is one too many. At the classroom level, a teacher may have taught a lesson, and it appears that most of the students understood the concept being taught. Only after disaggregating data across all students do teachers recognize that of the 30 students in a class, 6 failed to understand the concept. The disaggregating of data allows the teacher to see where there is a need for additional support for certain students to bring them up to par. One of the areas that also helps us to disaggregate data is when we look at big subject areas like reading or literacy.



The National Reading Panel has identified five key concepts at the core of every effective reading instruction program: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, evaluating reading for students in Grade 4 covers three key areas:



Reading for literary experience: Readers explore events, characters, themes, settings, plots, actions, and the language of literary works by reading novels, short stories, poems, plays, legends, biographies, myths, and folktales.

Reading for information: Readers gain information to understand the world by reading materials such as magazines, newspapers, textbooks, essays, and speeches.

Reading to perform a task: Readers apply what they learn from reading materials such as bus or train schedules, directions for repairs or games, classroom procedures, tax forms (Grade 12), maps, and so on.



Yet often schools will get a general (aggregated) reading score for students, but this amorphous score does not provide educators�nor does it provide the students and parents/ caregivers�with an accurate assessment of where a student may not have been taught well. Is the student strong in phonemic awareness, but needs more support in reading comprehension? Does that student show strong ability to identify characteristics, sequence, and plot of a text, but struggle with reading to perform a particular task? Disaggregation of test scores gives a better glimpse into where there is need for additional support and avoids a generalizing of what needs a student has or does not have in a particular subject area.



If schools and districts want to keep an open eye on becoming equity focused, understanding data and creating more data-informed decision-making processes are a must. However, in a number of my interactions with teachers, I have been told that many do not understand much of the data that are given to them from their schools. Having data is important, and understanding data is vital, but using data to inform decision making around curriculum, instruction, assessment, and policies can be transformative. To that end, district and school leaders bear a major responsibility to make data accessible, understandable, and usable for school personnel, students, and parents/caregivers. Among the steps that can be taken are the following:



Creation of data teams. The purpose of data teams is to create a collaborative community of stakeholders who can discuss data, identify important trends, and serve as the conduit to the rest of the school or district. These teams can help ensure that multiple voices and perspectives are honored when interpreting data and share a consistent message with members of the school community. While each school is responsible for determining the composition of their data teams, a diverse representation of school personnel across grade levels and years of experience is highly recommended to ensure that multiple perspectives (and analyses) are honored.



Offer ongoing professional development on data. Most schools offer professional development on a multitude of topics. However, what is often missing are ongoing learning sessions that explain to teachers and staff what data are being collected and how to interpret these data. Having someone with expertise who can go over data, address any questions, and be a resource for those seeking greater clarity can help to increase awareness around data. The more valuable professional learning sessions occur when teachers can demonstrate how they use data in their classrooms to inform instruction and student learning. Moreover, teacher training that has an explicit focus on equity-driven data is largely absent in most school districts.



Identify user-friendly data platforms. A step that can be useful for building data literacy is the incorporation of user-friendly data formats. Many districts have platforms that allow parents/caregivers and students to track student progress. Using learning management systems that allow users to track student performance can be a game changer for parents/ caregivers and students. Many find these formats quite useful to monitor daily, weekly, and monthly progress. Identifying a format that teachers, staff, students, and parents/caregivers find beneficial can go a long way in creating more transparent and user-friendly ways to track student work and progress. There are also lots of platforms that allow school personnel to see trends, patterns, and areas of concern for students. Each district should be diligent in identifying the platform that works best for them.



Talking to parents/caregivers about data. One of the ways that equity comes to fruition is when all stakeholders feel as if they are seen, are valued, and have a voice. Belonging matters. To that end, schools should strive toward finding ways to get parents/caregivers engaged in school-related matters. Schools can make major strides to be inclusive by offering seminars, webinars, and learning sessions that are specifically for parents/caregivers about how to navigate data platforms about their schools, their students� performance, and various resources that are available to support learners. 



In the spirit of transparency and openness, such endeavors send a clear message to parents/caregivers: We want you to be informed and knowledgeable about what we are doing as a school community, how your child is doing academically, identifying supports for your child, and offering concrete ways about how best to access your child�s teachers. Such efforts can go a long way to invite parents/caregivers into the learning process. Examples of such forms of parental engagement may be more popular at the primary grades but could be strongly encouraged at the middle and high school grades as well."
Education,43,Effective Transition Assessment for Students With Disabilities,https://www.edutopia.org/article/effective-transition-assessment-students-disabilities,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hero_blog_special-education_administration-and-leadership_photo_iStock_1405791752_SeventyFour.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,13-02-24,A mandatory assessment process is a crucial step in ensuring students� success after high school.,Effective Transition Assessment for Students With Disabilities | Edutopia,"As soon as a child is found to be eligible for receiving special education services, their school and family are expected to work collaboratively to create an individualized education program (IEP) that indicates the school services that support the student�s individualized needs. All IEP services are provided by public schools free of charge. After high school graduation, or when students turn 22 years old (whichever comes first), IEP services are immediately terminated. 



Therefore, it�s essential to have a well-structured transition plan in place while students are in school, so that they can be equipped with the skills to lead a successful adult life after high school. Transition assessment is a cornerstone of transition planning.



Transition Assessment is Mandatory



According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA 2004), all states are mandated to begin transition planning for pre-K to 12 students with disabilities by the time they�re 16 years old. Its purpose is to ensure that students learn the needed skills before graduating from high school. Transition assessment is the key to successful transition planning. Its results allow the IEP teams to provide services and support that match students� interests, preferences, strengths, and needs.



Let�s demystify four myths about transition assessment.



Myth 1: The annual IEP evaluation and the three-year reevaluation can replace transition assessment.



Reality: Results of an annual IEP evaluation and three-year reevaluation can inform IEP teams of the cognitive, academic, and/or functional skills of youth with disabilities. However, they are far from sufficient. IDEA 2004 mandated that transition services should �facilitate the child�s movement from school to post-school activities, including postsecondary education, vocational education, integrated employment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living, or community participation.� To determine the right services, transition assessment focusing on these areas is a must.�



Myth 2: The main purpose of transition assessment is to identify future employment goals for students with disabilities.



Reality: Transition assessment is for all students with disabilities, not just those with severe disabilities. It includes post-school outcome areas such as postsecondary education, employment, independent living, community participation (day programs), and social relationships.



Myth 3: Transition assessment occurs only once, at the beginning of the transition planning, or is a once-a-year event to guide the development of the IEP.



Reality: Transition assessment is an ongoing process that takes place throughout and across the secondary school years of students with disabilities. Creating ongoing assessments can ensure that data are current and relevant, so that schools can identify the skills that youth still need to learn and develop.�



Myth 4: Only formal assessments must be used for transition assessment.



Reality: All types of assessments have pros and cons. Formal assessments are standardized and technically sound but rigid in nature and often can be conducted no more than once a year. Informal assessments are flexible and can be used numerous times throughout the year to monitor students� progress, but their reliability and validity are unknown. Therefore, multiple types of assessment should be used.

Transition Assessment supports self-determination

The ultimate goal of transition assessment is to help families and their youth with disabilities gain a better understanding of students� strengths and needs, so that they can have an independent and successful future.

IDEA requires youth to attend their own IEP meetings, so that they can be actively involved in their transition planning and make decisions for their own future. In order to do so, youth with disabilities need to be self-determined�they should have the ability to make choices, problem-solve, set goals, and evaluate what options are best for them. Youth with disabilities who are self-determined are more likely to experience success after high school. Because of this, schools should conduct self-determination assessment to identify how to help students develop their self-determination skills through quality instruction.

Types of Transition Assessment

Both formal and informal assessments that address training, education, employment, and independent living skills (where appropriate) should be conducted. Below are some sample transition assessments. These are commonly used by school professionals.

Education:
Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities and Achievement

Informal Reading Inventory: Preprimer to Twelfth Grade



Self-Determination Skills:
The Arc�s Self-Determination Scale�

American Institutes for Research (AIR) Self-Determination Assessment�



Employment:
CareerScope �

The Princeton Review Career Quiz�

Independent Living Skills:

Brigance Transition Skills Inventory

Independent Living Scale (ILS)



Who Can Be Involved?



Individuals who work closely with youth with disabilities can be involved in the transition assessment process. It�s important for school professionals to conduct a variety of formal and informal assessments to determine the educational, socio-emotional, and functional skills of youth with disabilities. Their families can also help in the assessment process and monitor their progress.



For instance, families can conduct an interest inventory, provided by the school, to gauge their youth�s strengths, interests, and needs. Families can also monitor their youth�s progress by conducting direct and indirect observations at home and share the observational data with the IEP teams. Families can keep track of how often their youth utilizes the measurement skills they have learned from school when preparing for a snack or a meal, for example.



It�s critical that families clearly understand each component of transition assessment. Additionally, schools should always provide non-English-speaking families with information and documents that are in their native language. Using assessments that incorporate youth�s dominant language can also provide IEP teams with a better understanding of the youth�s language needs.



interpreting Transition Assessment Data



After all needed assessments are complete, it�s time for the IEP team to analyze and interpret the collected data and ensure that youth with disabilities (and their families) understand the assessment results. The results should inform the team of the strengths, preferences, interests, and needs of youth with disabilities. The team uses those results to work collaboratively, develop postsecondary goals, and determine the appropriate next steps. Should the students continue advancing their education? If so, which areas do the students still need to strengthen? Should the students follow the vocational path? If so, what type of vocational training should the students focus on?�



Often, the IEP team will collaborate with community and/or state agencies, such as the Department of Developmental Services, that can help youth reach their postsecondary goals. These organizations may offer various kinds of support, such as internship opportunities, technological support, and personal care services. Many of them may continue supporting youth after high school."
Education,44,Preparing Students With Disabilities for Life Beyond School,https://www.edutopia.org/article/transition-planning-students-disabilities,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hero_blog_special-education_administrators_photo_iStock_1273041034_SDI-Productions.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,31-01-24,Transition planning is a crucial part of ensuring that students feel confident in their capabilities prior to graduation.,Transition Planning for Students With Disabilities | Edutopia,"Family and school partnership is an important component of�school success and student achievement. Engaging families of youth with disabilities is especially crucial. When students with disabilities enter middle and high school, schools and families need to begin to ensure that these young adults are prepared for life after graduation. As mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 (IDEA), transition planning is required for all youth with disabilities, not just the ones with severe disabilities. General education and special education teachers are part of their students� individualized education program (IEP) team, so they are required to be involved and know how to prepare and support their youth with disabilities and their families throughout the process.�



WHAT IS TRANSITION PLANNING?



Transition planning is a process. Since IDEA was revised in 2004, all states are mandated to begin transition planning for students with disabilities by the age of 16. Recent research shows that over half of the states and territories in America, such as Florida, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, have chosen to lower the required transition planning age to at least 14 years old, since they believe that this process should begin as early as possible.�



During transition planning, schools are obligated to collaborate with students with disabilities and their families. As a team, they will determine what education, experiences, supports, and services students with disabilities need in order to be prepared and lead successful adult lives beyond high school. This information needs to be embedded in the students� IEP and revisited each year.�


STUDENT AND FAMILY INVOLVEMENT



Student input in transition planning is required. This means that they need to attend their IEP meetings. Due to some students� disabilities, their involvement may be limited. However, educators and families are expected to provide support so that students can be actively involved in planning for their future. For instance, they can assist students to identify their strengths and interests and determine if they wish to continue their education or pursue a career. This valuable information guides the IEP team when identifying appropriate support and services.



Because transition planning begins prior to students� legal age of majority, their families should be involved in their children�s IEP team�collaborating with school professionals throughout middle and high school. Additionally, all materials provided to families should be available in their preferred language.



To ensure that families are aware of what transition planning involves and how they can be prepared, information about the process should be provided to them at least one year prior to the transition planning age. If the transition planning age in your state is 14 years old, that�s the time when students with disabilities enter high school, so information should be shared when the student is 13 years old. Due to a placement change, families need time and guidance to determine which high school is suitable for their child with disabilities, such as transitioning to a regular high school or a vocational high school.



TRANSITION ASSESSMENTS



Before postsecondary goals can be developed, schools are expected to conduct a variety of transition assessments that allow the team to gather information about the whole child in order to understand their strengths, interests, and needs related to �training, education, employment, and, where appropriate, independent living skills.� Other areas of assessment, such as self-determination, assistive technology, and college readiness, can also be included.



Transition assessment is an ongoing process that allows the IEP team to monitor students� progress toward postsecondary goals. Assessment tools used in this process can be formal (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales) and informal (John Litpak�s Transition-to-Work Inventory).�



DEVELOPING POSTSECONDARY GOALS AND MONITORING PROGRESS



When all needed transition assessments are complete, schools should share the assessment results with students with disabilities and their families prior to the initial meeting. The IEP team will use the collected data not only to create postsecondary goals for the students with disabilities, but also to determine the needed support and services.�



For example, if the results show that a student with disabilities has robust academic skills (strength) and wants to continue their education (interest), the team may consider giving them opportunities to take one or two courses at a community college or a four-year college or university to gain experience learning in those environments (education and training).�



Additionally, if the results show that the student has limited proficiency in performing household tasks (needs), such as laundry and cooking a simple meal, the team would need to determine how to strengthen the student�s skills in this area at school and at home. The student may need to be enrolled in a life-skill class (education and training), or their teachers may need to integrate the student�s learning with real-life situations so that they can apply what they�ve learned (independent living skills).



Once transition planning begins, the IEP team is required to monitor students� progress, conduct transition assessment, and revisit the postsecondary goals at least annually in order to determine if the students are making adequate progress toward the postsecondary goals.�



Students�with disabilities and their families may find the journey of transition planning to be a nerve-wracking process because there are many uncertainties. Families may also be concerned about the limited support their youth with disabilities would receive after exiting high school. However, with good planning, students with disabilities can gain the necessary knowledge and develop skills while in school so that they are prepared to lead successful and meaningful adult lives beyond high school."
Education,45,How Robotics Can Help Students in Special Education Learn Social Skills,https://www.edutopia.org/article/combining-robotics-social-skills-elementary-students,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shutterstock_1255382401-crop.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,29-01-24,Combining robotics instruction with social stories can help students figure out how to navigate friendship.,Combining Robotics and Social Skills for Elementary Students | Edutopia,"Social skills enable us to interact and communicate with others. They allow us to build and maintain friendships as well as process and implement conflict resolution strategies. Many teachers expect students to come into school with these skills. However, as a primary elementary special education teacher, I know that my students with disabilities�especially those with a primary diagnosis of autism or emotional disturbance�need to be explicitly taught social skills through social stories instruction.



Students with disabilities often need additional support when it comes to taking turns, sharing a preferred item, navigating directional tasks, participating in fire or shelter-in-place drills, and building and maintaining friendships.



Combining Robotics and Social Skills



Last year, my school started a robotics program, which I�ve been using to provide social skills instruction and increase student engagement. The activity begins with students reading or listening to a social story on friendship. I then ask students to create an anchor chart as a whole group that describes what friendship should look like (getting along), sound like (talking, laughing, smiling) and even feel like (happiness) that can be displayed in the classroom and easily referred to.



An unplugged activity, such as an interactive bulletin board, enables students to physically move pieces through a social skills scenario or social story from one area to another while focusing on how many turns or steps are needed to get to the end. You�ll need chart paper, markers, an interactive bulletin board display (I repurposed an old wall calendar), Velcro, copies of directional buttons, a planning page, and a read-aloud story on a designated social skill. To enhance the lesson, you can include photographs of your students, but that�s optional.



To prepare for the activity, print out copies of directional buttons�left, right, forward, and backward�and put Velcro on the backs. Students can manipulate them on the interactive bulletin board via Velcro, and they can use a planning page that assists with organization as well as enables them to visually �debug� their code before they transfer the copies of the buttons onto the bulletin board. The planning page will also show which directional buttons the students are going to use and the route that they will take.



Next, the students take turns navigating the pictures of themselves (if you chose to include pictures) around the bulletin board to their friend on the opposite side while �coding� or moving to pictures that demonstrate friendship.



The robots we use from VEX Robotics have the directions on them, which makes this activity much easier for students. Younger students may struggle a bit if they don�t know their left from their right. Timelines for learning robotics are very individualized to the student and can be differentiated easily. Some students learn how to code with touch within a week and can move on, while others may take longer. Robotics instruction can be presented to the whole group, small groups, or individuals, and is a great center activity as well.



Coding by touch enables students to demonstrate their knowledge of the social skill, and the unplugged activity lends itself to further discussion about why students chose the route that they did around the board. It also helps them to understand that there may be different ways to demonstrate friendship, but each one ultimately ends up with a similar outcome.




From Analog to Digital



Through scaffolding opportunities, students will use their prior knowledge of unplugged activities to start handling a small robot that requires coding of touch buttons to begin moving through a given scenario. To maintain consistency and routine, I have students use the same pictures demonstrating friendship as the activity above along with the planning page. However, this time, I place the pictures on a square field tile, and students need to manipulate and code utilizing the touch buttons on the robot (forward, backward, left, right) to navigate a photograph of themselves to their friend.



After they master coding with touch, students begin coding with coding cards (transparent cards with text) and a remote coder that connects to their robot to execute their code again utilizing the same picture cards.



Finally, the students are able to utilize a web-based, block-coding program to enable the movement of their robot to their friend on the tile field. This activity not only lends itself to repetitive practice opportunities but can serve as a formative assessment or exit ticket activity.



The level of difficulty does increase with the coder cards as the students read simple commands such as �drive 1, turn right, or stop.� In addition to the words, there are also pictures to depict what operation is presented for emergent readers.



A benefit of implementing robotics to assist in social skills instruction is that the execution can be differentiated for students. Students who have fine-motor concerns can more easily participate in the unplugged activity by physically manipulating the picture cards. Those with more advanced fine-motor skills may master coding of touch buttons and be ready to demonstrate their knowledge of coding and debugging through the coder cards. But all of them learn the same social skills and demonstrate high levels of student engagement.



This engaging and simple idea also lends itself to monitoring of individualized education plan goals through teaching of social skills that students with special needs often require."

Students were shouting and teachers were trying to calm them down. It was fire prevention week, and the local fire department was visiting our on-site preschool. Our school is unique in that my high school students have the opportunity to teach at the preschool each week. As the students, preschool and high school aged alike, learned about fire safety, I reflected on how lucky I was to be a career technical education (CTE) teacher.



CTE programs create meaningful work-based experiences for students in high school. Some CTE programs include biotechnology, education, engineering, multimedia, law, and public safety, as well as traditional vocational programs like cosmetology, auto technician, and construction trades. And those are opportunities  that students are looking for�in a recent Gallup poll, middle and high school students gave their schools a C+ in providing opportunities to explore careers.



CTE programs provide students with an opportunity to deepen their understanding of a potential career. My specific program prepares students to enter the field of education. Students have multiple experiences working with preschool- through high school�age students. Students will graduate with college credits and a comprehensive experience, which includes writing lesson plans, creating professional development, and doing a 120-hour internship.



Many high schools across the country are now including CTE in their curriculum to provide students with the experience they need to be successful after high school. Students are gaining real-world experience while earning their diploma.�



Provide Authentic Assignments and Learning Experiences



CTE programs create meaningful learning projects for their students. In my class, I follow a problem-based project for each unit and provide students with a model they can refer back to while they work. I usually find examples from the field so that students are modeling high-quality work. Students receive a rubric that outlines the criteria. Lastly, I use these questions when thinking about my units�the following are some examples:�



What experiences can my students engage with now?�

How can students partner with the community, industry professionals, and peers to complete the work?�

What skills will my students need in five years, 10 years, and beyond to be successful?�



Each unit should include a driving question. The driving questions allow students to make the content their own. Students can pinpoint exact ideas or concepts they want to explore more. Here are some examples of driving questions:�



How can we use technology to enhance student learning?

What points in the history of education impact student learning today?

How can we create equitable learning plans for students?�



Each unit includes an authentic learning experience for students. I have my students complete about five units each year. The following are examples of authentic learning experiences that can be used in any program.�



Podcasting: Students have the opportunity to research current issues and trends, interview industry professionals, and teach the community about that profession. Students can create, record, and publicize a podcast that is based on their CTE program. My students have created podcasts around homework being graded, why certain teachers are student favorites, and how schools can help students� mental health since my students are studying the field of education. Teachers could have their students brainstorm topics relevant to their career field.�



Museum Exhibit: Exposing students to the history and future of the industry is critical for them to immerse themselves in that field and dive deeper into the content. In this authentic learning project, students curate a collection of artifacts. Teachers should use this as a way for students to practice telling a story.



My students flipped this experience and went to a local museum and provided feedback on their current education programming. They learned about a different career field and also what goes into creating education programming that directly relates to their CTE program. My students were also able to attend a local museum and get the on-site professional development it offered to teachers.�



Career Fair: My students researched careers outside of teaching and hosted a career fair. Some of the jobs included child play therapist, curriculum developer, occupational therapist, and social worker. Students were tasked with finding out what further education and certifications were needed, as well as essential skills for that profession, and created an activity for the audience to engage in. Teachers can extend this project by inviting other students, administrators, and professionals to the fair. Students can also shadow real career fairs hosted in the community.�



Shark Tank: As job responsibilities and expectations change, students need to have a sense of entrepreneurship and business knowledge. The Shark Tank assignment is modeled after the show,�and students have the opportunity to create a product or service that can benefit their industry. Students extensively research their industry to understand its needs and create innovative solutions.�My students focused on creating technology that would help students with learning disabilities, an app that would detect learning disabilities based on student writing, and a service that would provide tutoring for students.�



Connecting Students to Their Community



Creating community partnerships and inviting in guest speakers can be a daunting task. However, these partnerships are essential to students� success. My goal is to provide students with professional experience and bring content to life. When creating a partnership, the guest speaker will work with students as they create their podcast, portfolio, or letter. One example is the student presenting to the guest speaker various ideas for improving reading strategies.�



This is a list of people I contact for partnerships and guest speakers:�



Professional organizations associated with the specific career field�

Local businesses�

Parents�

Advisory council�



I have a template that I use to email these organizations; I include goals for the partnership, the number of students, potential dates, and my contact information.�



My first contact is with professional organizations. For instance, the Association for Career & Technical Education provides teachers with resources, but I also find organizations associated with my specific field, like the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, the National Association of Special Education, and the American Psychological Association, to name a few. Attending professional development and local networking events also creates connections. I have my students attend future educator workshops to also learn networking skills. 



Programs like DECA, SkillsUSA, and Virtual Enterprises are also opportunities for students to engage with industry professionals. This year, I had a local music teacher speak to my students about music and brain development. After her lecture, she did a sample class with our on-site preschool. After the class, she debriefed her lesson with the high school students. The experience provided students with an opportunity to engage meaningfully with the content and engage firsthand with a professional.�



For new CTE teachers, it can be difficult to navigate the expectations of creating an excellent program. When I give my students authentic learning experiences that are embedded in the community, they get the opportunity to learn about future careers, and I find new excitement each time I�m with them."
Education,48,Supporting Newcomer English Learners as a General Education Teacher,https://www.edutopia.org/article/supporting-newcomer-english-learners-without-esl-teacher,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hero_blog_English-Language-Learners_photo_iStock_1498427343_PixelsEffect.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,18-01-24,"Even without a dedicated specialist, there are steps that teachers can take to support the success of this growing group of students in school.",Supporting Newcomer English Learners Without an ESL Teacher | Edutopia,"By 2025, one out of four children in U.S. schools will be an English language learner (ELL), and many educators are growing increasingly accustomed to having these students in their classrooms.
Yet there�s an imbalance in the amount of support that is typically given to this growing demographic and the professional training provided to general educators. It�s unlikely that there is an ELL specialist or bilingual educator in every classroom to support these students consistently throughout their school day.�

This presents a challenge. Newcomer ELLs, especially students with interrupted formal education (SIFEs), typically need one-on-one attention throughout their school day. Without such attention, general educators need to use alternate methods to address the needs of this special demographic. Here are some ideas.


Build a community



First, make it a community effort. Immediately partner ELLs with students who are friendly, personable, and willing to help. Before an ELL arrives, ask the class if there�s anyone who would be interested in volunteering. If an ELL shows up without notice, partner them with a student you think will be amenable to helping, and then check with them after class to see if they�re willing to be a guide for the rest of the week. This is mutually beneficial for both parties and can boost the confidence of all involved.



Depending on circumstances or how well the newcomer adjusts, you could also consider having a different �peer partner� every day or week until the newcomer becomes more comfortable and independent. In my experience, there�s usually at least one student who�s happy to take on this role voluntarily. It gives them a feeling of purpose and pride to be able to help a classmate. In a U.S. History class recently, I introduced a newcomer ELL, and after class, a peer, without prompting, introduced herself to the student and asked if she could help her find her next class.�



Make use of tools



Equip all students and staff with knowledge and access to a translation app on a computer or phone (Google Translate is most common). Such tools are more appropriate for upper-level elementary grades, as well as middle and high school. With the increase in ELLs in our schools, and also a push for multilingualism at the federal level, all students and staff should have a translation tool on their device and know how to use it. Students can utilize this through adulthood to help ease the inhibition of intercultural communication and facilitate dialogue when language is a barrier.



I find it fascinating to observe teenage native speakers of English interacting with a newcomer ELL for the first time, completely unaware of how to engage in a conversation using a translator, visuals, and gestures, and gradually developing the skills to communicate.�



Use actions and words



Another strategy is to model using physical movements linked with spoken language. Think of Simon Says but doing actions along with the ELL or for the ELL as you try to communicate. Enable and encourage classmates to use facial expressions, pointing, gestures, etc., when interacting with ELLs.�



Although this method of language exchange is limited, it can help develop a lifelong skill of being able to connect with people of varying linguistic backgrounds. In addition, using physical movements with language can help with remembering new words.�



Recruit volunteers



For grade 4 and above, solicit student volunteers for homework help and language tutoring. They can have the option to receive community service hours for this for a club or class requirement. Advertise this by posting signs around the school and outside your classroom door. Display sign-up sheets for volunteers to choose a day and time they can commit to, and also put this on the morning announcements. Welcome volunteers to stop by for whatever amount of time they�re available.



Collaborate with teachers who require their students to do community service hours. Publish a notice about this in the school paper or newsletter along with photos of peer tutors working with ELLs to encourage more students to participate. Ask a world language teacher if they�d be willing to give extra credit to students who volunteer.�



When student volunteers come to my classroom after school to tutor, I model teaching methods for them with the ELL student and guide them as they engage in conversation or discuss the homework so that the tutor can have an understanding of the language abilities of the ELL and a sensitivity to their feelings as language learners.�



If peer tutors are practicing English conversation and don�t know what to talk about with the ELL, I provide a list of topics and questions for reference.�



Engage ambassadors�



Seek multilingual students in the building who are interested in acting as a peer ambassador for newcomer ELLs. Introduce the newcomer ELL to peer ambassadors, and invite them to schedule a time when they can meet together to get oriented to the new school and have an opportunity to have discussion and ask questions.�



For example, there are two new Ukrainian students in my building who speak Ukrainian as well as Russian. Their counselor introduced them to students who speak Russian, and these students walked them to their classes on their first day.



Another student who speaks Russian was interested in meeting the new Ukrainians, so he stayed after school to practice speaking Russian. The newcomers appreciated this warm greeting.�



The above methods are a means for nurturing an environment that�s welcoming of linguistic and cultural diversity and cultivating a civic-minded community of students and staff alike."
Education,49,Preparing Students With Disabilities for the Transition to College,https://www.edutopia.org/article/preparing-students-disabilities-college,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hero_blog_Special-education_College-Readiness_photo_iStock_1349908693_Halfpoint.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,03-01-24,"There are important differences between disability accommodations in the K�12 and postsecondary settings, and teachers can help students understand them.",Preparing Students With Disabilities for College | Edutopia,"Statistics indicate that 55 percent of students diagnosed with a disability continue their education in a postsecondary setting. Information critical to postsecondary success, however, is rarely taught to students with disabilities.�



Below, I outline key information about differences in disability accommodation in K�12 and postsecondary environments. I then share activities that teachers can use to acquaint students with applicable policies and prepare them to navigate systemic complexities.��



Defining Disability



Before we consider high school and college contexts, it�s important to think closely about what we mean by disability. The United States Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is the special education law that ensures a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to eligible students diagnosed with disabilities. The legislation provides special education and related services on an individual basis to those students. The federal government provides definitions of 13 eligible disability categories�an integral part of the qualification process for receiving support services.��



The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act both define a person with a disability in this way: �A person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity.� The definition further includes �people who have a record of such an impairment, even if they do not currently have a disability, and individuals who do not have a disability but are regarded as having a disability.��



The ADA makes it unlawful to discriminate against a person based on that person�s association with disability.


Success vs. Access



Under IDEA, K�12 school districts utilize accommodations and modifications to curricular expectations to position qualifying students for success and to meet their unique needs in the classroom.�



Students are entitled to these alterations, which are a legally binding aspect of their individualized education program (IEP). Both general and special education teachers must implement them in all classes. If teachers and districts don�t follow IEPs, they may face legal action, most commonly resulting in a consequence of public-funded compensatory education.��



ADA and Section 504 were penned as civil rights statutes. The focus of both pieces of legislature is ensuring equal access to opportunity. At the college level, this translates into equal access to the opportunity to fully participate and receive the same benefits as their nondisabled peers. Therefore, the purpose of accommodations at this level is to ensure access�for students with disabilities. While the hope is that all students will be successful, accommodations are not provided to facilitate�success.��



Reasonable accommodations are a means to an end.�They are approved, as needed, on an individualized basis to ensure that students with disabilities are not subject to discrimination. If the individual�s disability presents a functional limitation that acts as a barrier to this access, accommodations are approved to remove such barriers. Student success is not a guarantee.



Student Responsibility



After students graduate from high school, as the legislature changes, so do their legal protections. According to mandates set forth by IDEA, school districts are responsible to search for, identify, and evaluate students who may require special education. When a teacher or school suspects that a student may possibly have a disability, that student must be evaluated to see if they qualify for Special Education support and services.��



This evaluation determines whether a qualifying disability (13 categories) is present, and if so, whether that disability negatively impacts the student�s performance and whether they would benefit from special education. Depending on the need, a school will implement an IEP or 504 plan.��



Under ADA and Section 504, a postsecondary educational institution is not responsible for identifying or diagnosing students with disabilities. Rather, the students themselves are now responsible to self-disclose their disability, request accommodations, provide supporting documentation to give evidence of said disability, and self-monitor the efficacy of their approved accommodations.�



Academic Standards and Expectations



All students with an IEP or 504 plan are entitled to modifications that their team determines are needed. Modifications change what the student is expected to learn. Modifications can also be applied to assessments, such as exams, assignments, or projects. In these situations, the IEP team decides upon specific accommodations and documents them in the student�s IEP. These alterations typically focus on student strengths, levels of performance, and the use of appropriate materials that are relevant to the general education expectations.



At the postsecondary level, reasonable accommodations are not provided to support students who are struggling academically.�They are provided to support students with disabilities who need them to have full access to opportunity. Additionally, none of the approved accommodation can pose a fundamental alteration to the program design or a substantial change in an element of curriculum. Simply put, all students must complete the same assignments, exams, projects, etc., as their nondisabled peers. No alterations to student expectations are permitted.��



Engaging and Educating Students�



To familiarize students with the above information, you can incorporate powerful preparatory activities in a student�s transition plan.�



Using a guided questionnaire, ask students to conduct research about disability service programs at the institutions they hope to attend. Or ask them to conduct an interview with personnel in disability services and report on the experience. These exercises can elicit engaging conversations about the changing expectations and legalities.�



Because self-advocacy is vital to student success, you may offer direct instruction in disability awareness and accommodation needs. Students who understand and have practice communicating about their disability, its effects, and accommodations are best-positioned to self-advocate.��



You can also support students� considerations of whether an accommodation is success-based or access-based.�For example, a student currently receiving the accommodation of �breaking large assignments into smaller segments� on their IEP would hear, at the postsecondary level, that this is �unreasonable,� since it�s geared toward a �success-based� outcome.��



On the other hand, if a student requires �extended time for assessments,� this is an access-based strategy, allowing the student an equal opportunity to demonstrate to their professors their knowledge and skill base.



Understanding differences in expectations and responsibilities is paramount in the successful transition for students with disabilities to college. As teacher, you can help educate students, fostering a positive adjustment and enhancing success."
Education,50,Boosting Students� Speaking Skills in Career and Technical Education,https://www.edutopia.org/article/teaching-communication-skills-cte,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/35693866123_42c7f13954_5k-crop.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,20-12-23,Students can build job-relevant skills�and confidence about speaking in class�by crafting and delivering speeches in CTE classes.,Teaching Communication Skills in CTE | Edutopia,"Classrooms are quiet. More teachers than ever have voiced concerns about students� hesitation to speak in class, whether in discussions, presentations, or responding to teacher questions. Glossophobia is the term for this fear of public speaking�one of the most prevalent fears in the world.�



In a recent meeting with ninth-grade teachers, they reported that students felt most comfortable, confident, and engaged in career and technical education (CTE) classes. This feedback sparked a possible solution to quiet classrooms: embedding public speaking in CTE. Below are five types of speeches that can support CTE students as they learn how to teach, negotiate, inform, interview, etc.�skills that will help them communicate well after graduation.



Demonstration Speeches�



Students need to be able to articulate skills learned. A basic demonstration speech will authentically assess their content-knowledge acquisition and skill proficiency. By breaking down a skill into small steps and demonstrating their ability to explain the process while informing their audience about the reason behind the process, students make their learning visible and practice job-relevant communication.



This can start with a minor skill like stripping wires. Students explain the objective of the activity, the tools they need to perform the task, problems that could occur, situations where they might need to apply this skill, safety measures involved, disposal of falloff; how to gauge what wire and tool they need to use, and other steps and strategies.



During a demonstration speech, the audience (teacher and classmates) can participate by analyzing the steps and determining if anything is missing, developing questions about methods or materials, assessing language used, and providing feedback regarding clarity of communication.�



To help students succeed, begin with something simple: prepping for a task or explaining the importance of a piece of safety equipment. The topics are infinite.�

Persuasive Speeches�



The powers of rhetoric�ethos (ethics/credibility), pathos (emotional impact), and logos (logic/reason)�will help students in every aspect of life. How might we foster these skills in the CTE classroom?�



Consider when a customer is deciding between fixing their car or trading it in for an electric car. What might a mechanic want to convince the customer of? Think about an addition on a house. What materials would you want the customer to use for studs? What does the customer need consider before making this decision? Think about a project manager who is developing a park in a small town. What might they need to consider or advocate for? How about a situation where a student will need to ask their employer for a raise�how might their speaking skills improve the likelihood of success?�



Developing a persuasive speech, applicable to these scenarios (which are all viable topics for students� speeches), requires research, organizing thoughts, developing a claim/stance, identifying a counter-claim and dispelling it, and delivering the final product with sincerity and confidence.�



The classroom audience can evaluate the rhetoric of the speech. Did the presenter truly persuade using the powers of rhetoric: ethos, pathos, and logos? Where and how? Ask listeners to cite evidence from the speech that includes these facets and to create questions to ask the presenter to further explain examples or challenge counterclaims.�



Elevator Pitches



In elevator pitch speeches, students have 45 seconds to introduce themselves and convince someone that their skill is important and necessary. They must also convince the listener that the topic is important and they need to learn more. An elevator pitch is an important skill for networking and creating opportunities.�



Listeners can critique the speech using the TAG method: Tell speakers something positive about their delivery, ask a question about the topic introduced, and give advice to improve their delivery.�



Informational Speeches



To practice this type of communication, students can present information a;out a new innovation in their trade. Students will research something they�re interested in pertaining to their CTE class; information about safety equipment, routines, and procedures; materials used in the industry; careers; etc. They can develop a presentation and share the information with the class to communicate its importance.�



The audience can develop three questions (per person) about the presentation to glean insight into the student�s depth of research. If students conduct a thorough investigation about their topic, they should be able to answer many questions with confidence.�



Motivational Speeches�



A major component of any job is building a team. The motivational speech will help students motivate colleagues to achieve the mission and vision of a company, project, or philosophy. The assignment could include a different mission, vision, or strategic plan for each student. The motivational speech will help students support their team when things are difficult while continuing to support the mission and vision of the company. If students are able to lead a team with confidence and positivity, they will be able to better achieve a deadline, goal, or vision.�



When listening to motivational speeches, students in the audience can identify different words or phrases that speak to the mission, vision, or strategic plan assigned to that student.�



These five speech opportunities will not only help students speak in front of the room, but also help students grow their confidence for interviews and customer interactions, which makes learning relevant and applicable to their lives in and beyond the classroom."
Education,51,6 Non-Education Books With Lessons for Teachers,https://www.edutopia.org/article/non-education-books-teachers,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iStock-1365018163-crop.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,15-12-23,Reading outside of the education field can provide insights that infuse teachers� practice with meaning.,Non-Education Books for Teachers | Edutopia,"I�ve consumed many educational books written to support classroom management, technology integration, and more.�
But outside of education, I�ve found titles, shared below, to support my growth as an educator, leader, and person, developing a reading practice that stimulates a new thinking space.



A Non-Education Reading List for Teachers



1. Soundtracks: The Surprising Solution to Overthinking, by Jon Acuff



Takeaway quote: �One of the greatest mistakes you can make in life is assuming all your thoughts are true.��



So much of education connects to the refrain, �the way we�ve always done things.� But when it comes to instruction, technology, and professional development, just because we�ve always done something doesn�t mean it�s the best�that�s what Acuff reminds us.�



When we get stuck in a rut, we fail to ask: How could this look different? Or we engage in self-judgment that prevents progress.



I taught writing and told myself for years that I wasn�t good at it. But as my school implemented new professional development, I found that I actually was. I canceled the old soundtrack that had played in my mind and adopted a new mindset.



I noticed that many students felt like they weren�t good at math or writing, but when we spent time in small groups or one-on-one and found the right supports, they discovered that they were better than they thought�and adjusted their soundtracks, too.�

2. How to Work With (Almost) Anyone: Five Questions for Building the Best Possible Relationships, by Michael Bungay Stanier



Takeaway quote: �Humans are creatures of patterns and habits, and when we name something, it tells us how to navigate it.�



In teaching, we don�t pick our groups. We�re given students, grade level, and� content teams. This book helps us build positive working relationships�including improving those that are already strong.



It includes specific tools for engaging in hard conversations in respectful, productive ways and helped me expand my communication skills. I learned that I own as much of a relationship as the other person�and how to express needs, clear misconceptions, and respect those with whom I disagree.�



Great relationships don�t just happen by chance; they take intentional work�work that students benefit from witnessing and considering, too.



3. Show Your Work! 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered, by Austin Kleon



Takeaway quote: �If you want to be accepted by a community, you have to first be a good citizen of that community.�



This book provides tools to help you put yourself and your work out into the world, to honor your comfort zone yet �show your work.�



Social media platforms�connecting with other educators�can be crucial in professional development. If you give the gift of time to other educators by letting them in on your professional process, you pay into a network and benefit, too.



Doing so has boosted my professional learning. Reading Soundtracks (above) and Show Your Work helped me realize that I have work worth sharing. I now post resources for other educators online�ones I�ve had success with in my classroom�and benefit from teachers who do the same.�



4. Life in Five Senses: How Exploring the Senses Got Me Out of My Head and Into the World, by Gretchen Rubin



Takeaway quote: �Because I noticed more, I appreciated more.�



Teachers and school leaders work in stimulating spaces, but even in busy environments, we can still feel disconnected. Education can be daunting, and negativity can pull us in.�



When I read this book, I challenged myself to focus on my five senses. I noticed images and sounds I�d ignored: a student yelling �I got it!� or �This is the best day ever!�; the faces of students who felt seen and heard; images I passed every week but hadn�t noticed; student work lining the halls.



This type of awareness was not a form of toxic positivity but a focus on realities right in front of me that helped to balance my days.�



5. You Need a Manifesto: How to Craft Your Convictions and Put Them to Work, by Charlotte Burgess-Auburn



Takeaway quote: �Defining your manifesto will give you a clear understanding and crisp articulation of the goals you�re moving toward, the values that drive you, and the ethics that govern the boundaries of your work.�



In education, we talk a lot about the �why.� But how do you break down the why? How do you set criteria for yourself so that when requests come for your time, you know when to say yes and when to say no?��



My manifesto, inspired by this text, states: �Lead with a coaching approach.� With this statement, as I begin conversations with teachers and students, I rely on questions and listening. This approach has led to collaboration and great discussion about thinking and learning�instead of merely advice-giving. My manifesto helps me say no to things that don�t fit within my why, helping me feel tuned in to my work.�



At its core, this book reminds me�and can remind us all�to put language to beliefs and values, to craft them with specific words.



6. Design for Belonging: How to Build Inclusion and Collaboration in Your Communities, by Susie Wise



Takeaway quote: �When people feel like they belong, they are able to be their best and do their best.�



Whether a teacher or administrator, we can create spaces where others feel belonging. This text helps us learn ways to see those we�re teaching and leading so they can perform at their highest potential.�



My classroom and professional learning groups include students and adults who want to be seen, heard, and supported. This book reminds me to design activities for everyone�not just the middle. I now incorporate extensions as well as scaffolds. I plan for introverts and extroverts, making sure there are spaces to share quietly and out loud�including intentional check-ins that support differentiation.�



Reading this book inspired me to switch from asking, �How are you?� to asking, �How are you feeling as part of this class?� This reframing opens conversations I might otherwise miss, helping me to build belonging.�



Widening Horizons



Reading beyond educational titles has helped me grow as a professional. I can learn instructional tools, but without these other aspects, I won�t be the educator that others deserve.



I�ve focused in, revised my why, designed a structure that I work best in, and learned tools for working with many personalities. I challenge you to read these titles and more, to be the best all-around educator and person you can be."

A rising tide of teenage mental health issues sent researchers scurrying for answers, and the sudden ascendance of AI posed a new threat to codes of academic conduct and caused some educators to forecast the end of teaching as we know it (we�re here to dispel that myth).
There was plenty of good news in the mix�and fascinating news, too. Neuroscientists continued to push the envelope on mapping the human brain, using cutting-edge technology to get a sneak peek at the �brain synchrony� between students and teachers as they learn about complex topics, and a comprehensive review of social and emotional learning confirmed, once again, that there�s no substitute for caring, welcoming school environments.

Finally, we did our due diligence and unearthed classroom strategies that can make a big difference for students, from the use of math picture books to a better, more humane way to incorporate tests and games of knowledge into your classroom activities.

1. AI MAY CUT AN EDUCATOR�S PLANNING TIME DRAMATICALLY



In case anyone thought the jury was still out on the Turing test, which proposes a hypothetical threshold at which humans and machines respond indistinguishably to a prompt�more evidence recently came in, and it�s becoming increasingly difficult to tell who�s testing who.



Researchers from the University of North Carolina set a �deep neural� AI model to work on a college-level anatomy and physiology textbook, after first training the software to recognize important information. The AI took stock, pondered in its fashion, and then dutifully produced 2,191 test questions tied to learning standards, which a panel of teachers judged to be �on par with human-generated questions in terms of their relevance to the learning objectives.� Remarkably, the instructors also said they�d consider adopting the machine-generated questions for their courses.



That�s spooky, but not without its silver linings. Test creation is time-consuming for teachers, and one knowledgeable educator who took AI for a test drive says that it performs well on other tasks like planning lessons, writing instructions, and even composing emails to parents. New AI-powered tools like Diffit, Curipod, and MagicSchool.ai, meanwhile, are starting to sound like revolutionary teaching aids.



Concern that the end of human teaching is one software release away is premature: Studies we�ve reviewed suggest that AI still requires a lot of fine-tuning, and in July of 2023, researchers concluded that without human intervention, AI is atrocious at mathematics, performing poorly on open-ended problems and routinely flubbing even simple math calculations. To be useful, it turns out, AI may need us more than we need it.



2. A FASCINATING GUIDE TO BETTER QUIZZING



No one likes tests�except the three authors of a 2023 study, apparently. The trio, who have experience as teachers and researchers, sing the praises of virtually every kind of test, quiz, and knowledge game, asserting that such assessments should be frequent, low-stakes, highly engaging, and even communal. Their rationale: When properly designed and stripped of dread, tests and quizzes dramatically improve �long-term retention and the creation of more robust retrieval routes for future access,� a well-established phenomenon known as the testing effect.



The study is a fascinating, granular look at the mechanics of testing and its impacts on learning. Here are some of the highlights:



Mix it up: To maximize student engagement, quiz students frequently�but don�t let the format get stale. In their analysis, the authors endorse testing formats as varied as multiple choice, cued-recall tests, clickers, fill-in-the-blank, short answer, and contests of knowledge.



Be competitive: When designing multiple-choice or true-false tests, opt for �competitive alternatives� in your answers. For example, when asking �What is the hottest terrestrial planet?,� proffer Venus, Mars, and Mercury instead of Venus, Uranus, and Saturn�because �Uranus and Saturn aren�t terrestrial planets.� Competitive alternatives require students to scrutinize all options, the authors hypothesize, leading them to retrieve and consider more learned material.



Pretest: Quizzing students on material they haven�t yet learned improves long-term performance �even if [students] are not able to answer any of those questions correctly,� according to the researchers. Notably, pretesting can also lead to �a reduction in mind wandering� during subsequent lessons.



Get communal: Asking students to take tests in groups can improve retention and motivation while reducing anxiety. Consider focusing on specific rather than open-ended questions, the authors caution, since students can sometimes �recall and remember information less accurately� when working together.



Pass it on: Teach students to self-test by �summarizing the main points from a lecture� without looking at any notes,� or by meeting in �small study groups where the students practice testing one another�an activity that many students already report doing.�



3. HOW TONE OF VOICE CHANGES CLASSROOM CULTURE



Like the proverbial canary in the coal mine, subtle shifts in a teacher�s tone of voice�a sharp rise in volume or a sudden barrage of repeated instructions born of frustration�can be the first sign that something�s awry in the classroom, disturbing a fragile equilibrium and leading students to clam up or act out, a study published late in 2022 suggests.



Researchers observed as teens and preteens listened to instructions given by teachers��I�m waiting for people to quiet down� or �It�s time to tidy up all of your belongings,� for example�delivered in warm, neutral, or controlling tones. While the effect was unintended, an authoritative tone often came off as confrontational, undermining students� sense of competence and discouraging them from confiding in teachers. Warm, supportive tones, on the other hand, contributed to a classroom environment that reinforced learning across multiple social and academic dimensions like sense of belonging, autonomy, and enjoyment of the class.�



It takes years to find the right tonal balance, says experienced middle school teacher Kristine Napper. �Neither high expectations nor kind hearts can do the job alone,� she coaches. Instead, teachers should strive for a warm, supportive tone and then draw on that �wellspring of trust to hold students to high standards of deep engagement with course content.�



4. BRAINS THAT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER



In 2021, we reported that as students progressed through a computer science course, the learning material left neural fingerprints that mirrored brain activity in other students, the teacher, and experts in the field. �Students who failed to grasp the material,� we wrote, �exhibited neural signatures that were outliers; they were drifting.� But the brain patterns of students who performed well on a later test aligned strongly with other top performing students�and with the teacher and experts, too.



Intriguingly, even abstract concepts�those that lack any physical attributes�appeared to trigger similar mental representations in students� minds, attesting to the remarkable cognitive flexibility underlying human communication and knowledge sharing.



A 2023 study using electroencephalography (EEG) largely confirms those findings. High school science teachers taught groups of young adults fitted with electrodes about science topics such as bipedalism, habitats, and lipids. Researchers found that stronger �brain synchrony� between peers�and between students and teachers�predicted better academic performance on follow-up tests, both immediately and a full week later.



Together, these studies underscore the importance of scholarly expertise and direct instruction, but also hint at the downstream power of peer-to-peer and social learning. As knowledge passes from teachers to learners to greater and lesser degrees�some students grasp material quickly, others more slowly�an opportunity to distribute the work of learning emerges. When advanced students are paired with struggling peers, assisted by nudges from the teacher, groups of students might eventually converge around an accurate, common understanding of the material.



5. IN SUM, MATH PICTURE BOOKS WORK



The old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words�and two are worth two thousand�might be expressed, mathematically, as a simple multiplication formula. But can reading math picture books really multiply learning?



A 2023 review of 16 studies concluded that math books like Are We There Yet, Daddy? and Sir Cumference and the Dragon of Pi improved student engagement and attitudes toward math; strengthened kids� grasp of math representations like graphs or physical models; and boosted performance on tasks like counting to 20, understanding place value, and calculating diameters. In early childhood, in particular, math picture books worked wonders�one study found that young students �tend to anticipate and guess what will happen next, resulting in high engagement, aroused interest in understanding the problems, and curiosity in finding solutions��but even middle school students seemed mesmerized by math read-alouds.



Importantly, math picture books weren�t a substitute for procedural fluency or mathematical practice. Typically, the authors noted, teachers bracketed math units with picture books, introducing a mathematical concept �in order to prepare [students] for the upcoming practice and activities,� or, alternatively, used them to review material at the end of the lesson.



6. TO IMPROVE STUDENT WRITING, REDUCE FEEDBACK (AND PUT THE ONUS ON KIDS)



It�s hard to move the needle on student writing. Hours of close reading followed by the addition of dozens of edifying margin notes can swallow teacher weekends whole, but there�s no guarantee students know how to use the feedback productively.



In fact, without guidance, revisions tend to be superficial, a new study suggests�students might correct typos and grammatical mistakes, for example, or make cursory adjustments to a few ideas, but leave it at that. A promising, time-saving alternative is to deploy rubrics, mentor texts, and other clarifying writing guidelines.



In the study, high school students were graded on the clarity, sophistication, and thoroughness of their essays before being split into groups to test the effectiveness of various revision strategies. Students who consulted rubrics that spelled out the elements of an excellent essay�a clear central thesis, support for the claim, and cohesive overall structure, for example�improved their performance by a half-letter grade while kids who read mentor texts boosted scores by a third of a letter grade.



Rubrics and mentor texts are reusable, �increase teachers� efficient use of time,� and �enhance self-feedback� in a way that can lead to better, more confident writers down the line, the new research suggests.



7. A NEW THEORY ABOUT THE TEEN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS



Parents, teachers, and medical professionals are wringing their hands over the alarming, decades-long rise in teenage mental health issues, including depression, feelings of �persistent hopelessness,� and drug addiction.



The root causes remain elusive�cell phones and social media are prime suspects�but a sprawling 2023 study offers another explanation that�s gaining traction: After scouring surveys, data sets, and cultural artifacts, researchers theorized that a primary cause is �a decline over decades in opportunities for children and teens to play, roam, and engage in other activities independent of direct oversight and control by adults.�



Scholarly reviews of historical articles, books, and advice columns on child rearing depict an era when young children �walked or biked to school alone,� and contributed to their �family�s well being� and �community life� through meaningful chores and jobs. If that all feels vaguely mythical, data collected over the last 50 years reveals a correlation: frank admissions by parents that their children play outdoors independently less than they did, and significant drops in the number of kids who walk, bike, or bus to school alone or are allowed to cross busy roads by themselves. In the U.S., for example, a government survey showed that 48 percent of K�8 students walked to school in 1969, but by 2009 only 13 percent did. 



Risky play and unsupervised outdoor activities, meanwhile, which might �protect against the development of phobias� and reduce �future anxiety by increasing the person�s confidence that they can deal effectively with emergencies,� are often frowned upon. That last point is crucial, because dozens of studies suggest that happiness in childhood, and then later in adolescence, is driven by internal feelings of �autonomy, competence, and relatedness��and independent play, purposeful work, and important roles in classrooms and families are vital, early forms of practice.



Whatever the causes, young children seem to sense that something�s off. In one 2017 study, kindergartners who viewed images of fun activities routinely struck pictures that included adults from the category of play, rejecting the role of grown-ups in a domain they clearly saw as their own.



8. DIRECT INSTRUCTION AND INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING ARE COMPLEMENTARY



It�s an often-fiery but ultimately dubious debate: Should teachers employ direct instruction, or opt for inquiry-based learning?



At its core, direct instruction often conveys information �by lecturing and by giving a leading role to the teacher,� researchers explain in a 2023 study examining the evidence supporting both approaches. Critics typically focus solely on its passive qualities, a straw-man argument that ignores activities such as note-taking, practice quizzes, and classroom discussions. Opponents of inquiry-based learning, meanwhile, characterize it as chaotic, akin to sending students on a wild goose chase and asking them to discover the laws of physics on their own�though it can actually unlock �deep learning processes such as elaboration, self-explanation, and metacognitive strategies,� the researchers say.



Both sides misrepresent what teachers actually do in classrooms. Instructional models are �often combined in practice,� the researchers note, and inquiry-based learning is usually supported with direct instruction. Teachers might begin a lesson by leading a review of key concepts, for example, and then ask students to apply what they�re learning in unfamiliar contexts.�



Let the debate rage on. Teachers already know that factual fluency and the need to struggle, flail, and even hit dead-ends are integral to learning. Teaching is fluid and complex and spools out in real time; it resists every effort to reduce it to a single strategy or program that works for all kids, in all contexts.



9. A TRULY MASSIVE REVIEW FINDS VALUE IN SEL�AGAIN



It�s d�j� vu all over again. The researcher Joseph Durlak, who put social and emotional learning on the map with his 2011 study that concluded that SEL programs boosted academic performance by an impressive 11 percentile points, was back at it in 2023�working with an ambitious new team, led by Yale professor Christina Cipriano, on a similar mission.



The group just published a comprehensive meta-analysis that surveyed a whopping 424 studies involving over half a million K�12 students, scrutinizing school-based SEL programs and strategies such as mindfulness, interpersonal skills, classroom management, and emotional intelligence. The findings: Students who participated in such programs experienced �improved academic achievement, school climate, school functioning, social emotional skills, attitudes, and prosocial and civic behaviors,� the researchers concluded.



Intriguingly, SEL remained a powerful driver of better cultures and student outcomes into the middle and high school years, a reminder that there�s no cutoff point for building relationships, teaching empathy, and making schools inclusive and welcoming.



While politicians continue to stoke controversy on the topic, there�s actually widespread support for SEL, as long as it�s connected to better academic outcomes. A 2021 Thomas B. Fordham Institute survey revealed that parents reacted negatively to classroom instruction labeled �social and emotional learning,� but were favorably disposed when a single clause was added�calling it �social-emotional & academic learning� turned the tide and secured parental buy-in.



10. MORE EVIDENCE FOR MOVING PAST �FINDING THE MAIN IDEA�



In the United States, the teaching of reading comprehension has ping-ponged between skills-based and knowledge-based approaches. In 2019, things appeared to come to a head: While reading programs continued to emphasize transferable skills like �finding the main idea� or �making inferences,� the author Natalie Wexler published The Knowledge Gap, an influential takedown of skills-based methods, and a large 2020 study from the Thomas B. Fordham Institute concurred, noting that �exposing kids to rich content in civics, history, and law� taught reading more effectively than skills-based approaches.



Now a pair of new, high-quality studies�featuring leading researchers and encompassing more than 5,000 students in 39 schools�appears to put the finishing touches on a decades-long effort to push background knowledge to the forefront of reading instruction.



In a Harvard study, 3,000 elementary students participated in a yearlong literacy program focused on the �knowledge rich� domains of social studies and science, exploring the methods used to study past events, for example, or investigating how animals evolve to survive in different habitats. Compared to their counterparts in business-as-usual classes, the �knowledge based� readers scored 18 percent higher on general reading comprehension. Background knowledge acts like a scaffold, the researchers explained, helping students �connect new learning to a general schema and transfer their knowledge to related topics.�In the other study, a team of researchers, including leading experts David Grissmer, Daniel Willingham, and Chris Hulleman, examined the impact of the �Core Knowledge� program on 2,310 students in nine lottery-based Colorado charter schools from kindergarten to sixth grade. The approach improved reading scores by 16 percentile points, and if implemented nationally, the researchers calculated, might catapult U.S. students from 15th to fifth place on international reading tests.



The pendulum is swinging, but the researchers caution against overreach: There appear to be �two separate but complementary cognitive processes involved in development and learning: �skill building� and �knowledge accumulation,�� they clarified. We may have the balance out of whack, but to develop proficient readers, you need both."

This incredible experience was made possible through the Grosvenor Teacher Fellowship, a partnership between Lindblad Expeditions and the National Geographic Society.��



Teamed with two other teachers�Caroline Little, a middle school science teacher from St. Paul, Minnesota, and Karina New, a fifth-and-sixth-grade teacher from Vancouver, Canada�I embraced an unparalleled professional development opportunity. My central focus revolved around leveraging educational technology, particularly virtual reality (VR) and coding, to elevate student-centered instruction, and I�m excited to share the insights and discoveries gathered from this enriching expedition below.



A Meaningful Immersion



For three weeks, my colleagues and I were ambassadors aboard the National Geographic Explorer, collaborating and learning alongside Lindblad�s naturalists (historians, marine biologists, ornithologists, and undersea specialists), a National Geographic photographer, and an excellent staff and crew. Our aim was to immerse ourselves in firsthand experiences and gather knowledge to nurture geographic awareness and foster a global perspective within our students and community.�



My goal was to design lessons that catered to all students, whether utilizing high-tech, low-tech, or no-tech resources. To achieve this, I actively engaged in every naturalist�s presentation. Each day, one to three naturalists captivated us with their storytelling, unveiling their diverse specialties and viewpoints. Their insights sparked ideas that I eagerly jotted down, intending to infuse them into my teaching methods.�



A pivotal moment for me occurred during a lecture with Jasper Doest, a photographer for National Geographic. He asked us to consider the story we wanted to tell and to capture images that would make our friends and family fall in love with Antarctica, fostering care and concern. He urged us to create photos that would leave them in awe, surprise them with intimate details, and invite them along on our journey.�



Taking his words to heart, I found myself asking�before capturing each photo��What is the story I want to tell?� While close-up images of penguins, seals, and whales are adorable, I found myself zooming out to include more perspective. Antarctica�s sheer vastness often exceeded the limits of my lens, compelling me to explore different viewpoints.�



Positioning myself from a Zodiac, a type of inflatable boat, I initially focused on a pod of humpback whales as they began rounding out of the water before their dive. Then, I zoomed out, capturing our 148-passenger vessel against the ice shelf, emphasizing its colossal size in comparison with the ship and the towering mountain backdrop. My intent was to offer my students and community varied perspectives, allowing them to grasp the immense scale of Antarctica.�



During our journey to South Georgia, the scenery and perspective underwent a dramatic shift, immersing us in a thriving ecosystem bustling with life. We found ourselves amid vast colonies of penguins, numbering up to 250,000, and encountered adorable fur seal pups at every turn. Transitioning from South Georgia to the Falkland Islands, we experienced yet another striking change in our surroundings. Welcoming us were vibrant, colorful homes and a friendly town. As we approached the end of a hike on Carcass Island, amid stunning landscape views and numerous encounters with penguins and albatrosses, we encountered a large amount of marine debris that had washed ashore.�



This unfortunate sight marked our discovery of plastic pollution in Antarctica, South Georgia, and the Falkland Islands. Along with our efforts to clean up during the hike, I consciously integrated the issue of marine pollution into the lessons I was creating, making plans to discuss it with students alongside the impacts of climate change.�
Applying Travel to Teaching



After returning home, I immediately began crafting a variety of antarctic-themed technology lessons integrating VR and coding, returning to the inquiry that sparked my investigation during this immersive expedition.�



Starting with a penguin-themed VR lesson using Expeditions Pro, I tailored the content for my kindergarten and first-grade students who had already been introduced to the antarctic penguin species during their math unit. Expanding on their existing knowledge, I invited them to delve into exploring the habitats of Ad�lie, gentoo, chinstrap, king, Magellanic, rockhopper, and macaroni penguins, all while exploring the impacts of climate change and marine pollution�which impact the species.�



Next, I moved on to creating coding lessons for different age groups. For second through fourth graders, I curated high-tech lessons centered around Dash robots by Wonder Workshop. These lessons utilized the Blockly app, a drag-and-drop programming tool, and a 150 cm x 240 cm mat with 30 cm grids, synchronizing with the robot�s size and movements.�



Simultaneously, I tailored low-tech lessons for kindergarten through first graders, featuring Bee-Bots, simple directional robots. These lessons integrated a 75 cm x 75 cm mat with 15 cm grids, aligning with the smaller-scale movements of these robots. Additionally, I adapted these lessons to offer unplugged versions suitable for various gridded mat sizes, ensuring adaptability across different learning environments.



To kick off each coding lesson, students decorated their robots or game pieces to resemble their chosen penguin species and crafted icebergs and leopard seals from recycled materials. Starting in cell A1, the task involved maneuvering through the treacherous antarctic waters, evading leopard seals and icebergs, all while ensuring the safe delivery of food to their eagerly awaiting chick.�



VR, STEM, and Environmental Education



To further bring this pedagogy to life, we hosted an immersive antarctic-themed evening with VR and coding challenges and discovered that these lessons were extremely versatile, seamlessly integrating into math or science classes and media centers. Regardless of the setting, these activities foster profound engagement in cross-curricular STEM lessons. They actively promote communication, collaboration, and the cultivation of geographic awareness, fostering a global perspective among students.



While crafting immersive coding and VR experiences in Antarctica was undeniably extraordinary, the techniques and skills applied are easily replicable. When creating coding challenges, simplicity is key. Typically, I start by laying out a mat, incorporating one or two obstacles, and defining the robot�s starting and ending points. While the cross-curricular elements vary in each challenge, the foundational computer science principles remain the same.



In the realm of creating VR experiences, starting small is the way to go. For instance, if you have a unit on community helpers, bring your 360-degree camera on a road trip around your town. The audible cheers and connections made while exploring the local firehouse, library, and police station are experiences your students will truly love, leveraging the power of community for deep learning.



Note: The 2024 Grosvenor Teacher Fellowship applications are open until January 7, 2024�I encourage all pre-K through 12 educators, whether in formal or informal settings, to seriously consider applying."
Education,54,Embracing Patience in Education,https://www.edutopia.org/article/importance-patience-education,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/00030252-crop.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,15-11-23," For school administrators, it�s tempting to rush into new initiatives, but setting a slower pace offers many benefits.",The Importance of Patience in Education | Edutopia,"In our fast-paced world, where speed and instant results often steal the spotlight, there�s a quiet but profound virtue that often goes unnoticed�the courage to go slow. This is particularly relevant when we embark on the journey of developing or refining instructional strategies, especially those that are entirely unfamiliar to us. The question then is, how do we develop and sustain a new habit?



The answer may seem counterintuitive, but instead of rushing to implement, we need to slow down. We need to pay attention to the importance of patience in the process of habit formation and the significant role that educational leadership plays in modeling the value of taking it slow and steady. This journey is guided by the timeless metaphor of the tortoise and the hare.



The Habit-Formation Challenge



Impatience for quick results creeps in when we set out to establish new habits or make positive changes in our lives. We want to see dramatic shifts overnight, much like the hare in the famous fable. The research on this approach is sobering. One study found that habit formation can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to take hold.



When was the last time we allowed a professional learning community to focus slow and steady for three months on one or two strategies to improve? Barak Rosenshine shares that the degree to which teachers spend time in guided practice and checking for understanding to ensure high levels of success for students is the greatest difference between highly effective and less effective teachers. Do we take the time to focus on sustained practice in these areas? Or is it on to the next thing?



The uptake of a habit often depends on the difficulty of a new habit we are attempting to form and the current habits we have surrounding the new habit. For instance, if we are adding vegetables into our lunch versus removing meat from our diet, the time for the latter will take longer.



Akin to a minor change to our lunch, adding a new probing question into our approach for checking for understanding will likely take less time than a whole new approach to asking questions in class. Leaders can assist in this process by encouraging staff to name the degree of change when we embark on a new approach. Is this a slight adjustment or a significant move in our practice?



Additionally, leaders need to narrate the importance of leeway in habit formation. The good news about the long runway with habit formation is that this time frame for acquiring and consolidating new habits accounts for errors in the process. In other words, we can mess up every once in a while.



Habit formation is a process that requires patience and persistence. It�s about the gradual accumulation of small victories that eventually lead to significant changes. So how do we go slow and steady?
The Power of Leadership



Educational leaders play a pivotal role in setting the tone for how staff approaches new habit formation.



Leaders who emphasize and model the importance of patience in learning something new, consistency in the routine of new practices, and the appreciation and respect of forgetting or messing up a new practice create a space where staff feel supported and encouraged to start and progress toward a new habit. Educational leaders can use the following strategies to ensure that their staff is on the right path:



Lead by example: Leaders who embody patience and persistence set a powerful example for their teams. When leaders take the time to develop their own habits deliberately and publicly, they demonstrate that success is not about rushing but about steady progress. This means they name the degree of change, discuss when they forgot or created errors, and share how they have stayed small and focused over a series of weeks.



Foster degree changes: Educational leaders who encourage getting better at current practices illustrate that not everything is about starting something brand-new, but rather can be about improvement. As Rosenshine shared, the difference between the most effective teachers and the less effective teachers is about the degree to which they implement and inspect particular, well-known practices. 



When educational leaders say that they are refining their practice, they demonstrate this aspect of habit development (e.g., improving their use of protocols to elicit more feedback from staff).



Provide support: Leaders who champion the importance of going slow but starting offer support and guidance to those under their leadership by modeling, providing time, and checking in with individuals and teams on progress. They recognize that everyone has their own pace and tailor their approach accordingly, fostering an environment where individuals feel valued and motivated.



The Tortoise�s Lesson: Patience in Practice



To truly embrace the courage to go slow in habit development, consider the following steps.



1. Start, shelter, and subtract habits. Understand that habit formation takes time and requires testing, reflecting, and adapting. Set systems that focus you and your team and organization on the implementation and impact on a few key practices. Make sure to protect those few practices by eliminating other initiatives or practices.



2. Push consistency over intensity. Focus on maintaining consistent effort rather than pushing for rapid, unsustainable changes. It�s the slow and steady progress that leads to lasting habits. This occurs because the enduring habits that are selected are implemented every day and reflected upon routinely.



3. Embrace small wins. Celebrate each small victory along the way. These moments of success, no matter how minor, are the building blocks of lasting change.



4. Seek support. Surround yourself with individuals who support your journey and value the importance of patience. Lean on their encouragement during challenging times.



The Strength in Going Slow



In a world that often glorifies speed, it takes courage to embrace the wisdom of going slow. As we develop habits, patience becomes our greatest ally. Leadership that models the significance of taking it slow and steady further empowers individuals to navigate this journey with resilience and determination."
Education,55,Tapping Into the 5 Senses to Support Students With Disabilities,https://www.edutopia.org/article/incorporating-five-senses-classroom,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/K81REP-crop.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,13-11-23,Activities that draw upon the five senses�such as spending time outdoors�can be centering for students in special education.,Incorporating the Five Senses Into the Classroom | Edutopia,"Our ability to smell, taste, hear, touch, and see plays an essential part in our everyday lives. These senses help us interpret thoughts and feelings about our surrounding environment and contribute to well-being. In the classroom, when students understand how to address each sense, they are more aware of what�s happening around them and within their body and mind.



Teachers who recognize the benefits of incorporating the five senses into the classroom can provide students with more than just awareness of their surroundings�they can also help support students� mental health. As a teacher in a special education high school classroom, I have found that incorporating the five senses helps my students relieve anxiety and enhances their ability to focus and maintain attention.



8 Strategies to Incorporate the Senses Into Your Classroom



1. Bring it all together. The 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 coping technique is designed to decrease anxiety and support overwhelming thoughts and actions. It can be used before, in the middle of, or at the end of class. Ask students to do the following:



Acknowledge five things you see around you.

Acknowledge four things you can touch around you.

Acknowledge three things you can hear.

Acknowledge two things you can smell.

Acknowledge one thing you can taste.



2. Create a sensory workspace. This offers a self-soothing space for students to be effective and focused. The strategy begins by giving students the option of having a sensory item of their choice at their desks. Their selection can be based on the activity or assignment. For example, if students are reading silently, they could take out a stuffed animal to squeeze; or if they are taking a quiz, it might be helpful to have a bottle of water on their desk to stay hydrated.



3. Provide sensory questions of the day. Create an opportunity for students to answer a question of the day about a specific sense. This strategy allows students to share their senses, which brings them comfort, joy, and connection to calm:



What is your favorite smell, and how does it make you feel?

What is the best-tasting beverage? When you drink it, what does it do to your attitude?

If you could touch anything that brings you happiness, what would it be? Why?

The best sound in the world is _____ because it allows me to _____.

What view brings you happiness?
4. Have students complete a weekly or daily senses journal. Through this strategy, students keep track of their senses, their experiences, and how the senses make them feel. The sense can be something from the weekend or throughout their day that they notice.



For example, a student once wrote about a restaurant he had gone to over the weekend. In his journal, he described the smell of the restaurant, the taste of the burger he ate, and the great music being played at dinner. This memory elicited positive feelings and offered a relaxing thought for this student. I could tell that this reflection put him in a positive mood. Keeping a journal allows students to check in with a motivating thought to focus or relieve anxiety when needed.



5. Smile. The mindful smile strategy can be mood-changing! Smiling can increase your mood along with others around you. The sight of a smile directed to each student as they walk through the door, when asking a question, and even when making corrective remarks to your students can put them in a less anxious state of mind. Research has shown that smiling can relieve stress and anxiety and make for a healthier lifestyle.



6. Incorporate music. Numerous studies have shown that listening to music is associated with lower levels of stress and boredom and improved concentration, which is why many people stream music while exercising, working, and studying. The types of music that motivate people are largely individual. Ambient sounds, instrumentals, and lo-fi music can all find a place in the best playlists for focus and memory.



Have students create a playlist on a note card with six songs that elicit a feeling of motivation, focus, and relaxation. Students can choose two songs for each category. Throughout the year, play the songs at particular points in the class.



7. Step outdoors. The time-to-get-away strategy involves someone stepping outside for some fresh air. When students feel anxious, stressed, or overwhelmed, provide them an opportunity to step outside for a moment. Moreover, offer that students can take a calming prop such as a pen, mug, stuffed animal, or stress ball with them. The item should be designed to help boost calm, focus, or de-escalation.



Sometimes if an outside door is not close by, students can open a window or take a walk in the hallway. If you have a small classroom and find that all students can benefit from this strategy�such as before a test, presentation, or group activity�take everyone for a short getaway.



8. Have your students take a mental sensory vacation. In this strategy, students design their mental vacation where anxiety, stress, and worries can be put to the side. Instead, they create a place in their minds where calm, relaxation, and self-control take over. When you find that students are overstimulated or in need of guidance to reset and focus, send them to their sensory vacation spot. This strategy is best when guided by the teacher in this way:



Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a relaxing place. It could be anyplace. However, it should be a place that brings you no stress, no anxiety, and no negativity. Take 10 seconds to think about where you are. Take 10 seconds to think about what you see. Take 10 seconds to think about what you hear. Take 10 seconds to think about what you smell. Take 10 seconds to think about what you taste. Take 10 seconds to think about what you feel. Keep your eyes closed, and take 30 seconds to think about everything you see. Now, open your eyes. How do you feel?"
Education,56,How to Support Twice-Exceptional Students,https://www.edutopia.org/article/how-support-twice-exceptional-students,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hero_blog_Student-Engagement_illustration_iStock_968151038_JakeOlimb.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,09-11-23,Common pedagogical practices that benefit all students may be crucial for those who are cognitively gifted and have a form of neurodivergence.,How to Support Twice-Exceptional Students | Edutopia,"Twice-exceptional (2e) students are students who are cognitively gifted and have some type of neurodivergence, such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dysgraphia, or dyscalculia. We don�t know exactly how many twice-exceptional students are out there�they�re believed to be considerably under-identified�but there�s a good chance that many of us have worked, or will work, with students who have this unique learning profile.�



Yet, many schools don�t understand 2e students�their particular strengths and challenges, how to best stretch and support them. In my own experience as an educator who taught for over 14 years, I hadn�t even heard the term �twice-exceptional� until our son was identified as such.



A Challenge for Both Parents and Teachers



To parents of twice-exceptional kids, our son�s story is familiar. From a very young age he was incredibly bright and creative, but it didn�t take long for problems to emerge at school: in his case, emotional dysregulation�a common issue with 2e kids. Thankfully, we were able to have our son tested via neuropsychological evaluation, which confirmed his giftedness and also diagnosed his ADHD. His ADHD was surprising to us. But as we soon learned, with 2e students, giftedness and neurodivergence often mask each other, which is one of the reasons why it�s difficult to identify 2e students.



Thanks to the neuropsych evaluation, we also learned that the behavioral issues that had been cropping up at home and at school were rooted in anxiety. As Dr. Michael Postma writes in ADDitude magazine, for 2e students, �emotions are more intense because the limbic system, the part of the brain thought to be responsible for emotion and other processes, is overloaded by increased sensory input.� For many 2e students, this overload of sensory input results in anxiety, and anxiety often manifests as emotional dysregulation.



The challenges didn�t stop there. We quickly realized that our son�s classroom teachers, specialists, and administrators weren�t able to provide the support he needed. Like me, most of them hadn�t even heard the term �twice-exceptional� before, much less learned strategies for accommodating students like him. For a variety of reasons, not the least of which was this, our family decided to move. Now our son attends a school that is able to create a nurturing environment for all students, neurotypical and neurodivergent. We consider ourselves very lucky.



But families of 2e students shouldn�t have to move or change schools in order to find learning communities that embrace their children. Every school should strive to create classroom environments that fit the needs of 2e students. After all, 2e students are everywhere, and the strategies that they need to fully participate in school benefit most other students as well.�



It�s also important to note that 2e students bring great strengths to any classroom of which they are a part. As Emily Kircher-Morris, LPC, notes in her book Raising Twice-Exceptional Children: A Handbook for Parents of Neurodivergent Gifted Kids, 2e students are gifted with a quick learning pace, strong verbal abilities, strong logic and reasoning skills, divergent thinking skills, and big-picture thinking. As our son�s neuropsychologist told us�and our son�twice-exceptional kids often become adults who change the world.�



If teachers and school administrators were to become aware of 2e and engage in conversations with parents or caregivers of students who may be cognitively gifted and/or neurodivergent, they could consider recommending neuropsychological evaluation. Taking these steps would be a move in the right direction.



But until the world of K�12 education better understands and supports 2e students, I�ve learned that I�m going to have to fiercely advocate for my son and others like him. Accordingly, I�d like to share some pedagogical approaches that are crucial for 2e students but also support other students in the classroom.

What educators can do



Prioritize student choice: 2e students often have a much more difficult time focusing on topics and tasks that don�t interest them. When they�re provided with opportunities to study topics about which they are naturally curious�or to show their knowledge in ways that they find engaging�these students are much more likely to fully engage.�



Strive for a 4:1 ratio of praise to redirection: Because of their area(s) of disability, 2e students are often quite accustomed to criticism from adults. Not only that, but these students are usually well aware of their deficiencies and extremely frustrated with themselves for not being able to measure up. A 4:1 ratio of genuine praise to direction can help build much-needed confidence in 2e students while also showing them that you see them as worthy of praise.



Build movement breaks into the school day: In many schools, students don�t have enough opportunities to move around, and 2e students require movement breaks in order to recenter themselves, relieve stress, and improve focus. Depending on grade level, movement breaks will look different in terms of type and frequency, but the important part is making sure they are built into each school day.



Differentiate as often as possible: 2e students have both exceptional strengths and exceptional challenges (a combination often described as �asynchronous development�). There�s a pronounced discrepancy between their strengths and their weaknesses, as well as between their abilities and what they achieve. So when educators truly differentiate their instruction, they help 2e students build on strengths and develop areas of weakness so that the gap between their abilities and achievement becomes smaller.�



Explicitly teach SEL skills: Social and emotional learning is a high priority for 2e students because it�s an area that�s often quite challenging for them. The more that educators explicitly teach 2e students a vocabulary for their emotions and practical ways to self-regulate, the better able 2e students are to understand, and eventually control, their intense emotions. And when 2e students are better able to control their emotions, they are able to more fully participate at school.�



Build perseverance: Because of their giftedness, 2e students aren�t usually pushed to the edge of their understanding. So when they do find themselves at the edge, they become anxious. Explicitly teaching a growth mindset helps 2e students understand that new skills can be developed over time. Praising even the smallest of successes during the learning process can make a big impact for these students over time.�



Each of these pedagogical approaches is usually considered a hallmark of good teaching. But the important distinction here is that for 2e students, they�re not just helpful�they�re essential. When we create school communities that accommodate 2e students, we help them become the best versions of themselves. And that�s truly a gift that will keep on giving."
Education,57,The Benefits of a Written Curriculum for Physical Education and School Sports,https://www.edutopia.org/article/sel-focus-within-sports-pe,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hero_blog_physical-education_high-school_photo_iStock_1432175884_simonkr.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,05-10-23,A curriculum with elements of social and emotional learning helps kids develop good relationships with teammates and perform better.,An SEL Focus Within Sports and PE | Edutopia,"School sports are widely recognized as having a positive developmental influence on children. Not only do those students get exercise, have a chance to make new friends, and learn about teamwork, but also they improve their self-confidence as they achieve their goals.



These benefits are often learned implicitly, meaning that children may learn, but it�s without intentionality. While there is explicit instruction regarding sport-specific physical skills, such as where to place your body when you set a pick in basketball, there may be no such corresponding explicit teaching on how to focus or create a positive environment where people learn faster and perform better.



Good coaches may impart this information, but they might not think of it as social and emotional learning (SEL). A focus on SEL within sports and physical education (PE) could give coaches another tool to get the best out of their young athletes.



Aligning our thinking with the Science of Learning and Development (SoLD), pioneered by Richard Lerner, Linda Darling-Hammond, Pamela Cantor, and David Osher, we submit that athletics is exactly the kind of integrated program that can foster learning in activities that address the whole child.



However, unlike other classroom subjects, sports does not have a written curriculum to guide PE teachers and coaches on how to teach those life lessons. While there is some systematic integration of SEL into PE, it�s still far from standard practice.

Written Curriculum Advantages



If what we know about how to achieve in sport and elsewhere through acquiring certain social and emotional skills and mental habits were put into a written curriculum that PE teachers and coaches could use with students both school- and district-wide, it could have dramatic effects.



Students entering teams would have a fundamental skill set from their PE experiences. For coaches, being systematic about SEL would raise their athletes to a higher level and provide a consistency of message on all teams, stabilize team environments, and provide guidelines as to what social and emotional skills could be explicitly expected, taught, and reinforced.



Of the many values of the written word, one is that it lends gravitas and a permanency to whatever the subject is being addressed. In school sports, a written curriculum would allow a sense of community to emerge around shared goals, show sport as an agent for social inclusivity, and allow us to envision sports as a transformative and educational resource.



At the high school level in particular, building blocks exist for a written curriculum that can promote a positive team climate and help PE teachers and coaches broaden their relationships with their students/athletes beyond the mechanics of particular sports and activities.



4 Ways PE Teachers and Coaches Can Advance SEL



1. Promote a positive team climate and essential virtues. Sport psychology and SEL show that teams and individuals who value safe, supportive, encouraging, and inclusive team climates perform better and learn faster. Having a positive team climate includes athletes possessing the psychological safety that allows them to be more collaborative and creative without fear.



Creating a positive, safe, and supportive space is a skill. Many companies in the business community follow this science and have applied the same approach in their operational practices. Codifying these practices in the PE and youth sports context would, if truly implemented, increase the social and emotional benefits that students would get from participation and mitigate much of the abuse that plagues youth sports.



2. Develop skills through thought recognition and relationship building. When adolescents are intentionally taught emotion regulation and focus skills, they are helped when shooting a foul shot with 0.1 seconds left on the clock. Learning how to problem-solve and learning how to make decisions are valuable skills when analyzing one�s own performance and looking to make improvements. Empathy and communication are essential when picking up your teammate when they miss a catch. Knowing and identifying these skills is the first step in having them take root within students� and athletes� lives.



Intentionally teaching and practicing metacognition would allow anticipatory defensive players to pierce the passing lane, to find calm through meditation in the middle of a chaotic game, to recognize distracting thoughts in real time to improve concentration. Students who are trained in thinking about what they are thinking about are more likely to be the best version of themselves in any athletic contest.



3. Build student investment and responsibility through student voice. In 21st-century businesses, employee voice is valued because it increases their engagement and empowerment to ask questions, seek help, and try out new skills while providing valuable feedback, decreasing stress, and increasing morale. The employees feel ownership in the business because they contributed to its success.



This same concept applies in athletic activities and sports teams and for the same reasons. Have the participants set the group/team values, rules, and consequences for infractions; let them plan practice and develop game plans; and give them opportunities to provide honest feedback and suggest improvements. This improves autonomy and engagement.



4. Have the coach serve as a facilitator. Of course, for the above to happen, PE teachers and coaches must take on the role of guiding facilitator, mostly by asking pertinent questions of players and giving them the freedom to offer their answers without fear of being judged harshly. Ideally, it means establishing a written problem-solving protocol that is used regularly when difficulties or challenges exist�whether in a PE class or a game context, in preparation as well as in action.



This requires the coach to give up some power, but certainly not during games where split-second decisions must be made by only one person. When students are aware of this new role embraced by their coaches, their relationship changes, and students� accountability and responsibilities are increased.



Teachers and coaches truly are guides, helping students get to a range of destinations, some expected, some not, in a systematic way. A written curriculum provides a map that allows many to follow it, not just those gifted with a good sense of direction. As Nelson Mandela observed, sport �speaks to youth in a language they understand.� Let�s start a true conversation."
Education,58,A Multimedia Approach to Place-Based Education,https://www.edutopia.org/article/multimedia-approach-place-based-education,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iStock-660566420-crop-1.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,29-09-23,"By identifying and documenting important places and spaces at school, students become stewards of their learning environment.",A Multimedia Approach Place-Based Education | Edutopia,"Purposefully connecting students to their school communities not only cultivates a sense of belonging; it also enhances academic learning.�

Place-based education (PBE) aims to do just that�immerse students in their local communities and environments to leverage authentic experiences, deeper learning, and connection to community. And by merging PBE with innovative multimedia to facilitate dynamic learning, we can drive student motivation even more.�

Pairing Place-Based Education with Photovoice

When PBE is paired with Photovoice�a research method that involves attaching language/writing to images to describe places and spaces�students gain a platform for expressing their school and community experiences.�



There is a synergistic relationship between PBE and Photovoice: Both approaches engage participants with their environment, foster connections that extend beyond the classroom, and facilitate experiential learning. Both approaches also evoke learning across content areas, bringing forth students� unique perspectives and strengthening digital literacy.
The �Sharing Our Place� Project



In a Virginia Beach elementary school, I put this approach into action by developing the �Sharing Our Place� photography and book-making project, which has now spanned three years. It has become an interdisciplinary process that has led students to explore their own place and voice within their learning community.



I applied for and was awarded a scholarship and two grants through my local higher education institution, Old Dominion University, and my school district, Virginia Beach City Public Schools, to accumulate materials that made this project possible: point-and-shoot cameras fitted with rechargeable batteries and 16 GB SD cards, a bookbinding machine, a subscription to the Book Creator application, and a color printer. We also used Google Drive and Chromebook photo editing apps and had one-to-one Chromebook access.�



I was a classroom teacher at the start of the project and launched it in my room; however, once I moved into an instructional technology specialist role, I recruited classes from across my school. Because the project aligns with our social studies, social and emotional learning (SEL), literacy, and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) standards, I was able to integrate the project across the instructional day. In 2022�23, this comprised two fifth-grade classes and one first-grade class and lasted for a semester.



Place-Based Education Activities and Digital Literacy



I began the project by providing students with cameras and demonstrating the basic functionalities of the devices. After some play-practice, the students identified, as a group, important places around their school community�the places that we then traversed and photographed.��



Once students� photo shoots were complete, I guided them through the process of moving their photos from the camera SD cards into folders in their Google Drives. From there, they edited their photos and pulled them into their Book Creator digital books, which synced with Google Drive. Book Creator has a plethora of content design features, and educators who set up an account can get 40 free books.



Photovoice Deepens Digital Literacy Skills�



With photos situated in the digital book templates, it was time for Photovoice. Students created captions or, for older students, more detailed descriptions of the photographed places around their school community. For younger students who were not fluent writers or typists, we used Book Creator�s speech-to-text feature and provided one-on-one writing conferences for writing and editing instruction. Fifth-grade students wrote their own text and also received writing conferences.



When it was time to print and bind the books, we included students in the process. I used the Vevor Wireless Glue Book Binding Machine. And to conclude and celebrate the project, we formed book buddy partnerships, with students involved in the project visiting K�5 classrooms to read their books about the shared community.



Curriculum Alignment for PBE and Photovoice Implementation



As noted above, this project aligns with social studies, SEL, literacy, and ISTE�s digital literacy and computer science standards (for additional info on standards alignment, please see this PDF).�



Its framework is flexible enough that facilitators can also address community needs and interests, upholding the goals and philosophies of PBE and Photovoice. Are there areas of the school that need upkeep or enhancement? Are there spaces that evoke powerful memories of learning and inclusivity? How can students become stewards of their school, inspired by their photo shoot, and then disseminate those ideas to promote positive change for their community?�



Challenges and Considerations



Implementation challenges do exist related to material and technology access. If you�re not able to attain funds to purchase materials, how else can students document their community? Does your school media center have tablets that take photos? Drawing, writing, and mapping are nondigital ways to implement the project. And binding can become as simple as stapling. Partnering with your school�s technology specialist can support and enhance teaching and learning using technology and building digital literacy.�



It�s also important to consider the ethical elements of representing communities and children. Make sure to obtain parent or guardian permission to take photographs of children. Teach children about privacy and respect by asking subjects if they want to be photographed. Be aware of children who show sensitivity to any part of the process, and allow choices and alternatives for children to participate.�



Centering Digital Literacy



A main purpose of PBE is to enhance students� connections to their communities through engaging learning experiences in the context of local environments. Student agency and voice, citizenship, and the celebration of diversity and inclusivity have been core components of this ongoing project.�



The approach has empowered students to engage with their community in ways that concurrently build digital literacy skills. In the future, I hope to focus even more deeply on ways students can create change to improve their school communities, demonstrating digital literacy and Photovoice documentation as tools for advocacy and action."
Education,59,Teaching Young Learners to Connect With Nature,https://www.edutopia.org/article/guiding-preschoolers-connect-nature,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iStock-1444698736-crop-1.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,26-09-23,Teachers can guide pre-K students to understand and appreciate nature by discussing and documenting their observations.,Guiding Preschoolers to Connect with Nature | Edutopia,"When young children spend time in natural environments, their cognitive, social and emotional, and communication skills improve. Connecting with nature expands brain development, promotes social interaction, and provides an environment conducive for imaginary play, discovery, wonder, and effortless curiosity.



As educators, we want to provide the necessary avenues that young children require to develop into happy, empathetic, kind individuals. Nature is full of awe-inspiring beauty, and we simply need to take advantage of the opportunity of exposing children to its boundless experiences. Nature provokes children into action to formulate their own ideas and self-guided investigations. When children are fully immersed and exposed to experiences with nature, they�re given an open invitation for free adventure.



Getting Started



When teachers guide young children out into nature, whether it�s a large tree-filled playground, a raised garden bed, a small grassy knoll, or a tree box on the school�s sidewalk, they become �nature detectives� searching and unearthing the unknown. 



As the lead detective, remind and connect students with their senses; ask them questions that relate to each of the five senses by asking open-ended questions:��What do you see?� �What do you smell?� �What do you feel?� �What do you hear?� 



They may discover new sounds�a woodpecker searching for embedded bugs in tree bark, the sound of male cicadas signaling a mate, birds singing, a crow cawing, or a squirrel scampering up a tree. They might see a chipmunk darting back into the safety of its burrow, a robin running across the grass and stopping briefly to listen intently for the movement of an earthworm below the ground, a bird�s nest high in a tree, or the movement of leaves on a tree blowing in the wind. They can feel the roughness of bark on a tree, cool dirt, gritty sand, and jagged rocks.



Teachers can further deepen children�s discoveries by asking more specific questions about what they found or discovered with their senses, which will promote the next level of inquiry. For example, ask, �What can you do with these nature items?� �What do these things remind you of?� �What can these items do?� or �Where did you find these things you collected?�



Next, teachers can support student nature observations through documentation by taking photographs, recording conversations, revisiting nature environments, and bringing nature inside. Teachers can also empower their students to enhance their own nature experiences by providing them with small box cameras if their class budget allows, magnifying glasses, and shovels for digging, as well as small squares of paper and writing tools for drawing what they see.



Children can revisit familiar nature spots where they�ll discover something new; using wondering questions will often give children a new perspective on an already investigated area. For example, a teacher may ask, �Does the ground look wet or dry?� or �Does the dirt have new holes in it?� or �Did you notice shadows today?�





Creating a Nature Documentation Center



It�s important to observe where and what the children are interested in and support those interests by documenting each student�s thoughts and ideas. Educators can create a �Nature Documentation Center� in their classroom. This area doesn�t need to be complex in any way, and both teacher and students can utilize it. When nature is brought from outside to inside the classroom, both teacher and students can benefit. Creating a designated space gives students opportunities to further observe and ponder their found nature materials; it enables scenarios where students can partner and work together, and perhaps share and explain to fellow students what first drew them to collect their nature items.��



Using baskets, shoeboxes, or small fabric or paper bags, students can collect appropriate nature items to transfer into the classroom. Teachers can determine within their classroom schedules if one or more days can be designated for nature collecting. Having a student-friendly area to drop off nature items can be ideal: a table, a bookshelf, lower cubby areas, designated bins, or perhaps shoeboxes with tops or cigar boxes with children�s names, which can be easily stacked in a corner. A shoe bag with student names on each pocket can give each student their own space to drop off items. These can easily be hung over a door or stuck to the wall with removable hooks.



Using fishing line or wire, hang light objects found in nature�pine cones, sticks, leaves, or flowers�on a small tree branch, either suspended from a ceiling (if permitted by licensing) or placed in a container filled with sand for stability. This method not only documents student discoveries but is a beautiful art installation.�



The Nature Documentation Center will give students a sense of pride and accomplishment, a daily reminder of their personal discoveries from nature and their further quest of continuing to carefully watch and learn how nature is designed and how they play a part in preserving it.



Specific activities can center around temporary nature investigations that students  do in the classroom and then dismantle and return to nature. For example, trays of dirt can be part of a science activity; students can explore the dirt with magnifying glasses or, if available, a microscope to search for microscopic animals, mold, fungi, or small particles of sand and dirt composition. Additionally, students can gently observe small living creatures�earthworms, grubs, beetles, ants�or even cicada exoskeletons. Of course, returning all living creatures back to nature further supports empathy and respect for all living things.�



No matter how grand or small your ways of connecting your students to nature, the most valuable thing is to break down the barrier of thinking that nature is dangerous, scary, or unattainable to young children. Experiences with nature give children the tools they need to appreciate our Earth and hopefully to care for one another."
Education,60,Creating Effective and Efficient Breaks for Students During the School Day,https://www.edutopia.org/article/creating-effective-breaks-students,https://wpvip.edutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hero_blog_elem_special-education_photo_iStock_1395171283_lithiumcloud.jpg?w=2000&quality=85,14-09-23," Short breaks allow students who struggle with regulation time to regroup, which improves their learning outcomes.",Creating Effective Breaks for Students | Edutopia,"Many students with behavior disorders have sensory issues and don�t realize when they are overstimulated. Those who have not mastered self-regulation strategies to cope with excess stimulation require periodic breaks during the day to regroup. Sometimes we call these sensory breaks, check-and-connect sessions, zen time, etc. These moments are great in theory, but in the teaching world, it can be difficult to find time for them.



Often, gen-ed teachers can�t squeeze time into their busy days to schedule these breaks, so it might be best to hand off this responsibility to resource teachers, counselors, or behavior coaches who can host the breaks in their rooms.



Some of us might see this time as an extra recess for the students, while others may see it as a way to get a break from the students, since they will be in a different part of the building. But the reality is that these breaks are necessary for some students to be able to function at their best during the school day.



When done correctly, time away like this can be efficient and highly impactful in our students� day. To create effective breaks, we need to follow three main guidelines:



They need to happen consistently.

They need to follow a routine.

They need to end with some debriefing.



When we can follow these guidelines, we can create easily added support for these students.



Break Consistency



These breaks must happen every day and, if possible, at the same time each day. They should be part of the students� daily schedule. When planning breaks, we should place them after times when the students are more active or overstimulated (i.e., after lunch or recess). These are generally times when the students can have trouble transitioning, so this becomes an added support in that area. One effective option is to schedule breaks as the students are transferring between their classes.



The break should occur whether they are having a great day or greatly struggling. The students need the break to keep the consistent routine and as a way to check in. The break should last for about the same time each day; once our students were used to their breaks, they would take about five to seven minutes. The idea is that this becomes a part of the day that is a constant for the students and helps them regulate themselves.



Break Routines



It�s important to follow and stick with a routine for each break. These routines are adapted and changed based on the student. When starting a break schedule with a student, teaching them how the break should work is essential. They need to practice walking into the break area and working with the different tools they can use during this break. Students need to know that this is not playtime or punishment. It�s a time for them to step away from everyone and have a few minutes to regulate themselves.



When the routine is practiced enough, it can happen without much instruction. As my students mastered their break routines, they could come in and get started using nonverbal cues to check in with me. I would set a timer to start the break, and then we would check in at the end. The break could even be done while I worked with other students. I use the following routine with my students:



9:20 a.m. Student comes in from electives and uses the Zones of Regulation color chart, which helps them sort through their emotions.

9:20 a.m. Three-minute timer is started.

9:22 a.m. One-minute warning is issued.

9:23 a.m. Student comes to check out.

9:25 a.m. Student heads back to class.



Post-Break Debriefing



At the end of the break, there should always be a time for you to check in with the student individually. This timing gets tricky when you have multiple students coming in and out for breaks around the same time as each other. Still, when it�s built into their routine that this will happen, they tend to look forward to some one-on-one time with you. The idea is to see how the student�s mood has changed at the end of the break. By the time they see you, they will have had some time to themselves to reflect on the day or to become more regulated.



When they come to you, they should be able to tell you how they are feeling. I use the Zones of Regulation color chart, so they can tell me a color and then a mood. After this check-in, we have one of two outcomes: Either I can praise them for having a great day and give them reinforcement to keep it going, or they can use this time to plan how to turn their day around. This can entail deciding to work in a specific area in the classroom or checking in with their teacher about the expectations for the rest of the day.



The critical part here is that if any of the student�s answers are �I don�t know,� they have time to rethink how their day is going or how they can turn it around. These debriefs also give you as a teacher time to see how their day is going so far, so that you can help make adjustments with their gen-ed teacher.



These breaks can be the difference between success and struggle for our students who are still learning how to self-monitor and self-regulate. When they cannot do this and are not given tools to help them, challenging behaviors start to show, derailing learning for the whole classroom. It�s essential to support our students with these needs. These breaks teach them to be self-sufficient and give them the tools necessary to succeed in their education.



Don�t expect a magical transformation overnight; it takes trial and error to find the right time for student breaks. Still, when done correctly, these moments can help students regulate themselves and find school a more inviting learning environment."

Universal and Focus Features offered the film a spot on the back of its seat, and what better time to relaunch the promotional campaign for a film starring Austin Butler than ahead of his much-buzzed-about role as Feyd-Rautha in Dune: Part Two? Check out the new trailer below:

With Nichols drawing inspiration from a book of photographs by Danny Lyons, The Bikeriders is also anchored by Tom Hardy and Jodie Comer in the story of the brooding Benny (Butler), who joins a rough-and-ready motorcycle gang called The Vandals.

Led by Hardy's scruffy, hard-driving Johnny, we'll see how the gang rose to prominence, dishing out vengeance and rough justice to those who get in their way, all while Kathy grapples with Benny's commitment to the Vandals, and the effect it has on their lives.

One of the greatest cinematic delights of 2023 was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem � the all-action animated adventure from director Jeff Rowe and writer-producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, which dared to make the teenage turtles actual teenagers, and doused the entire affair in a distinctive fuzzy-pencil art style and �90s hip-hop hits to boot. It was a moderate hit at the box office and received a raft of positive reviews � and now a sequel is officially confirmed.

As unveiled in a Paramount release slate, the follow-up to Mutant Mayhem is underway, and expected to release on 9 October 2026. Director Jeff Rowe is expected to return, and it seems like the four turtle actors � Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon � and April O�Neal vocal star Ayo Edebiri will follow suit. As teased at the end of the first film, the sequel will bring in Turtles big-bad Shredder � and as Rowe teased to Empire last year, his arrival will seriously up the stakes. �The one thing I can say without spoiling anything is, [Shredder] needs to be 100 times scarier than Superfly � who is a credible villain, he�s dangerous, he�s strong, he seems like he could mess the Turtles up,� he explained. �Shredder needs to be that, just significantly more. It�ll be really interesting to see these fun-loving characters go up against something that maybe they can�t stop.�

While there�s a couple-of-years wait in store (understandable given the wow-factor of Mutant Mayhem�s animation style), there�s plenty more Turtacular goodness arriving in the meantime. Tie-in cartoon series Tales Of The Teenage Mutant Turtles will bring the full complement of half-shelled heroes back, and a video game is in the works too.

Yet after a revolving door of directors, writers and potential leads, it's finally headed our way this year, with Bill Skarsg�rd playing the tragic Eric Draven and Rupert Sanders directing. Check out the first images from the new adaptation of James O'Barr's graphic novel above and below.

O'Barr's original story focuses on Eric, a young man who, along with his fiancee Shelly, is brutally assaulted and slaughtered by a gang when their car breaks down. Eric is resurrected by a supernatural crow to stalk and seek vengeance against those responsible for the crime. Alex Proyas' 1994 film retooled the story around rock musician Eric Draven, who is murdered along with his fiancee Shelly on Devil's Night in Detroit and hunts down their killers.

The movie based on Barr's tale became infamous for the on-set death of star Brandon Lee following an accident with a blank gun round. The film was followed by three sequels of less repute critically and commercially; The Crow: City of Angels, starring Vincent Perez in 1996, The Crow: Salvation starring Eric Mabius in 2000 and The Crow: Wicked Prayer in 2005, which had Edward Furlong in the lead. There was even a late-1990s TV series that featured Mark Dacascos.

Quite how Sanders' version (written by King Richard's Zach Baylin alongside William Schneider) tweaks the narrative remains to be seen � the basic official synopsis points to a recognisable tale of murder and mystical vengeance, this take on Eric (Skarsg�rd) and Shelly (FKA Twigs) killed and his being brought back to track down those responsible.

And the tone? ""I grew up listening to Joy Division and the Cure, and this movie is a bit like a Cure song � the beauty of melancholy,"" Sanders told Vanity Fair.

The film, which is drawing comparisons to Gregg Araki's work, tells the story of Owen (played by Ian Foreman when he's younger and primarily by Smith) is just trying to survive life in the suburbs. He's having parental problems (his mother, played by Danielle Deadwyler, babies him and his father, played by Fred Durst, is a controlling monster), but his life changes when he bonds with schoolmate Maddy (Lundy-Paine).

Maddy shares his fascination with mysterious late-night, Buffy-style YA horror drama called The Pink Opaque � a vision of a supernatural world beneath their own. As he dives deeper into the show, Owen�s view of reality begins to crack.

Boasting a killer soundtrack that includes Yeule and Caroline Polachek, it's shaping up to be a neon-tinted dive into emotions and terror. I Saw The TV Glow lands Stateside on 3 May but has yet to lock down a UK date."

Night long established and now daughter Ishana stepping up her own career, the Shyamalan family filmmaking business is trundling ahead nicely. Having served as second unit director on Old and being a key member of the Servant creative team, Ishana Night Shyamalan is making her feature directorial debut with The Watched, which stars Dakota Fanning, Georgina Campbell and Olwen Fou�r�. Check out the first trailer for the horror thriller right here:

Fanning here plays Mina, an artist who becomes stranded in a giant, untouched forest somewhere in Ireland. Stumbling on a mysterious glass-walled home, she thinks she might have found safe shelter.

But no! As it turns out, she's soon trapped alongside three strangers who are watched all night by unseen, peculiar creatures. What's really going on? It's a Shyamalan film, so we're expecting some surprises.

Adapted from AM Shine's novel by Ishana Night Shyamalan and produced by M. Night, Ashwin Rajan and Nimitt Mankad, The Watched (which for some reason � we're guessing a name clash with some other copyrighted moniker � was renamed from the Stateside version The Watchers), will be out in the UK on 7 June."

The film is finally headed to UK cinemas, and you can see the trailer below:

Based on the graphic novel by Sara Varon, Robot Dreams is the story of Manhattan-dwelling Dog, who is, well, a dog. Feeling the pang of loneliness, he sends away for a kit to build his very own robot pal. The mechanized result sparks a fast friendship, the pair spending time together during a fun New York summer in the 1980s.

But one summer night, Robot's power runs down on a beach and Dog is forced to abandon him. Will the two best mates meet again? You'll get the answer to that when Robot Dreams arrives on UK screens on 22 March."

Now that project also has a writer/director. Nick Cassavetes will be sweeping up the eyeballs at the Double Deuce.

Son of John, brother of Xan, Cassavetes has a long CV as an actor (he even played himself in Entourage, as did Rousey in the movie), but also has eight credits to his name behind the camera, with several other projects in the works.

In terms of crunchy drama we might look to John Q or Alpha Dog for clues to what he might do with Road House.

He also made The Other Woman and The Notebook, which Variety claim got him through the Road House door. ""Strong female characters"", y'see.


  Nobody ever wins a fight


The original Road House sees the owner of the sleazy bar, tired of his joint being wrecked by muscle-bound �power drinkers� and provocative bimbos, hiring the best bouncer in the business (Swayze) to cool things down.

Pre-dating his Bodhi in Point Break by a couple of years, Swizzle is similarly Zen here, preaching that ""nobody ever wins a fight"". But he will resort to extreme throat-ripping measures when pushed to his limit.

Rousey, frankly, will nail this new version, and has apparently reached out to Swayze�s widow, Lisa Niemi, to get her blessing, which she received. The studio has Road House on a fast track, with production pencilled in for sometime next year."

Directed by Niki Caro and starring Liu Yifei, Jet Li and Gong Li, it�s a big budget, special effects rich, star-studded blockbuster. In our review, we praised it as �not only the best live-action Disney adaptation to date, but also a dazzling, moving, hair-prickling spectacle�. And now you can enjoy Mulan from the comfort of your own sofa (or bed � we�re not judging) when you unlock Disney+ Premier Access for an additional fee of �19.99.

Like the 1998 animated Disney favourite, this film follows the tale of Mulan (Liu Yifei), who disguises herself as man to take her the place of her father (Tzi Ma) in the army after the Emperor (Jet Li) conscripts one man from every family to fight against an invading army. In this retelling, we are introduced to two new baddies � Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), who both come with back stories of hurt and vengeance.

One of the things that makes this film such a blockbuster is the extraordinary battle scenes. Specialist stunt teams were brought in from China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, New Zealand and Australia to train and choreograph the lead actors and an army of 100 extras. The team also studied numerous styles of martial arts, assigning armies and characters with their own forms of movement. Characters such as Mulan, Commander Tung and Xian Lang have a fighting style inspired by the grace and fluidity of Tai Chi and Wushu, whereas the Imperial Army were trained with an ancient military precision.

This sweeping film came to life across 20 locations in China, including Hubei province in central China, the so-called Singing Sand Dunes in the Mingsha Shan Desert in Xinjiang Province in the northwest, Zhangye Danxia National Geological Park in north central China, Flame Mountain in the north, Mazar Village and Dunhuang and Jiuquan in Gansu province in the northwest, as well as studios in Zhejiang province in eastern China. These expansive locations played home to pastel-coloured villages and epic battles as our heroine moves through her epic tale.

And now you can watch this cinematic spectacle from your own home. You can watch the live-action Mulan over and over again when you unlock Premier Access on Disney+ for an additional fee of �19.99. Subscription required."

The film sees Carey Mulligan as Cassie, a 30-year-old woman who dropped out of med school and put her career plans on hold after her best friend died in a mysterious tragedy. She now spends her nights on the hunt for sexual predators, pretending to be blind drunk and waiting for the wolves to close in.

Mulligan is joined in the film by a stellar supporting cast, including Jennifer Coolidge and Clancy Brown as Cassie's parents, as well as Allison Brie, Bo Burnham, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Connie Britton and Chris Lowell.

With Fennell's whip-smart script, stunning costume design from Nancy Steiner (The Virgin Suicides, Twin Peaks: The Return), and a sinister, growling score from Anthony B. Willis that perfectly compliments the film's fizzy, pop soundtrack, the film not only took home an Oscar win and four nominations, but two of the most prestigious awards a this year's BAFTA Film awards, including Outstanding British Film and Best Original Screenplay. Not to mention a full five star review from Empire.

After much speculation on the matter, Variety has heard from sources that Ryan Gosling will perform the Academy Award-nominated song ""I'm Just Ken"" from Barbie on stage during the 96th awards next month.

Though the Academy has yet to officially confirm that Gosling will be espousing blonde fragility at the ceremony, you can well imagine what a boost it would be for the actor, who is Oscar nominated himself for the Ken role, to belt out the song.

Gosling himself wasn't sure it would happen, telling the trade mag back in February, ""It might be too much of a risk to have me do it. I don�t know how that would work. But I�m open to it.""

In related news, we've now learned about some of the people who will be presenting awards on the night, as last year's acting winners Michelle Yeoh, Brendan Fraser, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ke Huy Quan are all confirmed (as is traditional), alongside Jessica Lange, Matthew McConaughey, Lupita Nyong�o, Al Pacino, Sam Rockwell, Michelle Pfeiffer and Zendaya.

The Academy Awards this year will be held on 10 March, and UK viewers will be able to watch them on ITV1 and ITVX.

From Dances With Wolves, to Open Range, to Wyatt Earp and beyond, he�s long seemed at home in the Old West, telling stories of American history. Not to mention, in recent years he�s rustled up millions of viewers as the figurehead of Yellowstone, one of the biggest TV phenomenons of the last decade. But it�s now that he�s about to unleash his all-out Western epic � a long-gestating passion project titled Horizon: An American Saga, in which he stars as well as directing, co-writing (along with Jon Baird), and produces. It is, in fact, two feature-length movies � actually set to be four, if he continues to the full fruition of his vision � to be released cinematically this summer. And he�s invested in this in a huge way � literally, since it�s a self-financed project that he's pumped millions of his own cash into. Check out the trailer here:

You have to hand it to Costner, literally putting his money where his mouth is � Horizon looks huge, epic in scope and scale, and clearly its creator believes strongly in the material. Frankly, it�s hard to disagree that � for all the success of Yellowstone and its many spin-offs � the Western really belongs on the big screen, where those astonishing landscapes and epic narratives can unfold without restrictions. This is Costner�s first feature as director since Open Range, with an epic cast that also includes Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Owen Crow Show, Tatanka Means, Danny Huston, Michael Rooker, Will Patton, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrmann, Jamie Campbell Bower and Angus Macfadyen, to name but a fraction of the starring players.

Horizon is described as �a multi-faceted chronicle covering the Civil War expansion and settlement of the American West�, with �a story of America too big for one film� � and it�s hard to argue, given the evidence in the trailer. Here�s the official synopsis: �In the great tradition of Warner Bros. Pictures� iconic Westerns, Horizon: An American Saga explores the lure of the Old West and how it was won � and lost � through the blood, sweat and tears of many. Spanning the four years of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, Costner�s ambitious cinematic adventure will take audiences on an emotional journey across a country at war with itself, experienced through the lens of families, friends and foes all attempting to discover what it truly means to be the United States of America.�

The trailer offers an unapologetically old-school look at a film that itself seems intentionally old-school � and if the Yellowstone crowd turns up in force, we might even see Costner pull off Chapter 3 and 4 after all. Bring on the big-screen release of Horizon this summer."

That's a risky endeavour, but when you consider that last year's Indie Spirit Best Feature Everything Everywhere All At Once went on to win big at the Oscars, hopes are certainly higher for Celine Song's Past Lives' Best Picture chances come 10 March (though no one is discounting Oppenheimer, which was ineligible for the Indie Sprits).

Song also picked up Best Director for her emotional tale of reconnection and regret, While AV Rockwell took Best First Feature for A Thousand And One and Co-writer/director Babak Jalali won the John Cassavetes Award for best feature made for under $1 million for Fremont.

The Holdovers took home the most film gongs, nabbing Best Cinematography for Eigil Bryld, a welcome Best Breakthrough Performance for Dominic Sessa and in what should probably this year be renamed the Da�Vine Joy Randolph Award, she won her latest trophy: Best Supporting Performance.

How To Blow Up A Pipeline's Daniel Garber won Best Editing, American Fiction's Jeffrey Wright nabbed Best Lead Performance (the Indie Spirits have been gender neutral for their acting awards for a while), and the latter also saw writer/director Cord Jefferson score Best Screenplay.

Best First Screenplay was given to May December's Samy Burch and Alex Mechanik, with Anatomy Of A Fall named Best International Film. Four Daughters was Best Documentary and Dear Mama won Best New Non-Scripted Or Documentary Series.

With the Spirits also recognizing TV, The Last Of Us' Nick Offerman won another award, this time Best Supporting Performance In A New Scripted Series, with the show's Keivonn Montreal Woodard given Best Breakthrough Performance In A New Scripted Series. Best New Scripted series went to perennial winner Beef, while that show's Ali Wong took Best Lead Performance In A New Scripted Series."

He's now attached to make a live-action film based on the hugely popular Naruto manga.

Lionsgate has had this one in development since at least 2015, with Avi and Ari Arad on board to produce alongside Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves' Jeremy Latcham.

Naruto, in case it has somehow slipped your attention, was created by Masashi Kishimoto. The coming-of-age story focuses on enthusiastic young ninja Naruto Uzumaki who has ambitions to be the leader of his village, but must also deal with possessing the spirit of a nine-tailed demon fox. Who among us, etc, etc�

Originally serialized in print form via Japan's weekly title Shonen Jump between 1999 to 2014, it has become one of the biggest mangas (the third best-selling in history, after One Piece and Dragon Ball), and has been adapted into a variety of animated series and movies.

Live-action has not been a forgiving medium for stories that have their roots in manga and anime, even now � for every success story such as One Piece, you have the more mixed fortunes of Avatar: The Last Airbender. But Naruto's creator has confidence in Cretton.

""When I heard of Destin�s attachment, it happened to be right after watching a blockbuster action film of his, and I thought he would be the perfect director for Naruto,"" said Kishimoto in a statement carried by The Hollywood Reporter. ""After enjoying his other films and understanding that his forte is in creating solid dramas about people, I became convinced that there is no other director for Naturo. In actually meeting Destin, I also found him to be an open-minded director who was willing to embrace my input, and felt strongly that we would be able to cooperate together in the production process.""

To switch back to the Marvel universe for a moment, Shang-Chi star Simu Liu has said recently that Cretton is still developing the sequel to that film, which we really hope happens, even if Liu's character will likely crop up in future team-up movies. And given the slower pace of the MCU these days, there's a good chance Cretton can squeeze Naruto in before the sequel begins shooting.

Saturday night saw the film take Outstanding Performance By A Cast In Motion Picture, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for Cillian Murphy and Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role for Robert Downey Jr.

Following a year in which actors walked the picket line for a better contract with studios, there was even more impetus to celebrate, the show switching from its former Stateside cable home to Netflix's live offerings, where there were no commercials and a more liberal swearing policy. Billie Eilish signed ""superfan"" Melissa McCarthy's head. The casts of Breaking Bad, Modern Family and leads from The Devil Wears Prada and The Lord Of The Rings reunited to hand out gongs. Barbara Streisand got a rousing standing ovation as she collected a Lifetime Achievement Award.

But yes, on the film side it was certainly Oppenheimer's night, Barbie going home with zilch, The Holdovers Da�Vine Joy Randolph nabbing another Supporting Actor award and Lily Gladstone's Killers Of The Flower Moon work named Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. Which means Best Actress might be one of the few Academy Award categories still considered a race � will it be Gladstone or Emma Stone on 10 March?

Indeed, for the most part, the awards followed the pattern of previous ceremonies this years � to paraphrase both JM Barrie's Peter Pan and Battlestar Galactica's Cylons, ""All of this has happened before. All of this will happen again."" Well, perhaps not the ""again"" part on the TV front, since the delayed SAG event meant it followed the Emmys. But there were certainly repeat trips to the stage for The Bear leads Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri (while the show won Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series) and Beef main duo Ali Wong and Steven Yeun. Perhaps the only real surprise was Pedro Pascal in a rare victory over Succession's Kieran Culkin, the Last Of Us star accepting in teary-eyed, self-professed drunk fashion.

Still Succession's cast could content themselves with Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series to see off the show, while Elizabeth Debicki won Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series for playing Princess Diana in The Crown. And because SAG is one of the few bodies to recognize stunts, the teams behind The Last Of Us and Mission: Impossible � Dead Reckoning Part One took their respective categories."

Now, on the heels of him making a deal with Warner Bros., it appears he's tracked down his choice. Cruise is on to star in Alejandro G. I��rritu's next, untitled film.

Little is known about the new project, as the director is keeping it top secret for now. Deadline has learned that he wrote it in 2023 with Sabina Berman alongside his Birdman collaborators Alexander Dinelaris and Nicolas Giacobone.

I��rritu took a break between 2015's Oscar-winning The Revenant and 2022's Bardo: False Chronicle Of A Handful Of Truths, which was released via Netflix.

As for Cruise, he has a number of projects on his To Do list, including a much-mooted movie to be shot in space with Doug Liman in the director's pilot seat. But from the sounds of the new report, he'll next work on the I��rritu film, which Warner Bros. and Legendary are in negotiations to acquire.

And this new development would seem to put paid to Cruise's involvement in Quentin Tarantino's next � and potentially final � film, The Movie Critic, which is another project he's shown interest in.

Take a look:

Standing with the writer/director as well as producer Peter Safran (who co-oversees the DC movie arm of Warner Bros. with him) are David Corenswet (Clark Kent/Superman), Rachel Brosnahan (Lois Lane), Nicholas Hoult (Lex Luthor), Skyler Gisondo (Jimmy Olsen), Nathan Fillion (Guy Gardener), Isabela Mercad (Hawkgirl), Anthony Carrigan (Metamorpho), Terence Rosemore (Otis), Edi Gathegi (Mister Terrific), Sara Sampaio (Eve Teschmacher) and Mar�a Gabriela de Far�a (Angela Spica/The Engineer). Not pictured? Sean Gunn, who is playing Maxwell Lord. And � assuming the Gunn regular is actually going to be in the film � Michael Rooker, possibly just off to the side, wondering why he was asked to get the coffee.

Superman: Legacy, which has Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely�s 2005 comic book run All-Star Superman as its inspiration, will see Clark Kent working at the Daily Planet alongside ace reporter Lois, while dealing with threats from the likes of Luthor.

The film will gear up to production shortly with an 11 July, 2025 release date already locked in."

(more on that in a moment), we were already anticipating German director Moritz Mohr's bloody and bizarre Boy Meets World. The trailer for the film just increases that feeling�

The titular ""Boy"" here is played by Bill Skarsg�rd, who as a youngster was left orphaned, deaf and mute in a post-apocalyptic world by a cruel ruling family who quell resistance to their rule by culling dissidents annually.

Trained by a mysterious shaman Yayan Ruhian in martial arts and weapons use, he becomes an instrument of vengeance, employing his skills to take down those who wronged him, teaming up with a resistance group at the same time. Oh, and did we mention he also sometimes bickers with the ghost of his rebellious younger sister?

His inner voice, meanwhile, comes courtesy of Bob's star H. John Benjamin, the recognizable tones borrowed by our hero from his video game obsession of years past. With Sam Raimi aboard as producer after sparking to Mohr's proof-of-concept trailer, we fully expect carnage.

Jessica Rothe, Michelle Dockery, Brett Gelman, Isaiah Mustafa, Andrew Koji, Sharlto Copley and Famke Janssen are in the cast, and US audiences will see this one in cinemas on 26 April. We're still waiting to learn when it'll hit the UK."

First, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania underperformed significantly, intended to be the Multiverse Saga uber-villain�s big launch on the world. Then, months after allegations were made against him, actor Jonathan Majors was found guilty of assault in December, at which point he was dropped by the studio. In the wake of all that, Marvel Studios is said to be retooling its plans for the future � plans which originally had the next Avengers movie down as The Kang Dynasty.

According to a new THR report, Marvel is said to be dropping the name The Kang Dynasty for Avengers 5, a move which is said to be a reflection of both Majors� removal from the role, and the underwhelming reaction to Quantumania. The film previously had Shang-Chi�s Destin Daniel Cretton as director, though he since exited the project; original writer Jeff Loveness (who also penned Quantumania) also left the film, replaced by Michael Waldron. The film doesn�t currently have a director publicly announced. It�s still dated for 1 May 2026, though it would be unsurprising if that changed too.

It�s unclear what direction Marvel moves in next for its wider plan � previous reports have hinted that Galactus may take over big-bad duties, while Avengers 6 is still down as Secret Wars. For now, all focus is on this summer�s Deadpool & Wolverine, the freshly-cast The Fantastic Four, and the animated return of the mutants in X-Men �97."

And with the first trailer now online, we can see the results of all that work, with Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jack Black and Ariana Greenblatt front and centre. Take a look:

Borderlands follows Blanchett Lilith, a notorious outlaw and fortune-seeker who heads back to her home planet of Pandora (a place she was only too happy to leave in the first place) on a mission to track down the missing daughter of the wealthy and evil Atlas (Edgar Ramirez).

It doesn't hurt that the planet also boasts a reportedly huge treasure lurking with in vault, so Lilith gathers a team to help her on this dual endeavor: Roland (Hart), a former elite mercenary looking for some redemption, Tiny Tina (Greenblatt), a violent pre-teen demolitionist, her musclebound guardian Krieg (Florian Munteanu), Tannis (Curtis), a scientist with a tenuous grip on sanity, and Claptrap (Black), a wise-cracking robot who can apparently be shot multiple times and, er, wee the bullets out.

There is a definite feel of someone pointing to Guardians Of The Galaxy and asking for something like that, with the game's basic set up and team dynamic fitting the bill. Will Lilith and co. reach the pop cultural impact of Rocket Raccoon and the gang? We'll find out when Borderlands is released on 9 August."

Lingayats come next, followed by Vokkaligas and then other castes.The report, therefore, has faced stiff opposition.

In yet another major setback ahead of the general elections, Lok Sabha MP Ritesh Pandey resigned from the Mayawati-led BSP and joined the BJP on February 25. Reports suggest that three more BSP MPs are poised to follow suit before the general elections, with another BSP MP considering a switch to Jayant Chaudhary's Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).Previously, Ghazipur MP Afzal Ansari had already secured a Samajwadi Party (SP) ticket from the same seat, while Amroha MP Danish Ali, suspended by the BSP for anti-party activities, is set to join the Congress. Another BSP MP from Jaunpur joined Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on February 25. Consequently, out of a total 10 MPs in 2019, Mayawati's party may end up with retaining only two.It appears that BSP leaders, in a last-ditch effort to salvage their political futures, are fleeing to safer havens, leaving the once formidable party in a state of limbo. Following the seat pact between the SP and the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, BSP leaders fear diminished electoral prospects as the contest shifts into a direct confrontation between the BJP-led NDA and the SP-Congress combine. Despite disappointment from both INDIA bloc parties and her own party leaders, Mayawati has remained steadfast in her stance that the BSP will contest the upcoming elections alone, notwithstanding its previous alliance with SP-RLD in 2019, which yielded 10 seats.Disconnect With People Behind The Decline �The BSP's decline has been in the making for a long time now. In the 2007 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the party secured 206 seats, garnering over 30% of the votes. This success was largely attributed to Mayawati's ability to forge an unlikely alliance between Brahmins and Dalits, securing a majority. However, subsequent elections saw a steady decline, with the BSP winning only 80 seats in 2012, down to 19 in 2017, and finally just one in 2022, in the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh assembly. In 2022, for the first time, its vote share dropped to just 12.88%.In the Lok Sabha, the BSP's fortunes mirrored this descent, plummeting from 21 seats in 2009 to zero in 2014. The alliance with the SP-RLD in 2019 provided a brief respite, resulting in 10 seats. Notably, its vote share remained consistent between 19% and 21% in 2014 and 2019.Changing FriendshipsRank opportunism and shrewd manoeuvres have defined Mayawati's political career. Riding on the promise of political empowerment for Dalits, Muslims, and other marginalised social groups, she served as Uttar Pradesh chief minister four times, aligning with different parties at different times. These electoral alliances were strategically formed to benefit the BSP, with tie-ups being discarded once they no longer served its interests. Even in 2019, Mayawati terminated the alliance with the SP's Akhilesh Yadav, her arch-rival, despite its electoral gains, leading to the BSP winning only one seat in the 2022 assembly elections while contesting alone. The SP in contrast got 111 seats.""While there is no denying the fact that the BSP is no longer a potent force in Uttar Pradesh and has been reduced to a minor player in the electoral arena, it will be a grave mistake to think that the party could be ignored. A party that still has around 13 per cent vote share may not be able to win many seats but it can definitely influence the outcome of the polls,"" says Sanjay Pandey, a political analyst.BSP's Loss, BJP's GainTwo factors have contributed to the BSP's slide. Firstly, the BJP has succeeded in attracting Dalit voters on a large scale through its Hindutva agenda and various welfare schemes, leading to a disillusionment with the BSP. This disenchantment paved the way for smaller caste parties, such as the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and the Nishad Party, to eat into the BSP's base. The emergence of alternative Dalit leaders, such as Chandrashekhar's Azad Samaj Party, further fractured the BSP's support base. Leaders like O.P. Rajbhar, Dara Singh Chauhan and Swami Prasad Maurya left in search of greener pastures, significantly denting the BSP's core support base.Muslim voters, too, have oscillated between loyalty to the SP and the Congress, perceiving these parties as better-equipped to challenge the BJP. The BSP's decision to contest alone further diminishes its appeal, resulting in a shift of Muslim votes to the SP-Congress alliance.""Dalit vote of the BSP will mainly shift to the BJP. Muslims may move to the SP-Congress alliance as there is no third alternative. Though BSP may not be in a winning position, it will still try to keep its vote share intact,"" says J.P. Shukla, a senior political analyst based in Lucknow.The 'Third Party'?With many alleged corruption cases pending against her, Mayawati has adopted a guarded approach as far as her politics is concerned. For the BJP, it suits to use the BSP as the 'third party' to turn the battle in Uttar Pradesh into a triangular one. ��""The BJP will also want to see that the BSP remains in the fight in at least Muslim-dominant constituencies,"" adds Shukla.The upcoming general elections are poised to be a two-party contest in Uttar Pradesh, between the BJP and the SP-Congress alliance. With Dalits increasingly gravitating towards the BJP over the past decade, the BSP might not be averse to subtle collaboration with the party. The BJP's Jatav support base has surged from 5% in 2012 to 21% in 2022, while its non-Jatav base has expanded from 11% in 2012 to 41% in 2022.Although the BSP has rebuffed overtures from the I.N.D.I.A bloc thus far, in politics, nothing is definitive. Uttar Pradesh, with its size and complexity, promises an engaging battle in the lead-up to the Lok Sabha elections.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com(Bharti Mishra Nath is a senior journalist)Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author"

For years he served as chief minister of Punjab province, his family's power base.During his tenure, he presided over a series of big-ticket infrastructure projects, including Pakistan's first metro bus service.Officials were reportedly kept on their toes by workaholic Sharif's habit of surprise visits to government offices, which he would inspect clad in a favoured safari suit and hat.Also Read""Not Wrong To Say Nawaz Sharif Is The One Who Built Pak"": Shehbaz SharifShehbaz Sharif Returns As Pakistan's Prime Minister For 2nd TermShehbaz Sharif, Omar Ayub File Nomination Papers For Pak PM Post: ReportStill, critics say he did little to address the province's core issues -- including the need for civil service, health and agricultural reforms.Instead, they say, he focussed on vote-grabbing boondoggles, such as distributing laptops to students or offering subsidised taxis to the jobless.Sharif has also been linked to graft and corruption -- charges supporters say sprang from a political vendetta by Khan.In December 2019, the National Accountability Bureau seized nearly two dozen properties belonging to Sharif and his son Hamza, accusing them of money laundering.He was arrested and detained in September 2020, but released around six months later on bail and was acquitted after he came to power the first time. �'Effective coordination'Sharif's first tenure was defined by a steep economic downturn and a campaign of defiance from popular Khan -- who was jailed and barred from office in the runup to polls.The premiership lasted less than a year and a half before he handed the reins to a caretaker government which ushered in elections last month.Unlike his elder brother -- whose relations with the country's powerful military and his opponents were strained -- Sharif was considered capable of compromising even with his enemies.Pakistan's military is the country's most powerful institution and has ruled the nation for nearly half its history -- and pulls the strings even when not actually governing.""I have always remained a strong supporter of effective coordination between Islamabad and Rawalpindi,"" Sharif said, referring to the administrative capital and the nearby military headquarters.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comSharif remains popular, particularly in Punjab, despite lurid tabloid headlines about multiple marriages and a property portfolio that includes luxury apartments in London and Dubai.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

So, when two BJP MPs said - within hours of each other - today that they would like to be ""relieved"" of their political duties, it took many by surprise.Sources have told NDTV, however, that the well-oiled election machinery of the BJP, which has conducted extensive surveys and held long deliberations on every Lok Sabha seat, had already decided not to repeat Gautam Gambhir and Jayant Sinha.While the party has not named a candidate for Mr Gambhir's constituency of East Delhi in its first list released today, Mr Sinha has not been named as the candidate from his earlier seat of Hazaribagh in Jharkhand.In a post on X around 10 am today, Gautam Gambhir said, ""I have requested Hon'ble Party President @JPNadda ji to relieve me of my political duties so that I can focus on my upcoming cricket commitments.""Less than five hours later, Jayant Sinha, made a nearly identical post.

Sources indicated that both MPs were not very popular in their constituencies and the BJP, which has set itself a target of winning a mammoth 370 seats, had decided not to repeat them.The decision followed a lengthy, detailed process, which included getting feedback from the people in every constituency, conducting internal evaluations, and hiring survey agencies to file comprehensive reports. These were followed by deliberations by the state leadership and the national brass.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comSources said the national leadership had made it clear that the MPs whose performance was not up to the mark would not be repeated and that at least 60 incumbent MPs could face this fate.On Thursday night, a five-hour meeting had been held in New Delhi, which was chaired by Prime Minister Modi and attended by Mr Shah and Mr Nadda, among others. The meeting, which began at 11 pm and ended at 4 am, had also focused on constituencies that the party hadn't done well in.

The BCCI recently announced the contracts for national team players with Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer missing out having opted to stay away from domestic cricket despite being available.India�s former World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev praised the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for its actions to safeguard domestic cricket on Friday (Mar 1). According to the legendary player, the decision by the BCCI to mandate players to play in domestic cricket will only protect the sport. The BCCI recently announced the contracts for national team players with Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer missing out on having opted to stay away from domestic cricket despite being available.

Kapil Dev lauds BCCI

�I congratulate the BCCI for taking the much-needed step to protect the status of domestic cricket. I was sad to see domestic cricket being given the skip by players once they had established themselves in international cricket. It was high time the message was given and this strong step by the BCCI will go a long way in restoring the prestige of domestic cricket,� Dev said while speaking to news agency PTI.

�I have always believed in the process of international players making themselves available to play for their respective states. It helps them extend their support to domestic players. Also it is a nice way to pay back for the services rendered by the state association in grooming a player,� he added.

The BCCI on Wednesday made a bold statement by excluding both Ishan and Shreyas from the central contracts despite them being part of the World Cup squad as recently as November. However, both opting to stay away from national as well as domestic duties prompted BCCI to take strict action. According to the new mandate players contracted to BCCI will have to serve for the national side when called up or represent their domestic sides.

What prompted BCCI to take action?

Ishan during the South Africa tour opted to miss the Test series having been down the pecking order in the Playing XI and was reportedly spotted in UAE at a party. He later missed matches for his domestic side Jharkhand in the Ranji Trophy despite being passed fit. His desire to focus on the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) and not show up for domestic duties did not augur well with the BCCI.

For Shreyas, he was part of the Indian team for the opening two Test matches against England but complained of back spasms. The National Cricket Academy (NCA) declared Shreyas fit, but he too like Ishan refrained from representing Mumbai or India.

It will be interesting to see how the players act with the eyes now on the T20 World Cup squad with Ishan being one of the first names on the team sheet. The BCCI will likely announce the World Cup squad in the second week of May with IPL in the focus."

He fed Davis for a dunk and capped the scoring with a free-throw.The Los Angeles Lakers, fueled by 40 points from Anthony Davis and 31 from LeBron James, pulled off another NBA thriller on Thursday, beating the Washington Wizards 134-131 in overtime. One day after James reeled off 34 points -- 19 of them in the fourth quarter -- to key a come-from-behind victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, the Lakers had to dig deep again against a Wizards team tied for the worst record in the league.

James's four points in overtime included a three-pointer that tied it at 131-131. He fed Davis for a dunk and capped the scoring with a free-throw. James, already the league's all-time scoring leader, is now nine points away from becoming the first player in NBA history to score 40,000 in the regular season.

Jordan Poole scored a season-high 34 points and Marvin Bagley III added 23 for Washington, who dropped their 13th straight. But Lakers coach Darvin Ham said the young, hungry Wizards were a tough opponent -- especially on the heels of Wednesday's draining victory. ""They put pressure, they're a tough team to play coming off a back-to-back, really high emotional game from last night,"" Ham said. ""But we found a way, we found a way to win. Our guys pulled together when we needed to and made the plays when we needed to.""

In Denver, star big man Nikola Jokic missed out on a fifth straight triple-double but Michael Porter Jr.'s 30 points fueled the Nuggets in a 103-97 victory over the Miami Heat in an NBA Finals rematch. Porter added 11 rebounds, helping fill the void after Jamal Murray departed in the second quarter with a sprained ankle. Jokic finished with 18 points, 11 rebounds, and seven assists as the Nuggets fended off Miami's fourth-quarter rally.

Bam Adebayo scored 22 points and Butler added 21 for the Heat, who were without injured Tyler Herro, Kevin Love, and Josh Richardson and saw their five-game winning streak end.

A trip to Madison Square Garden was just what Golden State star Stephen Curry needed to break out of his scoring doldrums. Curry scored 31 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead the Warriors to a 110-99 victory over the New York Knicks, bouncing back from a scoreless first half in the Warriors' win over the Wizards on Tuesday. Curry said he fed off the energy at Madison Square Garden -- an arena steeped in NBA history and where he broke the record for career three-pointers in 2021. ""It didn�t hurt that in the Garden I had a good vibe and a good flow going,"" Curry said. ""It's always fun. This is a special place."" Jonathan Kuminga added 25 points for Golden State, who grabbed a quick 14-0 lead and never trailed.

Jalen Brunson scored 27 points to lead the Knicks, who had the deficit down to four midway through the fourth quarter but with key contributors Julius Randle and OG Anunoby sidelined could never gain the upper hand.

Another sparkling effort from rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama helped the San Antonio Spurs snap a five-game losing streak with a 132-118 victory over Western Conference contenders Oklahoma City. French star Wembanyama scored 28 points with 13 rebounds and five blocked shots. The fourth quarter featured four lead changes, but with three-and-a-half minutes remaining Wembanyama produced a pair of three-pointers and a big block of a three-point attempt by Oklahoma City's rookie of the year contender Chet Holmgren, and the Spurs pulled away for the win. ""We're just playing with heart,"" Wembanyama said.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points, Jalen Williams added 26, and Holmgren contributed 23 for the Thunder, who slipped a game behind the Minnesota Timberwolves for the top spot in the Western Conference.

Two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 24 points and pulled down 10 rebounds for Milwaukee in the Bucks' 111-99 victory over the Hornets in Charlotte. Malik Beasley made five three-pointers on the way to 19 points for the Bucks, who pushed their winning streak to four games and completed a season sweep of the Hornets."

The teams will be competing in five matches of three days each.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is reintroducing domestic women's cricket after a hiatus of four years. The board announced the organization of an Inter Zonal multi-day trophy starting from March 28 in Pune. This decision follows recent Test matches played by the Indian women's team against England and Australia.

""It is a welcome step taken by BCCI. The national team has started playing Test cricket again and we need the next generation of cricketers to play red ball cricket at the domestic level,"" former India pacer Amita Sharma stated to news agency PTI.

Sharma also expressed her desire for red-ball cricket to be played at the state level, not just the zonal level, reminiscing about the past when both events existed.

The tournament will include teams from six zones: East, West, North, South, Central, and North East. These teams will compete in five matches of three days each, with the semifinals scheduled for April 3 and the final on April 9.

Meanwhile, women cricketers are currently participating in the second season of the Women's Premier League (WPL), a domestic T20 tournament similar to the Indian Premier League (IPL). The participating teams in the WPL are Royal Challengers Bangalore, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals, Gujarat Giants, and UP Warriroz.

In the ongoing 2024 WPL season, seven matches have been played thus far, with each team having played three games except for Giants, who have played two. Delhi Capitals lead the table with four points in three games, followed by Bangalore and Mumbai with the same number of wins but a lower net run rate than Delhi. UP Warriroz and Gujarat Giants occupy the fourth and fifth positions, respectively."

Gatland suggested Welsh rugby was ""plugging holes in a sinking ship"" in the wake of the 31-7 Six Nations loss to Ireland in Dublin on Saturday, having been asked about the differences in the domestic game in the respective countries. He said the four regional clubs needed to improve facilities and support staff before looking at player recruitment, comments Ospreys coach Toby Booth called ""inflammatory"" and ""clumsy"".

""I was asked the question about where Irish rugby was at, and where we were at, the structure and systems,"" Gatland told reporters on Thursday. ""You can take anything out of a few quotes to put in a story. What I was highlighting was the importance of us, for the next 10 years, if we want success and sustainability, having the best facilities and the best support staff, whether that�s coaches, medical staff, strength and conditioning, before we start thinking about anything else.

""Probably the difference between us and Ireland at the moment is they have got their systems and structures in place and we�ve got a little bit of a way to go. It wasn�t a criticism of coaches.""

But Gatland also stressed that the clubs needed to improve matters off the pitch before paying for expensive talent on it. ""Probably all of the regions, if they look at their structure and their support staff, they�ve got a couple of holes and things that they�re working to hopefully put right for the future,"" he said.

""I keep saying the right people and the right facilities will have so much more of an impact for us long-term than one or two players will do in a squad. We�ve just got to make sure we keep focusing on that.

""The pleasing thing for me is that it�s raised discussion. At least people are talking about it. My concern was if we don�t talk about it and focus on these areas, we�ll carry on doing what we�ve been doing for years and having the same results."""

The day's play started with Cameron Green (who was unbeaten on 103) resuming Australia's innings at 279-9. He added 71 runs to his overnight tally as Australia were dismissed for 383, from reeling at 267-9 at one stage. The home side fell flat in reply to hand over a big advantage to the opposition.

Green added a brilliant 116-run stand with pacer Josh Hazlewood for the final wicket as Australia went close to the 400-run mark. At one point, they were 156 for 5 on the opening day. The right-hander continued to find the gaps and even cleared the ropes on five occasions to take his side to a dominating position. From thereon, nothing clicked for Tim Southee-led hosts as they fell for 179, with Lyon becoming the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Tests, going past Courtney Walsh.

Lyon's 4 for 43 rocked the Kiwis as only Glenn Phillips (71) and pacer Matt Henry (42) stood tall for the home side.Most Wickets In Men's Tests

Apart from Lyon, Hazlewood chipped in with two scalps, giving their side a whopping 204-run lead. Before the end of the day's play, NZ skipper Southee removed Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne but Australia are still leading by 217 runs despite being 13 for 2 in their second essay. 

Thus, the hosts have a herculean task ahead to keep chipping in with regular breakthroughs to ensure Australia do not set up a big target."

Recently, Rashford was dropped for disciplinary reasons this season by manager Erik Ten Hag. Thus, questions about his commitment towards the Red Devils have emerged following his latest setback. The young striker has now hit back at naysayers. 

In an interview with The Players Tribune, England forward Rashford spoke at length about the constant talk regarding his form, family, and off-field activities which have affected him mentally. In addition, he stressed how the nature of the criticisms has led him to refrain from his usual ignorance towards the press. 

26-year-old Rashford said, ""I don�t normally like to respond to things said about me. It�s not in my nature. I�m an introvert... But if you ever question my commitment to Man United, that�s when I have to speak up.""Rashford has coped with a lot of criticism following his indifferent run in the 2023/24 season for Man United, who are struggling in the Premier League and are in the sixth position. Many believe the club's disappointing run is linked to Rashford's form. The striker has managed just five goals this season and also failed to make an impact in other competitions. In the 2022/23 season, he was in top form with a career-high 30 goals. His form has nosedived considerably this time around and given a chance to his critics to target him.Rashford feels the media has not been fair to him but is confident of bouncing back soon. He added, ""You know what, though? If I�m honest, a part of me doesn't mind it when people doubt me...Whenever I�ve been in my darkest of places, and it feels like half the world is against me, I tend to go off by myself for a couple of days and reset...every single time I�ve been down, physically or mentally, I always feel like that�s when I turn it around and play my best football for United and England.""

Rashford came under scrutiny recently for his alleged partying in Belfast. This caused him to miss United's fourth-round FA Cup clash versus Newport County. While some reports also indicate that he is willing to move elsewhere, he has completely denied it.

At present, the English footballer would like to take some time off and start afresh."

With a five-wicket win, Rohit Sharma-led India clinched the five-Test series 3-1 with one game left to play. Jurel led the charge with a fine 90, reducing England's lead to only 46, and made a crucial 39* in India's 192-run chase, along with Shubman Gill (52*) and Rohit's 55, as the home side won a tight contest.

Jurel also made his presence felt behind the stumps with his proactiveness and keeping skills. Thus, he was rightly named Player of the Match. His performance in Ranchi led to many former cricketers lauding the 23-year-old. Former Indian opener Sunil Gavaskar compared him to MS Dhoni, and now ex-spinner Anil Kumble has also joined the bandwagon.

Speaking on JioCinema, Kumble said, ""Dhruv Jurel certainly has all the credentials to get to where MS (Dhoni) reached in his career. He's not just shown the temperament of his technique to defence but even when he's attacking. Even in that first innings, he was very assured, he went after and then hit those big sixes.""""He's been exceptional, especially of the faster bowlers...He's only going to improve. This is only his second Test and I'm sure as he starts playing more and more he'll only get better. And it only augers well for India. And to have him in a squad is exceptional. Yeah, I mean it's not been easy for KS Bharat (the other keeper-batter),"" the former India head coach added.

Jurel made his Test debut in the third game in Rajkot, where he scored a vital 46 in the first innings. The youngster will be eager to keep going ahead in a similar manner in the fifth and final Test versus England in Dharamsala, which gets underway on March 7."

Sarfaraz has been one of the debutants for India in their ongoing five-match Test series versus England at home. The right-hander earned his debut cap in the third Test, in Ranchi, and made back-to-back fifties in his first game.

Speaking to RevSportz, Ganguly said, ""I think he�s more of a five-day player. His game is suited for that. T20 is a different format. And the amount of runs he scored in domestic cricket, in the Ranji trophy and in first-class cricket has been phenomenal. And as they say, if you score runs, it doesn�t go to waste. And that�s exactly what�s happened to Sarfaraz.""

Sarfaraz has toiled hard in the domestic circuit. He has a phenomenal record in first-class cricket, amassing 4,056 runs in 47 matches at an average of 68.74 while registering 14 hundreds and 13 half-centuries. Thus, his years of hard work was evident in his debut Test, in Rajkot, where he ended with 62 and 68*. However, he could not have the same impact in the following Test in Ranchi, where he only managed 14 runs overall. He will look to finish the series on a high with a big score in the fifth and final Test in Dharamsala with the series already in India's kitty. Rohit Sharma-led India lead the five Tests 3-1 following their five-wicket win in Ranchi. Ahead of the final Test, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced India's squad for the series finale. Vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah -- who was rested for the Ranchi clash -- has returned to the squad whereas KL Rahul remains unfit, having travelled to London to get an expert opinion on his injury.

Here is the match preview:Match 8 of the Women's Premier League (WPL) 2024 edition will see the UP Warriorz (UPW) take on the winless Gujarat Giants (GG) at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Friday evening (March 1). It is a clash of the two bottom-placed sides. Thus, two desperate teams will be eager to climb up the ladder in the table and expect the match to go down the wire. 

For UPW, they started their campaign with a nervy loss to the Smriti Mandhana-led Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCBW) before going down to the Delhi Capitals (DCW) convincingly. They, however, have revamped their run with a seven-wicket win over defending champions Mumbai Indians (MI). On the other hand, Giants have remained below par, as was the case for them in the inaugural edition. The Giants were completely outplayed by RCB as well as the MI camp. Their batting has been a big issue, posting below-par scores, whereas they have also not taken 10 wickets combined in the two games played. Thus, they need a whole lot to click for them to grab some points this evening. 

Match preview and result prediction: Chasing has been the flavour of the season so far. However, Thursday evening's game saw DC defend a big score versus RCB. Overall, the pitch will aid the new bowlers in the first innings but is expected to ease out as the game progresses. Thus, chasing will be fancied by both sides. For UP, who are doing marginally better than GG, they will depend on Kiran Navgire's form and their bowling attack, which has been reasonable, to earn back-to-back wins. Nonetheless, a desperate side like GG can be a slippery opponent for Alyssa Healy's side. Expect the chasing side to get past the line in a moderate-scoring encounter."

Red Bull have said the investigation report will remain confidential.McLaren and Mercedes bosses Zak Brown and Toto Wolff called on Formula One�s governing body to push Red Bull for greater transparency after an investigation cleared team principal Christian Horner of misconduct toward a female colleague.

Red Bull's parent company in Austria announced in a statement on Wednesday that the grievance against Horner, who denied the allegations, had been dismissed after a lengthy independent investigation. Red Bull have said the investigation report will remain confidential.

""I think the sanctioning body has a responsibility and authority to our sport, to our fans,"" Brown told reporters in a press conference organised by the governing FIA at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix on Thursday. ""So I think they need to make sure that things have been fully transparent with them. ""That�s what�s needed by those who run the sport to be really able to draw a line under it. ""Until then, I think there�ll continue to be some level of speculation by people and I don�t think that�s healthy for the sport.""Wolff, whose rivalry with Horner has provided much fodder for Netflix docu-series Drive to Survive, also emphasised the need for transparency. ""Eventually things are going to happen, and I think we have the duty, the organisation has the duty to say well we�ve looked at it, and it�s OK, and then we can move on,"" said the Austrian.Horner spoke to Sky Sports television briefly, as he walked through the Sakhir paddock, and said he was pleased the process was over. ""I obviously can't comment about it but here, very much the focus now on the grand prix and the season ahead and trying to defend both of our titles,"" he said.

Key paddock figures and permanently accredited journalists later received an email from an anonymous sender containing a link to material purported to be evidence submitted during the investigation.

""I won�t comment on anonymous speculation,"" Horner said in a subsequent statement. ""But to reiterate I have always denied the allegations. I respected the integrity of the independent investigation and fully co-operated with it every step of the way. ""It was a thorough and fair investigation conducted by an independent specialist barrister and it has concluded dismissing the complaint made. I remain fully focused on the start of the season."""

Sky Sport Italy and La Repubblica had reported that the sports prosecutor's request for a four-year ban was granted.

Juventus did not comment but a source confirmed the club was notified about the decision and would assess the next steps. The 30-year-old Pogba, who has denied any wrongdoing, has a contract at Juve until June 2026.""I have today been informed of the Tribunale Nazionale Antidoping's (NADO Italia) decision and believe that the verdict is incorrect,"" Pogba said in a statement. ""I am sad, shocked and heartbroken that everything I have built in my professional playing career has been taken away from me.

""As a consequence of the decision announced today, I will appeal this before the Court of Arbitration for Sport.""

Italy's national anti-doping organisation (NADO Italia) declined to comment on Pogba's case citing privacy rules.

Pogba was provisionally suspended by a NADO Italia tribunal in September after testing positive for testosterone - a banned substance and hormone that increases athletes' endurance.

The test, performed after Juve's 3-0 Serie A season-opening victory at Udinese on Aug. 20, detected testosterone, with the tribunal saying the results were consistent with an 'exogenous' (external) origin of the substance.

Pogba was an unused substitute in that game but he later made two appearances off the bench against Bologna and Empoli before he was handed a provisional suspension.Pogba's positive doping test was also confirmed in a counter-analysis on a second sample in October.

The ban could effectively end Pogba's career at the highest level, with the Frenchman -- who was among the sport's highest-earning players at his peak -- unable to return to action until September 2027 when he will be 34.

""When I am free of legal restrictions the full story will become clear, but I have never knowingly or deliberately taken any supplements that violate anti-doping regulations,"" Pogba added.

""As a professional athlete I would never do anything to enhance my performance by using banned substances and have never disrespected or cheated fellow athletes and supporters of any of the teams I have played for, or against.""

Pogba has had a torrid second spell with Juve due to injuries since he returned to the Turin-based club following his departure from Manchester United on a free transfer in 2022.

The 2018 World Cup winner barely featured last season due to knee and hamstring injuries as well as knee surgery, which prevented him playing for France at the World Cup in Qatar.

And this time Delhi, not Patiala, is the likely venue for the event due to the ongoing farmer�s protest in the country. 

Months after the ongoing saga surrounding the now-suspended WFI chief Brij Bhushan Singh, accused of sexual harassment by several female wrestlers, the senior national camp, on hold since January 2023, will get underway. 

The ad-hoc panel, formed to monitor daily activities at the WFI, began with the training camps for men (in Rohtak) and women (in Patiala) after conducting its own Nationals in Jaipur. Earlier, with the United World Wrestling (UWW) lifting WFI�s suspension after Sanjay Singh got elected as the new president, the WFI announced the trials to select the National teams for the Asian Wrestling Championships (in Bishkek from April 11-16) and the Continental Olympic Qualifier (from April 19-21).�After we conduct these trials, the top four in each category will be invited to be part of the National camp,'' WFI president Sanjay Singh told PTI. ''We have not yet finalised the venues for the camps,� he added.

Considering the farmer�s protest movement in Northen India, SAI centres in Sonipat are said to be used as venues for the men�s camp, while the IG Stadium will host the women�s camp.

''The Lucknow SAI centre is out of question, and we have to choose between Patiala and Delhi. As of today, the restriction on movement in and around of Punjab will make it a bit inconvenient for everyone to reach Patiala. So, probably, we can request the government to provide the IG Stadium for the women's camp,'' said a WFI source.

Who competes in the trials?
Per the source, the top four wrestlers at the recently concluded Nationals in Jaipur (conducted by the ad-hoc) and Pune (conducted by WFI), are invited to compete in the trials. All those who missed out on the cut either were not good or were not allowed to compete.

''We will invite not just the winners of the trials but also the finalists and the semi-finalists for the national camp. If the runner-up or number 3-4 are not interested, which happens sometimes, then that camp spot will be offered to the next best wrestler and so on,'' the source said.

This year is the first time the crabs have migrated as late as February since Parks Australia started tracking migration in the 1980s, he added.The migration sees the crabs journey from the interior of the island to the ocean, where they mate.

The flawless mission prompted the ISRO to virtually heave a sigh of relief over the challenging GSLV rocket technology, as the director of today's mission said the ""naughty boy has matured into an obedient, disciplined boy,"" apparently referring to its past unsuccessful missions.
ISRO Chairman S Somanath said the success gave the space agency ""greater confidence,"" as the GSLV will be next deployed in the NISAR mission, a collaborative effort with the US' NASA.
The INSAT-3DS satellite, weighing 2274 kg is a follow-on mission of the third generation meteorological satellite to be placed in a geostationary orbit and is funded by the Ministry of Earth Sciences.
The objective of the mission is to provide continuity of services to existing operational INSAT-3D (launched in 2013) and INSAT-3DR (September 2016) for enhanced meteorological observations, monitoring of land and ocean surfaces, weather forecast and disaster warning, as well as to provide satellite aided Search and Rescue Services (SAR) among others.
At the end of the 27.5 hour countdown, the nearly 52 metre tall GSLV-F14 lifted-off majestically from the second launch pad at this spaceport here, at a pre-fixed time of 5.35 pm.
The three stage rocket with a cryogenic upper stage, after a flight of about 20 minutes, got separated from the vehicle as planned and placed the satellite into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit.
Later, scientists at ISRO would undertake a series of manoeuvres to place the satellite into the Geo-stationary orbit in the coming days.
The rocket carries imager and sounder payloads, data relay transponders, satellite aided SAR transponders which would be used to study cloud properties, fog, rainfall, snow cover and depth, fire, smoke, land and ocean among others.The imager and sounder payloads incorporated in today's mission are similar to those carried by INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR, with significant improvements in radiometric performances, the space agency said.
INSAT stands for Indian National Satellite System.Somanath, also Secretary, Department of Space announced the successful accomplishment of the mission.

""The spacecraft has been injected into a very good orbit. The injection conditions were as expected and the vehicle has performed very very well...INSAT-3DS is the next generation weather satellite with improved capability over the existing INSAT series. This will augment the capability of observation of various atmospheric parameters that leads to information related to weather and climate,"" he said from the Mission Control Center here.Mission Director Tomy Joseph, referring to the GSLV said, ""the naughty boy has matured as a very obedient and disciplined boy."" ""Like PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle), GSLV has also become a robust vehicle for ISRO,"" he said, with his remarks prompting cheers and applause.Somanath added that with today's mission, ISRO's confidence on GSLV was ""further high."" ""As all of you know, the next mission of the GSLV is going to be the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite and this gives greater confidence,"" for the next mission, he said.
According to ISRO, NISAR is a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) observatory being jointly developed by NASA and the Indian space agency. NISAR will map the entire globe in 12 days and provide spatially and temporally consistent data for understanding changes in Earth's ecosystems, ice mass, vegetation biomass, sea level rise, ground water and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides.
Imteyaz Ahamed, Satellite Director of Saturday's mission said the payloads of INSAT-3DS have been significantly enhanced and the enhancements are in terms of configuration, content and capability resulting in increased imaging throughput.
The satellite was on its way to the destination, with the solar panels having been deployed. A series of orbit raising manoeuvres will be performed in the next few days followed by in orbit testing and commissioning of the spacecraft, Ahamed added.
Various departments of Ministry of Earth Sciences such as India Meteorological Department, National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, National Institute of Ocean Technology, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services and various agencies and institutes would benefit from the data provided by INSAT-3DS to provide improved weather forecasts and meteorological services, ISRO said.

The last launch of the GSLV, on May 29, 2023, was successful but the one before that �- on August 12, 2021 - was a failure.�In comparison, the GSLV's heavier cousin, the Launch Vehicle Mark-3 or the 'Bahubali rocket', has completed seven flights and has a cent-percent success record. The workhorse rocket of ISRO, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), also has an enviable 95 per cent success rate, with just three failures in 60 launches.The GSLV is a three-stage rocket that is 51.7 metres long - about a quarter of the length of the Statue of Unity, which stands 182 metres tall - and has a liftoff mass of 420 tonnes. The rocket uses an India-made cryogenic engine and ISRO plans to retire it after a few more launches.�The satellite being launched on Saturday is very special and is much needed as it will help boost India's weather and climate monitoring services. Called INSAT-3DS, it is a third-generation upgraded, dedicated meteorological satellite. The satellite weighs 2,274 kg and has been built at a cost of about ? 480 crore. It is fully funded by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, said ISRO.Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Department of Space can now only fly missions that are fully endorsed and supported by user agencies.�Better Forecasts, Saving LivesISRO officials said the new weather monitoring satellite is designed for enhanced meteorological observations and monitoring of land and ocean surfaces for weather forecasting and disaster warning. India has been using these eyes in the sky to help its weather office give increasingly accurate forecasts, which often help save lives.�""Indian weather satellites have been a game changer. Satellites are truly the eyes in the sky that have helped India forecast cyclones with great precision,"" said Dr M Ravichandran, an accomplished atmosphere and ocean science specialist, who is the secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences.�""Cyclones that originated in the Bay of Bengal during the 1970s led to fatalities of the order of 300,000 people. But this was before the Indian weather satellites came into existence. Now, with India using its own dedicated constellation of satellites, the cyclone forecast is so accurate that the death toll has dropped to double digits or, sometimes, to none at all.' �India currently has three operational weather satellites: INSAT-3D, INSAT-3DR, and OceanSat.Dr Ashim Kumar Mitra, project director of the Satellite Meteorology Division, India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, ""INSAT-3D is nearing its end-of-life period after having served since 2013, hence a replacement satellite was the need of the hour.""Explaining how weather satellites give data for forecasts, Dr Mitra said, ""Satellites basically measure the radiance coming from the Earth's surface and cloud tops. By making such measurements at appropriate wavelengths and applying physical and statistical techniques, it is possible to compute a wide range of products for weather monitoring and forecasting. Further, the satellite meteorological data on a global scale are vital inputs in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models as initial conditions.""""For a tropical country like India where high-impact convective events are very common, it is necessary to have good quality, high-density observations both on the spatial and temporal scale,"" he explained.�The new satellite also has a search-and-rescue transponder that helps pick distress signals from special equipment that is often carried by ships and even trekkers, helping locate them if they are lost in remote places or in distress.�PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comIndia being a tropical country where atmospheric variations are high, weather satellites are an essential tool for the IMD. ""All investments made in the Indian weather satellites have been paid back manifold,"" Mr Ravichandran asserted. �Now India has to wait and see if the ""naughty boy"" of ISRO has been duly tamed into obedience or it continues to be 'misbehaved'."

Find your way around with our tips on train tickets, bus services and accessible transportation.",The best ways to travel around in India,"India serves up travel on a massive scale.
The journey from northern Ladakh to the tip of Tamil Nadu covers 3214km (2000 miles), and it�s a 2933km (1822-mile) trip from the western edge of�Gujarat to the eastern border of Manipur in the Northeast States. Needless to say, getting from one end of this vast country to the other takes some time and effort.
Luckily, India�s magnificent rail network is on hand to do much of the heavy lifting, with more than 13,000 trains running daily on 68,103km (42,317 miles) of track, carrying a staggering 8 billion passengers per year. Every journey by train is backed up by thousands of journeys by bus, 4WD, taxi and rickshaw, and planes connect every corner of the country, from the beach resorts of Goa and Kerala to tiny mountain airstrips high in the Himalayas.
Whether you�re making plans for the plains or getting high in the hills, here�s our guide to getting around India.
The best way to see India is by train � Philip Lee Harvey / Lonely Planet
Taking the train in India is one of Asia�s most evocative experiences
Traveling by train in India is by far the most atmospheric way to explore the country, even with aging facilities on some parts of India�s vast rail network. Trains connect almost every corner of the country, including several charmingly nostalgic �toy trains� that run high into the foothills on narrow-gauge tracks. Recently, high-speed, modern Vande Bharat trains have started appearing on routes between major cities, offering a step up in comfort and convenience.
Indian Railways operates almost all of the nation�s trains, which are identified by name and number, as well as by the category of service (express, passenger or mail). Express trains are best, as there are fewer stops at minor stations to slow things down; for fast journeys, seek out the Rajdhani Express trains that connect Delhi to other state capitals, or the Shatabdi Express and Duronto Express trains that zip between India�s largest cities.
Make sure you use the right train station; many cities have multiple stations � often a city and cantonment stop, from the days when trains served British army barracks as well as downtown hubs. Some journeys involve connections in small towns that you�ll only visit for as long as it takes to jump across the platform.
Choose your class and book your train ticket in advance
There are many different classes � air-con 1st class (1AC) is the cream of the crop, with two- or four-person berths featuring seats that convert into beds, compartments with lockable doors and food service delivered to your seat. Two- and three-tier air-con carriages (2AC and 3AC) are almost as comfortable; sleeper carriages are similar to 3AC, only with fans instead of air-con. All are great for overnight trips, saving the cost of a hotel room for a night in relative comfort.
Unreserved 2nd class is something of a free-for-all � incredibly cheap, incredibly crowded and best saved for short journeys in the countryside. For all reserved classes (sleeper and above), there are special quotas and waitlist booking systems that can get you a seat even when the train appears to be fully booked. Major stations have special booking offices for quota seats.
Train tickets are best booked in advance, either at stations or online. The online booking process via the official Indian Railways website is complicated, however � you need a mobile phone to set up an account, and international cards are not always accepted. It�s usually easier to book through local booking sites such as 12Go, Cleartrip and Make My Trip.
Tips for train travel in India: When booking a trip, you�ll need to know the train number and the names (or codes) for the start and end stations. Consult the hard-copy booklet Trains at a Glance (available from station bookstands), use the journey search engine on the Indian Railways website or visit Erail. The website Seat 61 is a treasure trove of information on Indian rail travel.
There are many different types of bus service to choose from in India � Ultimate Travel Photos / Shutterstock
Buses are the backbone of Indian travel
India has a huge and impressive bus network, operated by both state-owned and private bus companies, and buses run almost everywhere at almost any time of day or night. Even if you can�t get where you want to go directly, there�ll often be a bus going halfway, and another bus completing the journey.
Unless there is no other choice, night buses are best avoided since drivers often take advantage of the emptier roads to drive at reckless speeds. On any mountain journey, avoid sitting over the wheels or behind the rear axle, unless you want to be tossed around like spaghetti in a colander.
""Ordinary"" buses run by state bus companies and local private operators are super cheap, but they stop everywhere and admit passengers until even the aisles are full. The price increases for various classes of �deluxe� and �express� buses and goes even higher for �Volvo� or �2x2� buses with airplane-style reclining seats. Private companies tend to charge slightly higher fares than government buses. Note that the duration of any journey to or from a major city will largely be dictated by the traffic in town.
On many local services, every seat and every inch of space in the aisle will be filled with passengers. Make your way toward the doors before the bus reaches your stop to make sure you can disembark. Bags go under the bus or up on the roof (you�ll be expected to carry them up yourself via a ladder on the back of the bus). Keep bags locked, and be watchful at food and toilet stops.
If you�re traveling on from India, international buses run to Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Pakistan. The international bus services run by state governments are usually reliable, but be wary of �tourist buses� run by travel agencies: it�s not uncommon to be charged luxury bus fares for two local buses, one running on either side of the border.
Tips for bus travel in India: More comfortable classes of bus can usually be booked in advance at the bus station or through travel agencies. On local buses, someone will wander up and down the aisle collecting fares � don�t panic if the conductor doesn�t bring your change right away; this may only be handed over when you disembark. If your change doesn�t materialize, a gentle reminder is usually all it takes.
Shared 4WDs are particularly useful for reaching hill stations or the high valleys of the Himalayas � panoglobe / Shutterstock
Shared 4WDs are the best way to experience the Himalayas
While buses travel high into the mountains, you can also get around on an army of shared 4WDs, from venerable, British-colonial-era Land Rovers to muscly local 4WDs made by Tata and Maruti. They�re sometimes known as ""shared jeeps"" or ""Sumos"" (the brand name of one of India�s best-selling 4WDs). Drivers charge by the seat (the roomier seat beside the driver may cost extra), and vehicles leave when full � or you can charter the whole vehicle for an immediate departure.
Shared 4WDs are more expensive than buses � but not by that much � and are by far the easiest way to reach hill towns such as Darjeeling and Leh in Ladakh. Being smaller than buses, they�re able to squeeze around landslides and navigate dirt roads that are unsafe for buses because of flooding or snow.
Hiring a motorcycle or a car with a driver is a great way to explore
Few people self-drive rental cars in India, but it�s easy to find motorcycles and scooters for rent, including for long-distance trips across the Himalayas. Delhi�s Lalli Singh Adventures has decades of experience renting classic Royal Enfield motorcycles to riders attempting epic road-trip routes like the journey from Delhi to Ladakh. To ride a motorcycle in India, you�ll need an international driving permit, and when hiring by the day for local exploring, you may be asked to leave your passport as a deposit. Ride slowly and defensively, and always give way to larger vehicles.
If you don�t feel up to the challenging driving conditions, renting a car and driver is an easy alternative, and the cost can be very reasonable when shared between several people. Find vehicles for hire through travel agencies or at taxi stands operated by local driver collectives.
Many stands display printed lists of excursions with fixed prices, or you can arrange bespoke half-day, full-day and multiday trips. Ask what languages your driver speaks. For multiday trips, check that the price includes fuel and the driver�s food and accommodation (drivers will make their own eating and sleeping arrangements).
Taxis and rideshares are great for shorter distances
Taxis are found everywhere in India, and they can be hired for in-town rides, day trips and multiday journeys. However, some taxis are only permitted to operate in certain areas, so don�t expect every cab to be able to take you across state lines. As well as conventional cabs, rideshares can be summoned via the Uber, Ola, Lyft and Bla Bla Car apps.
Officially, taxis should use the meter, but many drivers refuse, so you�ll have to negotiate a fare before you set off. The taxis that loiter around tourist sites and train stations often overcharge, so flag down a moving cab to have a better chance of paying a fair rate. Prepaid taxi stands at major transport hubs offer cab rides at fixed prices.

Urban transport in India is cheap and frequent
Urban transport in India is provided by crowded city buses, taxis, rickshaws and auto-rickshaws, urban trains and � in some cities � clean, modern, air-conditioned metro systems. The metros in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kochi offer an easy way to explore these cities.
Cycle rickshaws and auto-rickshaws � small motorized vehicles with a cab and room for two or three passengers plus the driver � are the most popular form of transport for short trips in any Indian town. Auto-rickshaws have meters, though drivers are reluctant to use them. If you can�t get a metered ride, agree on a price with the driver at the start of the journey (unless you use the prepaid booking stands at major train stations and airports).
Tips for rickshaw travel: Don�t expect rickshaw walas (drivers) to have change for larger bills. Keep a stash of ?10, ?20 and ?50 notes handy so you always have change to pay the fare. Don�t be too ruthless when haggling over a fare � drivers are poorly paid, and a few extra rupees can make a big difference to their take-home wage.
Take a cruise along the rivers
Ferries run across many rivers in India, but point-to-point trips along rivers or the ocean seaboard are uncommon. Slow sea ferries also run to Lakshadweep and the Andaman Islands.
There are some wonderful luxury multiday cruise services along some of India�s major rivers, including evocative trips on the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers with Assam Bengal Navigation. In rural areas, look for delightful cross-river trips by wooden rowboat or coracle (a small, basket-like vessel) � including at the ruins of Hampi. In sacred towns all along the River Ganges, boaters offer their services for rowboat tours, most famously in Varanasi.
Domestic flights will save time, but not carbon
Once upon a time, domestic air travel in India was a dubious proposition, with unreliable schedules, aging aircraft and elevated US-dollar fares for non-Indian passengers. Since the liberalization of air travel in India in the 1990s, domestic aviation now offers bargain fares for online bookings with budget airlines that bring cheap air travel to the masses.
Given its environmental impact and the many inexpensive alternatives, a lot of travelers are happy not to fly around India. However, a short flight can be a good way to avoid overland travel through areas with poor security (for example, in Kashmir and the Northeast States), or save days of rough travel in ancient 4WDs that aren�t exactly paragons of safety or environmental friendliness themselves.
If you want to fly sparingly, save internal flights for trips into the Himalayas � the flights to Leh in Ladakh and Pakyong in Sikkim rank among the world�s most spectacular air routes, with dizzying views of the tallest mountains on earth. With heavy competition, airlines come and go:�Air India, Indigo, SpiceJet and Air Asia India are presently the biggest carriers.
Buses are routinely overcrowded making them very challenging for people with mobility issues � Dinodia Photo / Getty Images
Accessible transportation is very limited in India
India can be a challenging destination for travelers with mobility issues. While locals are extremely helpful, infrastructure is variable, and the crowds can make it tricky to explore. Having a companion will always be an advantage.
Wheelchair users and the mobility impaired face particular challenges � where pavements are found, they are often potholed and uneven and frequently full of people and vendors. Using the road instead can be dangerous because of speeding vehicles; take extra care when crossing the road as crossing signals are often ignored. Also, be wary of sidewalks made from concrete slabs laid over open drains � these are often wobbly or broken.
Steps, stairs and a general absence of ramps are further obstacles. Where hotels and other buildings have elevators, these sometimes only stop at mezzanine levels between floors, rendering them somewhat redundant. Upmarket hotels are more likely to have proper elevators and fully accessible rooms with bathrooms that will fit a wheelchair.
With the number of small steps and curbs to navigate, a folding manual chair is an easier option than an electric chair. If you charter a car or 4WD with a driver, you may be able to explore in comparative comfort, but note that in some cities, the boot of taxis is filled by an LPG/CNG tank, leaving no space for a folding wheelchair.
India�s buses and trains make little accommodation for travelers with disabilities. Among other things, they tend to be filled to capacity, providing a serious challenge for the mobility impaired. If you travel by train, staff can help you board and disembark, but it�s best to stick to the roomier air-con classes. The IRCTC offers an ""e-wheelchair"" service at select train stations. Many agencies offer specialist tours for travelers with disabilities, including Royal Indian Voyages, Disabled Holidays and Enable Holidays.

Here's our guide to the best hikes in India.","The 12 best hikes in India, from the high Himalayas to the steamy Western Ghats","From towering Himalayan peaks to vast expanses of grassland and the steamy hills of the Western Ghats, India offers a diversity of hiking experiences like nowhere else on Earth.

Whether you fancy a short trek through the hills or an epic expedition over the high passes of the Himalayas, you'll find a route with your name on it. Many shorter walks in India can be undertaken without a guide, including some of the country's most important pilgrimage treks. For high-altitude hikes, local guides are easy to find in trail hubs.

From easy day jaunts to multi-day adventures, here's our pick of the best hikes in India.

Chembra Peak, Kerala

Best hike in the Western Ghats

7km (4.3 miles) round trip, 5 hours, easy to moderate

Located 90km northeast of Kozhikode, 2,100m (6,890ft) Chembra Peak is the tallest summit in Kerala, and it�s an easy day hike to reach the summit. A well-marked and charming trail passes through thick forest, rolling tea gardens and scented coffee and spice estates rich with aromatic bouquets of pepper and cardamom. Around halfway up you'll find a heart-shaped lake, but continue to the top for gorgeous views over the lush green hills of the Western Ghats.

This mountainous region teems with biodiversity, preserving more than 300 threatened species of flora and fauna. Trekkers should keep an eye out for endemic wildflowers and the lucky sightings of wild Asian elephants, lion-tailed macaques, Malabar hornbills or Nilgiri tahr (a sheep-like wild ungulate).

The trail to Chembra starts at the small village of Meppadi near Kalpetta, and it pays to get an early start as overnight stays are prohibited and only 200 hiking permits are issued per day. You'll need to register with the local forest office in the village; the trail opens at 7am. Avoid this trek during the monsoon season when paths turn to mud.

Deoria Tal and Chandrashila Trek, Uttarakhand

Best hike for winter scenery

18�20km (11�12 miles) round trip, 2 days, easy to moderate

Reflecting snow-cloaked Himalayan peaks in its placid waters, Deoria Tal � literally, ""the bathing place of the gods"" � is a beautiful lake about 14km (8.7 miles) east of Ukhimath in the foothills of Uttarakhand, northeast of Delhi. The views towards�7,138m (23,419ft) Mt Chaukhamba are particularly impressive.

Accessible year-round, the trail to Deoria Tal starts at the pretty village of Sari and it's easy to follow without a guide, making this a great Himalayan hike for independent trekkers. Though it climbs steeply uphill, the route is fairly straightforward, following a well-maintained path surrounded by rhododendron trees that bloom with bright pink flowers in spring. It is possible to camp overnight near the lake, but the hike can also be completed as a day trip.

Better still, it can be tied in with a trek to the top of 3,690m (12,110ft)�Chandrashila, the ridge that rises above Tungnath Mandir. From Sari, it�s only 20km (12 miles) to the tiny village of Chopta, the trailhead for the pilgrim trek to the world�s highest Shiva temple. After walking the 4km (2.5 miles) to the temple, you can continue to the top of Chandrashila for astounding 360-degree views of surrounding peaks including 7,816m (25,643ft) Nanda Devi, India's second-highest peak.

Logistics are easy for the Tungnath hike � a multitude of small stalls along the trail serve basic Indian food and hot cups of chai (sweet Indian tea). On your way down, keep an eye out for the colorful Himalayan Monal pheasant, the state bird of Uttarakhand.

Treks in Sikkim pass close to mighty Khangchendzonga, the third-highest mountain on the planet � Flickr Open / Getty ImagesGoecha La Trek, Sikkim

Best high-altitude hike for adventurers

91km (57 miles), 10 days, difficult

You will need to book with a trekking agency (like Travel Gangtok Tourism) to attempt the challenging Goecha La hike, but for many hikers this is the highlight of a visit to the former Buddhist kingdom of Sikkim. The effort is well worth it for the giddying views, which include sweeping vistas across northeast India and unmatched opportunities for photos of 8,586m (28,169ft) Khangchendzonga, the world�s third-highest mountain.

Don't be fooled by the trail's unassuming start in the quiet village of Yuksom, the site of Sikkim�s first capital�Rabdentse (the ruins of which can be seen just outside the village). After a gentle beginning, the trail becomes increasingly strenuous as you gain altitude. This trek climbs to 4,940m (16,207ft) at the Goecha pass, so you should take time to acclimatize to reduce the risk of Acute Mountain Sickness.

The route cuts through Khangchendzonga National Park � a sacred site for the Lepcha tribe, the original inhabitants of Sikkim who worship Mt Khangchendzonga as a deity. While you walk, look out for Buddhist chortens (stupas), rhododendrons, mountain ferns and hot springs. You may get lucky and spot red pandas, musk deer, blue sheep and blood pheasants on high-altitude sections of the trail.

The spring and fall months (just before and after the summer monsoon) are the best times to attempt this hike. Rise before daybreak for the side-hike to 4,000m (13,123ft) Dzongri peak on day four of the trek and you'll be rewarded by a gorgeous sunrise over Khangchendzonga.

Triund trek, Himachal Pradesh

Best easy trek for beginners

11.5 km (7 miles) round trip, 6-7 hours, easy

An excellent Himalayan hike for beginners, the Triund trek follows a well-used shepherds' trail that is accessible throughout the year. The path begins at the Galu temple in Dharamkot, a popular backpacker hangout just north of McLeod Ganj, seat of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile. Buses run uphill to McLeod Ganj from the transit town of Dharamshala further down the valley.

You can start this walk from either Dharamkot or McLeod Ganj. The pretty path climbs uphill through a mix of deodar, pine, rhododendron and oak forests with sweeping views along the valley. The sunset views from the ridge at�Triund � set at 2,850m (9,350ft) � are especially grand, filling the sky with vivid pinks, yellows and oranges.

Although many hikers complete the Triund trek in a day, tents, sleeping bags and food are available at the summit campsite should you want to spend the night gazing at the stars and watching the twinkling lights below in the Kangra Valley.�

Treks through the high-altitude deserts of Ladakh start almost on the city limits of Leh  � Rosliak Oleksandr / ShutterstockMarkha Valley Trek, Ladakh

Best high-altitude desert hike

65km (40 miles), 6-7 days, moderate to difficult

Traversing the high-altitude deserts of Ladakh, the trek to the Markha Valley is a tea-house trail that�s hugely popular with independent hikers. With overnight stops in warm village homestays instead of chilly tents, the trek's great lure is the chance to immerse yourself in Ladakhi culture. This trek also cuts through the heart of Hemis National Park, home to rare Himalayan animals such as blue sheep, snow leopards and Tibetan red foxes, plus legions of cute Himalayan marmots.

Starting with a short bus ride from Leh, the route can be followed without a guide, though local trekking agencies can arrange a supported trip with guides and porters. The hike is best attempted in July or August when the villages along the route resemble green oases with crops growing up between the whitewashed homes and ancient Buddhist monasteries.

Hikers will need to be well-acclimatized as the trail crosses a 5,200m (17,060ft) pass. If you've traveled to Leh by air, or come up quickly from the plains, spend a few days in the Ladakhi capital before attempting this trek. Although it's quite possible to complete the route independently, there are a few tricky sections to overcome � including a waist-deep crossing of the Markha River and some rocky canyons where you need to watch your footing.

As this is a circular route, every day offers a different experience. Starting from the village of Chilling and looping southeast to Sumdo, you can tack on a visit to the stunning gompa (Buddhist monastery) at Hemis before you head back to Leh. Parts of the Markha Valley can also be trekked in winter, when there is a greater chance of spotting a snow leopard.

Kashmir Great Lakes Trek, Kashmir

Best hike for alpine scenery

74km (46 miles), 7 days, moderate

One of India�s finest treks, this week-long tour of the legendary Kashmir Valley takes in seven gorgeous glacial lakes, set amongst wildflower meadows crisscrossed by clear streams and lorded over by snowy mountains. Fed by snowmelt, these serene and silent bodies of water look almost impossibly beautiful in their different shades of turquoise and aquamarine.

As with any trip to Kashmir, it pays to check the security situation before traveling to Srinagar as unrest periodically causes problems for travel. Sharing the trekking path with goat herders and semi-nomadic sheep, this is a once-in-a-lifetime hike. Camping is permitted next to some of the lakes, and waking up here at first light is a fabulous introduction to the raw beauty of the famed vale of Kashmir.

Starting at the village of Sitkadi near Sonamarg, about 81km (50 miles) east of Srinagar, this is a moderate hike by Himalayan standards. The trail tops out at a 4,220m (13,845ft) pass, which you cross on the fourth day, and passes through stunning and varied alpine scenery. Join a small trekking group with a local agency � Indiahikes and Trek the Himalayas can take care of the logistics.

The living root bridges of Meghalaya are a remarkable feat of engineering � Mazur Travel / ShutterstockNongriat Trek, Meghalaya

Best hike to learn about Indigenous culture

7km (4.3 miles) round trip, 1 day, moderate� 

The lofty plateau of Meghalaya is a place of folklore and legends, hidden valleys, natural pools and more waterfalls than you can count. But it�s the living root bridges created by generations of Khasi villagers in the hills around Nongriat that attract most visitors. Formed by weaving together tree roots and branches, these natural suspension bridges are an impressive example of ancient engineering know-how.

The trail to Nongriat starts in the village of Tyrna, near Cherrapunji � once listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the wettest place on earth. Buses run regularly to Cherrapunji from Shillong, Meghalaya's fascinating hill station capital. To reach the living root bridges, you must make a steep descent over 3,500 stone steps and creep through dense areas of rainforest teeming with butterflies, moths and jungle insects.

There are a few basic shops at the midpoint of the trail for provisions, but it's best to come with a local guide (book in Shillong or Cherrapunji). Pack a rain jacket, waterproof shoes and a bag cover � it rains profusely in this region. It's possible to sleep overnight in a homestay in Nongriat, continuing the next morning to the pretty Rainbow Waterfall.

Valley of Flowers Trek, Uttarakhand

Best hike for flower enthusiasts�

15�25 km (9�15.5 miles) round trip, 7-10 hours or several days, moderate 

One of India's most popular hiking destinations, Uttarakhand's Valley of Flowers takes its name from the astonishing array of colorful wildflowers that bloom toward the end of the monsoon season in this lofty national park. This protected area is also home to Asiatic black bears, brown bears and snow leopards, though sightings are rare.

The starting point for treks is the town of Govindghat, on the highway between�Joshimath and the revered Hindu temple at Badrinath. From here, it�s an easy 14km (8.7 mile) hike to Ghangaria, where most hikers spend the night before heading into the valley itself.

Start off early from your guesthouse to reach the entrance to the valley by 7am when the route opens � the last trekkers are admitted at noon. Alternatively, you can follow the 6km (3.7 mile) trail used by Sikh pilgrims to reach Hemkund Sahib, a remote gurdwara (Sikh temple) built beside a stunning alpine lake.

The trek to the Hampta Pass takes in classic Himalayan landscapes � muhd fuad abd rahim / ShutterstockHampta Pass trek, Himachal Pradesh

Best multi-day hike

21km (13 miles), 5 days, easy-moderate

Originally a shepherd trail and nomadic trade route, this stirring hike takes you from the lush green meadows of the Kullu Valley across the 4,270m (14,009ft) Hampta Pass, and on to the rugged landscapes of Lahaul � an ancient Hindu and Buddhist valley that serves as a back route to Ladakh.�

The trailhead for this multi-day hike is Jobra, a two-hour drive from the hill resort of Manali. You'll quickly leave civilization behind as you march through mixed forests of birch, deodar and oak, interspersed by glacial streams and dazzling green meadows carpeted with wildflowers.

The panoramic views of the Lahaul Valley from the top of the pass are highly memorable (bring an extra camera memory card). The hike ends in Chhatru, where a dirt track leads to Chandra Taal (Moon Lake), a scenic lake located at an altitude of 4,250m (13,944ft).�

Tadiandamol trek, Karnataka

Best trek in South India�

12km (7.5 miles) round trip, 7�9 hours, easy

The highest buttress in the green rolling hills of the Kodagu region � famed for producing India's best coffee � Tadiandamol makes for an ideal day hike for trekkers who want to gaze at misty green hills painted by swirls of cloud. Starting at Nalakunad Palace, around three hours from Mysuru, the route cuts through the Brahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuary, a protected area of stunted tropical shola forests, beautiful grasslands and tinkling streams.

With views over coffee estates that also raise spices such as pepper, areca nut and nutmeg, this is a well-marked, moderate hike and it's easy to complete without a guide. The best time to hike here is from September to March.

Best spiritual hike�

36km (22 miles) round trip, 2-3 days, moderate 

Many of India's most interesting hikes follow ancient pilgrimage routes, and this trek to one of the sources of the River Ganges is one of the oldest hikes in the country. The endpoint, Gaumukh (literally, Cow�s Mouth) is a massive glacier high in the Himalayas, and its meltwater gives birth to India's most sacred river. Stupendous nighttime views of the pointy summit of 6,543m (21,467ft) Mt Shivling surrounded by a million twinkling stars only add to the magic.

The trek starts in the pilgrim town of Gangotri, home to one of the revered Char Dham � four of the most sacred Hindu temples in India. The hike is moderately difficult, with a gentle but sustained climb through increasingly rugged scenery. Most people spend the night at Bhojbasa, 3km (1.9 miles) before Gaumukh, where there are tents and a tourist rest house along with basic facilities such as toilets and food stalls.

Khaliya Top, Uttarakhand�

Best day hike for Himalayan views

14km (8.7 miles) round trip, (1-2 days), moderate

Set at 3,600m (11,811ft), Khaliya Top is an alpine meadow that sits proudly amongst the peaks of the Kumaon Himalaya in Uttarakhand, offering 360-degree views of an amphitheater of snow-capped mountains. After leaving the Balati Bend forest office, 8km (5 miles) from Munsyari, you'll immediately enter a dense forest of rhododendrons and oak trees before rising onto exposed hillsides.

The trail is well-marked, with sharp ascents in places. Clear views of the Panchachuli and Nanda Devi ranges become visible as you climb higher on the trail, and the views just keep getting better as you approach the KMVN rest house just before Khaliya Top. Take a packed lunch to enjoy while you gasp at the views.

Hiking is well-established in India, but here are some tips for first-timers.

When is the hiking season?

Due to the vastness of India, you should be able to find somewhere to hike in the country whenever you visit. While the dry months from October to May are all fine for trekking, March to May is the peak hiking season in the Himalayan foothills. The high-altitude valleys of Ladakh are best visited from June to September, when the snows melt and the road opens from Himachal Pradesh.

At any time of year, hikers should pack for all conditions as the weather can change in an instant in the mountains � something that is being exacerbated by climate change. Rainfall patterns are more unstable than they were and higher temperatures are melting some glaciers.

There is usually snow from November to March, making for challenging trekking conditions. Avoid Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and the area around Darjeeling in July and August, when heavy monsoon rains can cause landslides that wash away roads and trails.

What are the best maps to use for hiking?

Thanks to the efforts of Peter Van Geit, the Belgian-born founder of the Chennai Trekking Club, it is finally possible to get hold of decent quality maps of the Indian Himalayas. His Ultra Journeys maps are very recent and can be downloaded for free.

A number of useful digital maps can be downloaded offline and uploaded onto your smartphone or GPS. Gaia GPS and Alltrails produce some useful terrain maps of India, marking trekking trails (where they exist). Hikers will need a subscription to use these services.

Leomann Maps is excellent for Kashmir, Ladakh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. Hard copies can be bought online and at some bookstores. Olizane produces some super hiking maps for Ladakh and Zanskar region, while Indiahikes has GPS files available to download for treks in the Western Ghats.

How to find a reputable trekking guide

Finding a good, experienced trekking guide is the best investment you�ll make during a trip to India. The Indian Mountaineering Foundation, based in Delhi, keeps a list of registered tour operators across the country.

Look for a company whose trek leaders are qualified in mountaineering and certified Wilderness First Aid Responders. It�s also worth checking what equipment they carry on their treks � on high-altitude routes, oxygen cylinders and first aid kits should always be included.

You will need to pack clothes that can withstand the mountain weather, which can change quickly. That means a wind-proof layer and a down jacket, as well as a waterproof coat. Wear your hiking boots before you hit the trails and invest in a decent map � many of the maps available locally are unreliable for more remote regions.

Always carry water (or the means of purifying water), extra socks, a survival bag and emergency food. Sunscreen, a high-UV-factor chapstick, a sunhat and sunglasses should also be seen as essentials � it's easy to get sunburned at altitude and the snow can be blindingly white at times. For a multi-day hike, consider bringing your own sleeping bag and roll mat; some trekking companies can provide these, but quality varies.

Check to see if you need any permits to trek in the Himalayas

Before you set off, check if you need a permit to hike. Special permits are needed to enter areas close to India's borders, particularly in the northeast of the country. Those hiking in any part of Arunachal Pradesh and in specific areas in Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Sikkim and Uttarakhand will need to apply for a General Protected Area Permit.

Permits are usually arranged through a local trekking agent or travel agency, and you need to be traveling with at least one other person to obtain one. Contact agencies ahead of time to make arrangements. Permits are usually valid for 10 days with an option to extend for an additional week. Indian citizens will need an Inner Line Permit, which can be organized through the local state government.

How to acclimatize for a mountain trek

Avoid driving as high as you can and setting off from there. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a serious risk above 2,500m (8,200ft), and can be fatal. On any high-altitude trek, ascend slowly, avoid alcohol and other diuretics, drink lots of water and take regular rest days to acclimatize as you gain elevation. If you are coming up to the mountains from a lower elevation, spend a few days letting your body acclimatize before heading out on a trek.

During the trek, if you show any symptoms of AMS � these include light-headedness, tiredness, nausea, a rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, headaches or trouble sleeping � do not climb any higher. If symptoms get worse, descend immediately. At night, aim to sleep at a lower elevation than the highest point reached on that day, and try to avoid sleeping at an elevation more than 500m (1,640ft) above the elevation where you spent the previous night."

Make it easier with our tips on what you need to know before you go.,22 things you need to know before visiting India,"India is a place that overwhelms your senses in the best possible way � nowhere else delivers quite the same barrage of sights, sounds and sensations as this continent-sized country at the heart of Asia.
It would take a lifetime to see all of India, let alone understand every nuance and facet of this nation of 1.4 billion inhabitants. But with a little preparation, you can learn to navigate the richness of this country, from its snow-capped peaks and velvety beaches to its historic temples and luxuriant palaces.
We've collated the top things you need to know about visiting India, but the journey begins before you leave home. Apply for your Indian visa online for a smooth arrival on the subcontinent. Read on for 22 more insider tips that will help make your vacation unforgettable.
1. Plan your trip around the seasons
India has a reputation for being hot and humid, but with beaches, mountains, hills, coastlines and plains all jammed into a relatively small geographical area, the climate is quite diverse. The southwest monsoon brings rainy weather to most of the country from June to September, but this is the best time of year to visit the high-altitude deserts of Ladakh, although depending on the route you take, you risk encountering landslides and floods.
In the far south, there�s also a milder rainy season from October to December. The ideal weather window for travel is from October to May, though temperatures and humidity climb to agonizing levels from March onwards in the run-up to the monsoon. If you find yourself in India in the spring, head to the Himalayan foothills for milder temperatures and good trekking conditions.
2. Get your jabs before you travel
There is no official requirement for vaccinations to enter India (although yellow fever vaccination is needed if you are traveling from a country where the disease is endemic).
That said, it is important that you contact a health professional at least eight weeks before you travel to ensure your jabs are up to date. Vaccinations for diphtheria and tetanus, hepatitis A and B, polio and typhoid are usually recommended, on top of childhood vaccinations for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella.
Vaccinations worth considering for longer trips include Japanese B encephalitis, meningitis and rabies. Monkeys, dogs and cats can all carry the rabies parasite, and infection is fatal if untreated.

3. Take malaria precautions
Depending on where in India you are traveling to, you may want to speak to your healthcare provider about taking a course of anti-malarial tablets. For instance, northeastern and eastern parts of India, as well as the city of Mangalore, have a higher malaria risk.
Always take precautions to avoid mosquito bites � this will also help you avoid dengue fever, a viral infection that is transmitted by mosquitoes to humans. Sleeping under a mosquito net, wearing long sleeves and trousers in light colors, and using a repellent and/or a plug-in mosquito killer with a high concentration of DEET (diethyltoluamide) is advisable.
4. Get insured
Travel insurance is essential for India. Depending on where you travel to, you may find public hospitals are poorly equipped. Additionally, most private clinics and hospitals require payment ahead of treatment. Make sure you are covered for emergency evacuation and also for any adventure activities you plan to get involved in.
If you�re unlucky enough to be a victim of crime, contact the local police station or dial 100 or 112, the national emergency number. You�ll need to get the police to file a report (a �FIR"" � First Information Report) to make a claim on your travel insurance.
5. Book ahead for busy times and festivals
India can get very busy from November to February, so affordable accommodation is usually swamped in peak season. It�s a good idea to book ahead, either directly with the venues or via booking aggregator sites such as Agoda and MakeMyTrip.
Also, book train tickets in advance where possible, particularly for popular routes. Tickets can be booked (with a fair amount of hassle) via the government booking site IRCTC or more easily through local booking sites such as 12Go or Cleartrip.
6. Plan your comms before you travel
Many things in India (including train bookings or ordering food online) get easier if you have a local SIM card. Bring an unlocked phone from home (or pick one up locally) and get a phone shop to sign you up for a local pay-as-you-go SIM package on arrival. You�ll need to bring passport photos and photocopies of your passport ID pages to complete the application.

7. Check your lunar calendars
While India officially follows the Gregorian calendar, the major festivals for Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Islam and several other religions follow lunar calendars and fall on different dates from year to year. Always check festival dates before you book your trip (bearing in mind these dates are subject to change); the Indian government maintains a useful online list of public holidays.
8. Learn local etiquette
English is the�lingua franca in most metropolitan areas in India, and you�ll get away with polite hellos, goodbyes and thank yous in smaller towns too. However, if you�re traveling in northern India, you can say ""namaste"" (I bow to you) with your hands together in a prayer-like gesture in front of your chest. Similarly, when meeting Muslims in north India, you can say ""salaam alaikum"" (peace be with you) � the correct response is ""alaikum salaam."" Most of the time, it�s the effort that�s welcomed over pronunciation, so don�t be shy!
Shaking hands is a standard business greeting between men, but outside metropolitan regions, men and women rarely shake. Only ever use your right hand. The same rule applies when passing things to people � including money.
If you get invited to someone�s home, bring a small gift (flowers or sweets are always a safe bet) and remove your shoes before entering. It�s polite to eat and drink what you are offered, even if you don�t really fancy it.
9. Dress modestly
Depending on where in India you are, modesty is taken seriously � especially for women. Travelers of any gender will have an easier time if they wear loose-fitting clothing that covers their legs and arms. Swimwear is only appropriate for the beach � although it is not uncommon to see locals swim fully clothed. To fit in, consider investing in a kurta pyjama (a traditional garment resembling a long shirt and loose trousers for men) or a salwar kameez (a long shirt, loose trousers and scarf for women).
10. What to eat and how to eat it
Many religions in India have their own dietary rules. Muslims avoid pork, many Hindus avoid beef, and some Hindus and Buddhists are vegetarian or vegan. Many Jains are vegetarians who avoid some vegetables (most notably onions, garlic and potatoes) and who try to avoid causing harm to all living creatures. These rules mean vegan and vegetarian food is often easy to find in India.
Eating with your hands is the norm in many restaurants, particularly in parts of southern India. Take your cue from other patrons in the restaurant, and remember to eat with your right hand. Mix rice and curry into balls with your fingers and push it into your mouth with your thumb. Some thalis (plate meals consisting of multiple dishes served in tandem) are served not on a plate but on a washed and flash-heated banana leaf.
11. Haggling is not a game of life and death
Haggling for a fair price when buying things � in street stalls and open-air markets � is a way of life in India. Although it can sometimes be a frustrating experience, losing your temper is extremely bad form � if you can�t agree on a price with the vendor that you are both happy with, politely decline and shop somewhere else.
The rules of the game are as follows. The vendor will quote you a price that is more than the item is worth, then you�ll come back with a counter-offer, working up from there until you reach a mutually agreeable figure.
The �walking away� trick may bring a few last-minute adjustments, but before long, you�ll reach a threshold that the vendor won�t go below. Throwing in extra items may bring a discount on the overall cost. Many travelers prefer not to haggle in places where the money goes directly to artisans.

12. Respect etiquette at religious sites
Religion is taken very seriously in India, so it pays to know the rules and expectations for visits to temples, mosques, monasteries, gurdwaras (Sikh shrines), synagogues and churches. Always check if you are allowed to enter � some temples and mosques are closed to people who don�t follow the faith. Mosques may also be closed to visitors during prayers or on Fridays.
If asked to do so, remove your shoes before entering any religious building, and be prepared to cover your head with a scarf or shawl. Generally, always cover your legs and arms (a sarong can be handy as an emergency cover-all). Some temples also ban leather goods, and many religious sites do not allow photography.
Avoid pointing the soles of your feet towards a person or deity � this is considered disrespectful. The same goes for touching any person or effigy on the head. It is conventional to walk around Buddhist and Hindu shrines in a clockwise direction, in a ceremonial circuit known as a parikrama.
Making an offering or leaving a donation is often expected � locals always offer something, but be wary of people waving receipts showing huge donations. Giving something is appropriate, but don�t feel pressured into leaving large sums.
13. Giving alms is common but up to you
The giving of alms has a long history in India, and foreigners can expect to be approached regularly with requests for money. Whether you give or not is a personal choice, but many Indians give on a daily basis, particularly when visiting temples and mosques. Be aware that some requests for money will be scams, and you may be able to do more good by giving your time or cash to charity or aid organizations you�ve taken time to research, rather than handing out cash.
14. Respect local social attitudes
India has complex social rules about respect for elders. Depending on where you are traveling to, older people are often greeted with the honorific �auntie� or �uncle,� and the ending ji may also be added to someone�s name as a sign of respect.
Outside bigger cities, India can be quite conservative when it comes to interactions between unmarried men and women. Also, most parts of India are conservative when it comes to same-sex relationships. Whatever your sexuality, it�s best to avoid public displays of affection.
15. Street harassment is unfortunately common
Although harassment can happen anywhere, parts of India are constantly in the news owing to a lack of women�s safety. Beyond long, unwelcome stares and persistent attempts to start a conversation, more serious assaults are also a risk. Groping is common in crowds (particularly during festivals).
Exercise caution like you would anywhere else, and remain alert. Never get into a taxi or auto rickshaw containing anyone other than the driver, and avoid walking alone in quiet areas, particularly at night. Decline offers of food or drinks from strangers.
If traveling by public transport as a woman, it's best to seek out train carriages and designated seating reserved for women. Wearing a wedding ring (even if not married) and using dark sunglasses and headphones can buy you some privacy on public transport. If you are being hassled, drawing loud attention to the intrusion may encourage others to come to your aid.
16. Keep track of security situations in India
India has seen deadly attacks by separatist and Marxist groups and Kashmiri insurgents. Monitor the local news and be alert for suspicious behavior, particularly around major tourist sites. Always check the security situation before traveling to Srinagar and the Kashmir Valley in case of flare-ups of unrest. Strikes, demonstrations and protests are also best avoided, as violence is a risk. It goes without saying but in the event of trouble, obey local curfews and stay inside � your hotel is probably the safest place to be.

17. Take the altitude seriously when hiking
Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a risk when traveling above 2500m (8202ft), which covers most of the Indian Himalayas. AMS can be fatal, so always ascend slowly and take rest days to allow your body to acclimate to significant elevation changes. If you begin to feel ill while hiking in the mountains, stop, and if your symptoms don�t improve, descend immediately.
18. Familiarize yourself with local rules and regulations
India has a few laws and regulations that visitors might be unfamiliar with. For instance, taking photographs of bridges, the periphery of military camps and border crossings � or flying drones over them � is considered a serious security issue.
When traveling by plane internally in India, you may be asked to surrender batteries from devices in your cabin bags. Smoking is banned in most public places, and a few states also have bans on the consumption of beef � killing or injuring a cow in a road accident, even accidentally, can lead to violent reprisals.
To avoid sticky situations, take the time to research where you�re going, and talk to staff at your hotel or hostel or your B&B host for advice on things to be aware of.
19. Steer clear of drugs
India may have a reputation amongst travelers as a place to push boundaries, but its drug laws are strict. Possessing even small amounts of drugs for personal use can lead to a prison sentence.
Some religious groups are permitted to consume marijuana for ceremonial purposes, but that often doesn�t extend to tourists. You can, however, find bhaang � a marijuana mixture made with the leaves (rather than the bud) of the cannabis plant � at government-approved bhaang shops.
20. Avoid the tap water
The tap water in India is not potable. Drinking or brushing your teeth with it can be a fast track to stomach troubles � the most common illness tourists experience in India. Stick to purified or bottled water (or even better, purify your own to avoid contributing to India�s plastic waste mountain).
The water rule extends to ice (be wary of ice in drinks and ice cream) and to uncooked foods, particularly salads and dishes such as coriander chutneys, which may have been washed with contaminated water. When eating fruit, stick to things you can peel or wash thoroughly yourself, and be cautious of freshly prepared juices. Hot drinks are generally fine, so drink your fill of chai (milky tea, often spiced and sweet).

21. Watch local news to keep track of natural disasters
Some geographical areas in India are prone to natural disasters, and the risk is higher in certain seasons. Hilly areas of Himachal Pradesh, for instance, often see flash flooding and landslides during the monsoon. Be alert to signs of natural disasters and keep an eye on the local news so you know which areas to avoid. Follow the Indian Meteorological Department�s website as well as their social media handle for timely updates.
If you are caught up in a natural disaster, follow the advice of emergency workers and try to leave the area quickly.
22. Spot the scams
India has a reputation for scams designed to separate tourists from their money, and touts and confidence tricksters can often be found where tourists gather. Get tourist information and make bookings at official offices, rather than �tourist offices� you have been led to by people offering unsolicited help.
If anyone steers you to a hotel, shop or other establishment without you asking, they may be angling for a commission, which will be added to the price you pay. Be dubious of claims that the place you want to go is �closed� � always check yourself to be sure.
Exercise common sense and be wary of deals that sound too good to be true � for example, the gem scam, where travelers are tricked into buying worthless gems to �sell at a profit back home.�"
Travel,145,When is the best time to visit India?,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-time-to-visit-india,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2022-02/GettyRF_533327527.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,13-12-23,India is so vast that seasons mean different things from region to region. Here's all you need to know to plan your perfect trip.,When is the best time to visit India?,"India is a country that�s almost a continent. From the sky-high peaks of the Himalayas to the waterlogged jungles of Kerala and the dry-as-a-bone deserts of Gujarat and Rajasthan, this enormous nation covers an astonishing variety of terrain. There�s always somewhere worth visiting no matter what the weather is doing.
The northern hemisphere winter � from December to March � is the optimum time to visit the vibrant cities and historic temples and forts of north India, while the rainy monsoon period from June to September is peak season in the dry mountains of Ladakh.
However, even at the height of the rainy season, there are plenty of good reasons to visit this remarkable nation � not least the festival calendar, which is packed year-round. Here�s our guide to the best times to come to India.

December to March is best for beach days, tiger safaris and temple trips
The peak season for tourism in India coincides with dry skies and warm but not baking temperatures in the plains � in other words, perfect traveling weather. The balmy, sunny days are ideal for visiting India�s teeming cities, and most of the country is ripe for exploration, though it can be frosty in the foothills of the Himalayas.
Even in the steamy south, humidity hovers at manageable levels and temperatures dip overnight, making it easier to sleep, though this is also the time for peak prices almost everywhere. Another hassle is the morning fog, which can disrupt air travel and other forms of transport in the northern plains.
December to March is also the sweet spot for lowland adventures. National parks are drier, there�s less greenery for wildlife to hide behind, and animals are more active for longer thanks to the lower temperatures. For a good chance of tiger sightings, head to Kanha, Bandhavgarh, and other national parks in the central plains.
In the hills, it�s a slightly different story. While there�s an undeniable magic to seeing Shimla dusted with snow, many hotels shut their doors for the winter, and mountain trails and roads over high passes become obstructed, including the main roads to Ladakh (though some hardy travelers still fly in for winter treks). A handful of hill towns in Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand stay open for skiing and other winter sports.
December is a big time for Hindu marriage ceremonies � look out for�baraat (bridegroom�s processions) featuring a white horse, a nervous groom, and an ear-splitting marching band. Christian communities in Goa and parts of Kerala and the Northeast States hang up decorations in the lead-up to Christmas, and Christmas Day is celebrated with feasting and fireworks.

In January, all eyes are on Delhi for the pomp and circumstance of Republic Day on January 26 (don�t miss the army and police motorcycle stunt teams). The Hindu festival of Sankranti is celebrated in different ways across India, from special celebrations to honor cows in South India to mass kite-flying in Gujarat. (If you'd like to participate in kite-flying, you can help to avoid causing harm to birds and other wildlife by choosing a kite with a plain cotton � not synthetic � string and by avoiding early morning and evening when the birds are likely to be flying in great numbers.)
If you come in February, head to Jaipur for the cultured Jaipur Literature Festival, or Agra for Taj Mahotsav, a 10-day carnival of culture, cuisine and crafts featuring 400 artisans from all over India (and enough regional food to induce a curry coma). Alternatively, make for the hills and join Buddhist communities embracing Losar, the Tibetan New Year.
Other red-letter days on the calendar include the Hindu festival of Vasant Panchami in January or February, marking the arrival of spring. In February or March, you can attend Goa�s lively carnival; honor Lord Shiva at celebrations across the country for Maha Shivaratri; or join in the joyful mayhem as mountains of rainbow-colored powder are thrown around for the festival of Holi.
June to November is the best time to hit the Himalayas
India�s shoulder season means different things depending on where you go in the country. The plains are drenched by the monsoon rains from June to September, and Goa�s beach resorts become ghost towns, but backpackers and trekkers flood into the mountains, filling Ladakh�s lodges, tented camps, and yoga retreats.
This is the prime time for treks on India�s high-altitude trails, but roads and paths through the foothills turn into torrents, national park trails close, and views disappear behind swirling clouds. That might give an impression of a country besieged by rain, but it doesn�t rain all day every day; there�s still plenty to see and do, with bargain prices for accommodations and tours.
As the rains clear from September, tourism picks up in the plains and the foothills, but Ladakh closes down for the season, and public buses between Leh and Manali stop running. October and November are great times to visit almost everywhere else in India � prices remain below the peak, skies are clear and the trekking season gets underway in the foothills. This is also a great month to visit desert areas such as Rajasthan, which can be surprisingly green.

In June or July, Rath Yatra sees effigies of Lord Jagannath � Vishnu as Lord of the Universe � hauled through the streets on vast, colorful chariots, most famously in Puri in Odisha (Orissa). Buddhist festivals fill the gompas of Ladakh � Hemis Tsechu is a glorious spectacle, with costumed dances and the unfurling of a giant thangka (Buddhist painting) at Hemis Gompa.
August is jam-packed with festival action. Kerala�s exhilarating boat races take place on the second Sunday of August and there are patriotic flag-hoisting ceremonies and parades in Delhi on August 15 to celebrate India�s independence. Falling in August or September, Ganesh Chaturthi sees the ritual immersion of thousands of colorful idols of the elephant-headed god in Mumbai.
There�s more action in October and November, as Hindus honor Durga, the fearsome form of the mother goddess, most famously at Navratri and Durga Puja (celebrated enthusiastically in Kolkata and West Bengal). Many areas throw lavish celebrations for Dussehra, celebrating the victory of Hindu god Rama over demon-king Ravana and the triumph of good over evil (festivities are particularly colorful in Kullu and Mysuru). 
This is also the season for Diwali (Deepavali), which brings fireworks and twinkling lights to towns and villages across India, and the Camel Fair in Pushkar, which attracts 200,000 people and 50,000 camels, horses, and cattle. Sikhs celebrate Nanak Jayanti � the birthday of Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism � with prayers, kirtan (devotional singing), and processions, especially in Punjab and Haryana.

April to June is the best time to avoid crowds
India�s low season sees temperatures soaring to almost unbearable levels. By May, the lowlands feel like an oven, and locals wait eagerly for the cooling effect of the monsoon. Cities can be uncomfortably hot � sensible travelers head to the hill stations or stay close to the water on the coast. The Northeast is wet, but it�s peak season for visiting Sikkim and highland areas of West Bengal, including Darjeeling.
If you can handle the heat, tourists are thinner on the ground, making visits to popular sights such as Delhi�s Red Fort less hectic, and this is a great time for treks in the cooler foothills of the Himalayas. Accommodation prices are also low, though many beachside hotels in Goa close completely from May to September. If you happen to be in Maharashtra, you�re in for a treat as tasty Alphonso mangoes come into season.
Rain doesn�t halt the festival calendar. Mahavir Jayanti commemorates the birth of Jainism�s 24th and most important tirthankar (teacher and enlightened being), while Sikhs celebrate Vaisakhi (the solar new year) in the middle of April. Rama Navami is another big date as Hindus celebrate Rama's birth with processions and enactments of scenes from the Ramayana (one of Hinduism�s most sacred texts).
The Muslim holy month of Ramadan runs from approximately March 10 to April 9 in 2024. Some Muslim-owned businesses close during the day, and people fast from sunrise to sunset. The breaking of the fast at Eid al-Fitr is marked by feasting, and Muslim women adorn their arms with mehndi (henna designs). The birthday of Buddha (Buddha Jayanti) is celebrated with gusto in Bodhgaya and Tibetan Buddhist areas.
Understanding India�s festival calendar
While secular festivals in India follow the Gregorian calendar, most religious festivals follow lunar calendars, so the dates change every year. Muslim celebrations move forward by 11 days every year relative to the Gregorian calendar, and Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain festivals can fall in different months from year to year. Always check the dates of festivals before planning a trip � the Indian government has a calendar of the year's gazetted government holidays."

See this beautiful nation on your schedule on one of our top road trips.,The 9 most spectacular road trips in India,"In India, every journey is an experience, whether you rumble across the subcontinent on a classic Enfield motorcycle or rattle through the hills in a chartered 4WD.
The simple act of traveling from A to B�will immerse you in the sights, sounds and sensations of the world�s most colorful country. Plenty of people get around�by bus and train, but taking a road trip will give you extra control over your itinerary, letting you choose where to stop and which route to follow.
The good news is that you don�t need to drive yourself � it�s easy to hire a car or 4WD with a driver almost everywhere in India, meaning you can concentrate on the scenery while your driver deals with the sometimes challenging road conditions.�
If you prefer to take the driving seat, renting a motorcycle is a wonderful way to explore the subcontinent, particularly if you stick to the backroads. Self-drive car rental is harder to arrange, but some adventurous souls travel around India with their own vehicles � a few hardy travelers have even navigated India in a modified autorickshaw!
Grab your sense of adventure and get ready to hit the road with this guide to the best road trips in India.�
Experience the best of the Golden Triangle on a road trip � Christophe Boisvieux / Getty Images
1. India�s Golden Triangle�
Best road trip for Mughal monumentsDelhi�Delhi; 1120km (696 miles); allow five days
Short and sweet, the loop from�Delhi to�Agra and�Jaipur packs a lot of wonders into a few days of driving. Your adventure begins in Delhi, where the ruins of eight cities tell the story of India�s great Islamic empires. Hit�the city's highlights, including Red Fort, Humayun�s Tomb, the Jama Masjid and the bazaars of Chandni Chowk, which have changed only superficially since Mughal emperor Shah Jahan�s time.
With a chartered vehicle or rented motorcycle, it�s easy to swing by the sacred cities of Mathura and Vrindavan, where Krishna frolicked with milkmaids in the Hindu epics. After these peaceful stops, steel yourself for a mix of the stressful and sublime in Agra, where the glorious�Taj Mahal more than lives up to its reputation.
Find more Mughal magnificence at nearby�Fatehpur Sikri, the red sandstone city founded and later abandoned by emperor Akbar the Great. Once you follow the NH21 to Jaipur, you�ll share every fort, palace and mystical observatory with a crowd, so consider making the odd detour before you hit the Pink City�s palaces and bazaars.�
Detour: Before zooming west from Fatehpur Sikri to Jaipur, consider a detour south to�Gwalior, whose beautiful fort is less mobbed than other stops on this circuit. Before you complete the third side of the triangle, tack on one more detour to spot tigers stalking ruined battlements in�Ranthambhore National Park before diving back into urban life.
2. Manali to Ladakh across the Himalaya
Best road trip for silence and serenity Manali�Srinagar; 800km (497 miles); allow ten days
Many people follow the mountain circuit from�Manali to�Ladakh and on to�Kashmir in a chartered 4WD, but we strongly recommend traveling by rented Enfield Bullet motorcycle. This allows you the life-affirming thrill of pulling over by the roadside to find yourself alone in the silence of these high-altitude deserts in the rain shadow of the Himalayas.
From the hippie hill resort of�Manali, it�s a two-day slog over the 3978m (13,051ft)�Rohtang La to�Leh, through a landscape plucked straight from the heyday of the Silk Road. There�s little vegetation and even less shade, and the cold and altitude will hit you like a sledgehammer. Recuperate with trips to Buddhist monasteries and yoga classes in Leh, then hit the road again for a different take on the Himalayas in Kashmir.
The highway west to�Srinagar weaves between ancient villages, but as the hills turn from dust-yellow to lush green, the culture shifts from Buddhism to Islam before the minarets of Srinagar loom into view. The Kashmir valley is sometimes troubled, but when it�s calm, the experience of watching�Dal Lake appearing slowly through the morning mist from the deck of a houseboat is simply sublime.�
Planning tip: Whether you drive yourself or let someone else take the wheel, it's imperative to respect the mountain climate. Snow closes the high passes into Ladakh in winter, and road travel is usually only possible from June to late September or early October.

3. Rajasthan�s colored cities�
Best road trip for desert colorsJaipur�Jaipur; 1630km (1012 miles); allow ten days
Desert driving in�Rajasthan is an incredible experience. Mighty fortresses loom dramatically out of the landscape, and you�ll share the dusty highways with camel carts and old-timers, some with vividly colored turbans and handsome mustaches. Kick-off in�Jaipur � the pink city � touring pink-sandstone palaces, bustling bazaars and the awe-inspiring fortress at�Amber.
Follow NH48 to the Jain and Muslim pilgrimage center of�Ajmer, and duck west to reach the famous�Pushkar, with its temple-circled lake and�legendary camel fair in October or November. Return to NH48 for the rumbling ride to�Udaipur, the white city � draped like a silk scarf on the shores of tranquil Lake Pichola. Dose up on ice-white palaces, then deviate west to the temple-strewn hill station of�Mt Abu.�
Veering north to�Jodhpur, you�ll immediately spot the lapis-colored buildings that earned the Blue City its name. Get another blast of military might at�Mehrangarh Fort, then drive west through serious desert country to the sand-yellow city of�Jaisalmer, whose fortified walls look almost carved from the desert itself. Close off the loop via�Bikaner, where you�ll leave the tourist crowds behind before diving back into the thick of things in Jaipur.
Detour: Having your own transport opens up the opportunity to get off the tourist track in this heavily visited state. Consider tacking on a side-trip north from Jaipur to Shekhawati, famed for its mural-filled haveli mansions.�
4. Hampi and the Hoysalas
Best road trip for templesMysuru�Gokarna; 1060km (659 miles); allow ten days
For many travelers, visiting the time-tumbled ruins of the Vijayanagar kingdom at�Hampi is the�most memorable experience�during a trip to India. Start off in�Mysuru (formerly Mysore), with its mesmerizing markets, fiery vegetarian cuisine and famously extravagant�palace. Rumble north on the backroads to fascinating Sravanabelagola with its naked 17m (56ft) statue of�Gomateshvara, the first tirthankara�(spiritual teacher) of the Jain religion.
The temples just keep on coming in Karnataka. Slingshot through Hassan to Belur and Halebid, where the�temples of the Hoysala Empire represent perhaps the zenith of the Hindu temple-building art. A three-hour drive east will drop you in Karnataka�s capital,�Bengaluru, known for its cosmopolitan dining, shopping and nightlife. Enjoy its comforts; it�s a long drive to reach Hosapete, the leaping-off point for the ruins at Hampi.
Once you roll into Hampi�s centuries-old bazaar, allow at least two days to explore toppled temples and time travel across centuries in a landscape of stacked granite boulders. For more timeless temple architecture, duck onto the backroads to reach Badami, where blood-colored cliffs are pock-marked with�cave temples.
Detour: To mix things up, consider taking a side trip to Aihole, dotted with dusty ruins from the ancient Chalukya kingdom, then finish on the beach with some well-earned R&R in�Gokarna���part pilgrim-town, part beach retreat.�
5. Kolkata to Darjeeling
Best road trip for Himalayan views and side treksKolkata�Yuksom; 808km (502 miles); allow eight days
The east of India is often overlooked by the crowds who surge north from Delhi, but the journey through West Bengal to the foothills of 8586m (28,169ft) Mt Khangchendzonga has an epic sense of mission. Start in crowded but cultured�Kolkata, visiting ashrams, temples and striking civic buildings reclaimed from British rule. Fit in a tour of the tiger-stalked swamps of the�Sunderbans before you head for the hills.�
The journey north takes you past little-visited country towns to intriguing�Shantiniketan, a university town with a long history of dance, theater and poetry. From here, you�ll break north to reach the emerald-green tea plantations and delightfully dated grand hotels of�Darjeeling, where you�ll likely catch your first up-close views of the Himalayas.
To get intimate with the snow peaks, walk the Singalila Ridge trekking route or edge even closer to Mt Khangchendzonga by picking up a permit to enter lofty�Sikkim. A route through�Kalimpong,�Gangtok and Pelling will reveal views that would make mountaineers itch for their ice axes. To cap it all off, you can get within touching distance of the snow on the trek to the Goecha La from Yuksom.
Planning tip: You�ll need a Restricted Areas Permit to enter Sikkim, but this is easily obtained in Kolkata, Siliguri or Darjeeling, or when crossing into Sikkim at Melli or Rangpo.

6. Mumbai to Goa�
Best road trip for beachesMumbai�Palolem; 650km (404 miles); allow one week
Short journeys don�t mean scrimping on excitement in India. From brash and brilliant�Mumbai, pick up NH66 and head south, detouring down to the coast to explore fascinating forts such as�Murud-Janjira, a legacy of centuries of coastal conquest. Pull into the low-key seaside resorts at Ganpatipule and Malvan before you hit the busy beaches of�Goa.�
As you roll into northern Goa, swing by the famous market in�Anjuna and the fun-filled beach hubs at�Baga and Calangute. Head onward to�Panaji, Goa�s charming Portuguese-colonial capital, and the timeworn basilicas of�Old Goa.
The mood changes as you roll south to laid-back�Agonda, the center of Goa�s nascent surfing scene. It changes again as you head inland through green hills dotted with spice farms for a peek at thundering�Dudhsagar Falls, India�s second-highest cascade. Finish up on the sand-sprinkled shore at lovely�Palolem (making time for a bird-spotting�hike at the nearby�Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary).��
7. A drive through the northeast
Best road trip for tribal encountersGuwahati�Guwahati; 1700km (1056 miles); allow two weeks
With a hired 4WD and a driver who can speak local languages, a fascinating journey through the varied cultures of the northeast states awaits. Start in�Guwahati, the under-explored capital of Assam, and follow the mighty Brahmaputra River northeast to�Kaziranga National Park for close encounters with one-horned Indian rhinos.
Next, aim your sights north towards�Arunachal Pradesh and the awesome�Buddhist monasteries of the Tawang Valley (local travel agencies can arrange a permit).
Add on a wander through the tribal communities of Ziro and Daporijo, and loop back through Upper Assam, continuing east to the fascinating Konyak Naga villages around Mon in northern�Nagaland. Slip back to the plains via Kohima (ideally in December to catch the�Hornbill Festival), then climb up onto the high plateau of�Meghalaya, where trees are woven into living bridges and markets sell bows and arrows as day-to-day essentials, before barrelling downhill from�Shillong to Guwahati.
Planning tip: A Protected Area Permit is required to enter Arunachal Pradesh, and you may need to be in a group of two or more to visit some areas; contact travel agencies in Guwahati in advance to get the paperwork in place.

8. Around the tip of India
Best road trip in the southKochi�Kochi; 807km (501 miles); allow 7 days
The bottom end of India feels like a different country. Start the journey through India�s steamy south in historic�Kochi, whose ancient streets tell a timeless tale of seafaring, trade and Keralan spices. As you roam south to�Alappuzha, park up for a day or two to explore the fascinating, waterlogged backwaters by boat.
As you pass through�Amrithapuri, you can pause for a hug from a living guru before soaking up some rays on�Kerala�s loveliest beaches at�Varkala. Next, whoosh through�Thiruvananthapuram (pause just long enough for some incendiary Keralan curries) to the southern tip of India. From here, you�ll head inland, through drier, rockier Tamil Nadu, to reach�Madurai, whose temple towers are encrusted with brightly colored deities and demons.
The trip back to Kochi will take you through the Palani Hills, a side spur of the Western Ghats, where the landscape surges upwards to�Kodaikanal, perhaps the most charming of India�s southern hill stations. Grab a cuppa amidst swirling tea plantations in�Munnar, South India�s top tea-growing center, before you return to the coast.�
Planning tip: The monsoon obscures the views from the Western Ghats from June to September, but waterfalls run at full force, so this is still a rewarding time to come.
9. Chennai to Puducherry (Pondicherry)
Best road trip for cultural varietyChennai�Puducherry; 232km (144 miles); allow 3 to 4 days
For a short, sweet and spicy trip along India�s southeast coast, consider the three-day trip from�Chennai south to�Puducherry (Pondicherry). Start in Chennai, with its vast beach, famous-name ashrams and�delicious vegetarian cuisine, then track south along the coast, wedged between the sea and the salt lake.
Stop one is the surprising surf resort at Kovalam (Covelong), a worthy stop en route to�Mamallapuram, where you can view a riot of carvings and temples created by the Pallava dynasty. Duck inland to see the ancient Pallava capital at�Kanchipuram, then return to the coast to close out the trip at charming Puducherry, formerly Pondicherry.
A Gallic air pervades this seaside town � best experienced in heritage hotels in the old French Quarter. Just be warned: some spiritually-minded travelers pull into the famous ashram at�Auroville just north of ""Pondy"" and never leave!�

Top tips for hiring a car and driver in India
You�ll find drivers-for-hire offering their services at taxi and 4WD stands all over India, or you can make arrangements through hotels and travel agencies. Check that the driver speaks enough English to understand where you want to go and where you want to stop, and confirm that the driver is able to cross state lines � some vehicles are only licensed to operate in certain areas.�
You�ll need to agree on a price for the trip before you start, and the cost should include fuel, accommodation and food for the driver for multi-day trips. Prices start at around US$40 per day, rising for 4WD vehicles. Be clear with your driver about what you want from your journey; if you want to avoid stops at tourist shops and commission-paying venues, make this clear from the outset.
Exploring India by motorcycle or bike is for experienced riders
India�s roads are not for fair-weather motorcyclists, but if you have a few miles under your belt and fancy a challenge, it�s a fabulous way to explore this enormous country. Veteran hire companies such as�Lalli Singh Tours in�Delhi have sent hundreds of travelers off on journeys across India, from the steamy southern jungles to the high passes of the Himalayas.��
The best advice we can give is to ride slowly and defensively, always give way to larger vehicles, and carry a full repair kit and spares � and know how to use them! The nostalgic British-designed Enfield Bullet is the vehicle of choice for many travelers, but it�s a heavy brute; newer machines from the likes of Bajaj are lighter and easier to handle.
If you plan to pedal your way around India by bicycle, carry plenty of puncture repair kits and bring lights and high visibility gear. If you don�t want to transport your own bike into the country, consider flying into Delhi and buying a bike at the Jhandewalan Cycle Market."
Travel,147,Everything you need to know about visiting India with kids,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/india-with-kids,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2023-11/GettyImages-1409035632.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,12-12-23,"The incredible sights, sounds and smells in India mean your little ones will never be bored for long. Here's how best to visit India with tots in tow.",Everything you need to know about visiting India with kids,"India loves kids of all ages. Its lively tumult, which can be overwhelming for adults, is manna to children. The sights, sounds and smells mean they�re never bored. And their actions, exclamations and even tantrums, which may raise eyebrows elsewhere, are easily absorbed by India�s accommodating culture.
While the country may throw up challenges for traveling families � the need for vaccinations, heavy traffic and not being able to drink tap water � parents will never struggle to find a restaurant or hotel that welcomes children. And you�ll always find something great to do with kids in every part of India.
Is India good for kids?
Undoubtedly. From friendliness and affordability to experiences and activities, India is an amazing destination for families. Usually, children under five years stay and eat free in hotels, and kids under 12 can sleep on an extra bed in your room at a minimal charge. Many restaurants have kiddie menus, and others are happy to customize meals to cater to tiny palates.
When it comes to getting around, the cost of flight tickets can add up for large families, so give the trains a shot. Booking four adjacent berths in air-conditioned first-class or two-tier A/C class gets you your own private compartment and a comfortable family experience.
Renting a taxi for a day of sightseeing is also a practical option � providing the flexibility to stop when cranky children need to stretch their legs or when you spot a clean washroom or an intriguing sight. Within India�s biggest cities, you can take the metro or hop into a three-wheeled autorickshaw for a fun family adventure.
Prepare your kids for two of the things that India will throw at them. The country has many more people than they�re probably used to and it�s easy for small travelers to get confused or lost in a crowd, so make sure the kids always have your hotel�s card with the address and phone number in their pockets. Secondly, pedestrians do not have right of way on India�s roads. Cars will not stop for pedestrians, so always cross at pedestrian crossings (ideally with crossing guards) or look out for pedestrian bridges.

Where is best in India with kids?
India�s dramatic wildlife encounters are sure to wow children. Snorkel with turtles in the tropical Andaman and Nicobar Islands or cruise down the Chambal River in Rajasthan to spot prehistoric-looking gharial crocodiles with pot-like bumps on their snouts. Camp with fireflies in Maharashtra�s Purushwadi, spot endemic fauna in the dense rainforests of the Western Ghats, volunteer at an elephant rescue center in Mathura in Uttar Pradesh�or go on safari in one of 53 tiger reserves across the country to see Bengal tigers in the wild.
India is the perfect place to collect memorable experiences that little ones will cherish years later. Get lost together in the labyrinthine Bhool Bhulaiya maze in Lucknow, take a hot air balloon ride over Rajasthan�s forts, walk over living-root bridges in Meghalaya, or ride into the Himalayas on the toy train to Shimla that passes through more than 100 tunnels and over 800 bridges. For maximum magic, skip the hotels and spend a night in a houseboat in Kerala�s backwaters, camp under the stars in the Thar Desert or travel on the luxurious Deccan Odyssey train.
Choosing what to see and where to go can be hard, so let the weather play a part in your travel plans. The dry months from September to March are pleasant in most of India; Goa�s beaches are fabulous at this time but avoid the Himalayas unless you�re prepared for the cold. Save exploring those mighty mountains and their stunning landscapes and welcoming communities for the pre-monsoon season from April to June, when it�s burning hot in the lowlands. The monsoon season, from July to August, is a challenging travel period and best avoided with children.
Best things to do in India with babies and toddlers
Plan a trip based on your interests before kids start asserting their own ideas! Ask for an electric kettle at your accommodation for mixing baby formula and sterilizing bottles.
Discover jungles and palaces in Rajasthan
Rajasthan is known for its forts and former royal families, but the state has amazing wildlife, too. Stay at a comfortable jungle camp in Jawai, Rajasthan, and go on safari rides to see leopards in this stony, scrub landscape. It�s a remarkable and accessible place to explore, where leopards thrive close to people and villages.
Continue to Kumbhalgarh to walk the ramparts of its impressive fort, a Unesco World Heritage Site, then round the trip off with a visit to Udaipur, the romantic city of lakes and palaces.
Mix heritage and cooler climes in Kerala
Relaxed Kochi is a place to explore at an easy pace. There are arty cafes, cool studios selling clothing and mementos, museums and art galleries, synagogues and churches and a rich cuisine that reflects the city�s many cultural influences. Tots will enjoy a boat ride on the scenic Kochi backwaters, and the Kochi Biennale, India�s largest art fair, runs for four months every alternate year, providing a visual treat.
Continue inland to Munnar for an indulgent stay among the tea estates that carpet the gentle hillsides. For a fun family retreat, stay in one of the heritage bungalows at this British-colonial-era hill station. Bring long sleeves and trousers for walks in the tea estates; if it is wet, carry a sachet of salt to deter the leeches that lurk in the undergrowth.

Best things to do in India with kids
Destinations that offer a lot to do in one place work best for young kids since they tend to get fidgety with too much travel. Mix up the itinerary, alternating high-energy experiences with moments of calm at strategically chosen restaurants or snack breaks in the outdoors.
Discover a different India in Ahmedabad
For a family immersion into old India, spend a couple of nights in Ahmedabad, the country�s first Unesco Urban World Heritage Site. The city�s Old Quarter has fascinating 200-year-old mansions you can stay in, the street food is delicious (eat where the locals take their children) and the Sabarmati riverfront is a lovely area to explore with kids. A massive kite festival is organized in January each year � a visual delight for young travelers.
For more kid-friendly encounters, drive two hours to Balasinor to stay in a heritage homestay at the Garden Palace, still occupied by the town�s former royal family. It�s a handy base for exploring the nearby fossil park � the second largest in the world � where the Rajasaurus, dubbed India�s T-Rex, was discovered. Numerous dinosaur hatcheries and fossils of 13 dinosaur species were found at this site and there�s a small museum.
Returning to Ahmedabad, make a longish day visit to Rani-ki-Vav (Queen�s Stepwell) in Patan, a 2�-hour drive each way. This 11th-century Unesco World Heritage Site is a bit like an upside-down temple, with seven flights of stairs lined with intricate sculptures leading to the well at the bottom. Don�t skip the Patan-Patola Heritage Museum just down the road.
Make the most of the water in Goa
For a relaxing beach holiday, head to a south Goa village such as Benaulim or Palolem. The more serene half of the state, South Goa has gentler beaches, kid-friendly beach shacks for meals, and lifeguards on duty. There are plenty of guesthouses, hotels, and cottages to rent for long stays, and there�s plenty to do away from the beach as well.
Get a gentle taste of the Himalayas
To experience the Himalayas in comfort, go to Gushaini village in Himachal Pradesh�s Tirthan Valley. The gateway to the Greater Himalayan National Park, this cozy village has numerous places to stay set beside the Tirthan River. Pick a homestay amid apple orchards and immerse yourself in Himachali cuisine and hospitality.
Spend days by the river painting pebbles, building small dams along the riverbanks and spotting tiny fish in the eddies. Older kids can try fly fishing and hikes in the national park.
Step into history at Hampi
Hampi was once the capital of an ancient empire, and its former glory is evident in the ancient structures that dot its boulder-strewn landscapes. Culture-loving kids will be fascinated by the forts, temples�and ruins spilling out between the outcrops. If your kids are more adventurous, take a ferry across the Tungabhadra River to visit the Anegundi fort and climb 570 steps to the temple of Hanuman, the beloved monkey god who is an endless source of fascination for children.
To experience more of this ethereal landscape, go bouldering on the outcrops with a local climbing operator, schedule a walk with a naturalist at Hampi�s Boulders Resort�or spot birds and look for signs of sloth bears, mostly seen in the evenings or at Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary.

Best things to do in India with tweens and teens
Tweens and teens have very definite likes. Depending on what they are into, choose a destination that offers culture, adventure, wildlife or a mix of all three!
Water adventures in India�s far south
Visit Palk Bay, near the southern tip of India, for some of the country's calmest beaches and clearest waters. Stay at a beach resort and book into a water sports academy for activities that suit your desired level of exertion. There are sailing trips for the family, guided kayak tours for teens and windsurfing or diving lessons for sporty folk.
To wrap the holiday up with a dose of culture, drive 2� hours north to the town of Karaikudi to stay in a 100-year-old Chettinad mansion, visit atmospheric antique stores piled with old treasures and enjoy delicious local food.
Meet rhinos in Assam
For one of India�s most magical wildlife encounters, meet the one-horned Indian rhinoceros in the grasslands of Kaziranga National Park in Assam, then round the trip off with a stay in one of the area�s British-colonial-era tea estates. This will take you off the main tourist map in India into a world of memorable experiences.
Discover risque sculptures and tigers in Madhya Pradesh
To see the royal Bengal tiger in the wild, pick Panna Tiger Reserve over Madhya Pradesh�s more popular Kanha or Pench national parks, which tend to get crowded. As well as tigers, you may spot a leopard or sloth bear, Ken River crocodiles and a dazzling diversity of bird life.
The famous temples of Khajuraho are just an hour away, but don�t let the temples� reputation for erotic art deter you. The sexual scenes are depicted as a normal aspect of life just like agriculture, art, culture, sports, war, etc., on the temples� beautiful facades.
Go hiking on the Singalila ridge
From the hill station of Darjeeling, plan a trek with older kids along the stunning Singalila Ridge on the border between India and Nepal. This moderately challenging hike has great views of the eastern Himalayas, including four of the world�s five highest peaks. In April and May, the blooming rhododendron forests and bountiful bird life make this trail extra special. There�s a chance of spotting the adorable but shy red panda, and there are trekkers� lodges and huts for overnight stays.

Planning Tips

Before you come to India, visit your doctor and ensure the children have the necessary shots. Carry basic meds for fever, flu, nausea, diarrhea�and allergies. Make sure you have mosquito repellent and plenty of sunscreen. Pack light cotton clothing that can cover the arms and legs; it�s more culturally acceptable and will protect from the sun and mosquitoes.
When it comes to accommodation, most hotels have family rooms with extra beds that are more affordable than booking separate rooms, or it�s easy to arrange an extra bed. Finding clean toilets can be a challenge, so brief children about safe ways to use public toilets. Touch as few surfaces as you can, squat rather than sit�and carry your own toilet paper, hand sanitizer�and a toilet seat disinfectant spray in your day bag.
Prepare children for their first glimpse of India. The sights, smells, sounds, crowds and poverty can be a little overwhelming when they first land in a big city like�Delhi, Mumbai or Bengaluru, and the culture shock can color their visit without some warning.
India�s love for children also means there are few boundaries. Everyone wants to talk to visiting children, touch them�and photograph them. If you�re not comfortable with photos, politely say no. Guide kids to respond with a wave, a thumbs up�or a �namaste� (�hello�) when they need to.
If you have a fussy eater, carry some ready-to-cook packet foods with you. Most hotels and all homestays will indulge you and follow the packet instructions to make children a familiar meal when they need a taste of home. The popularity of European and American cuisine in India also means you can always find some version of grilled chicken, sauteed vegetables, pizzas, pastas�or burgers wherever you go.
Indian cuisine has plenty of kid-friendly options�like dosas (rice and lentil crepes) and idlis (steamed rice and lentil cakes) in the south and stuffed parathas (flatbreads) and rice and lentils in the north. Any decent restaurant will serve purified water, so bring your own water bottles and refill them to limit single-plastic use.
India�s roads are not very stroller friendly � use a baby carrier for younger children. Plan your travel so that pre-schoolers and upwards can get regular rests and only walk when they need to (autorickshaws and pedal rickshaws are handy for energy-saving short hops)."

With our round-up of the most wonderful places to visit, of course!",The 15 most spectacular places to visit in India,"India�s astonishing variety of sights has to be seen to be believed. Travelers have devoted lifetimes to exploring the famous places and forgotten corners of this incredible country, driven onwards by the certainty that there�s always more to see.
Mughal palaces, towering Hindu temples, mountain monasteries, lost kingdoms, cultured cities, and genteel hill stations in the foothills of the Himalayas all jostle for attention in a country that is proudly shaking off the legacy of colonialism and repositioning itself as a global superpower. With such incredible diversity on offer, there�s just one question � where do you start?
Well, our advice is to not take on too much during a single visit. Pick an area � the tropical south perhaps, or the northern plains, or the mountain valleys of the Himalayas � and give yourself time to pause and soak up the atmosphere as you work through your must-see list.
Wherever you go, you�re guaranteed a mind-expanding and exhilarating blast of color, soul-soaring splendor, earth-shaking history and moments of pure serenity. Equal parts magic and mayhem, this mix is what makes traveling to India such an intense and addictive experience.
While this was no easy list to compile, we�re proud to present our pick of the ten best places to visit in India.
1. Agra, Uttar Pradesh
Best�for romantics and fans of Mughal history
At the top of everyone�s bucket list, the Taj Mahal is as glorious as people imagine it would be � a magnificent monument to lost love, executed in pearl-white marble. Views of the world�s most beautiful building framed by a Mughal archway or floating above the misty Yamuna River will be one of the defining moments of any trip to India.
But there�s more to the former Mughal capital than the Taj. Add on a couple of days so you can visit the architecturally stunning tomb of�Emperor Akbar, his rose-red sandstone former capital at Fatehpur Sikri and sprawling Agra Fort, one of India�s most epic fortifications. Thronged by millions of visitors, Agra is not always relaxing, but it�s eternally fascinating.
An evening excursion on the sacred Ganges in Varanasi will broaden your horizons � De Visu / Shutterstock
2. Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh
Best for intense spirituality
There are few places as beguiling and bewitching as the sacred Hindu city of Varanasi. Millennia-old death rituals play out daily at the cremation ghats that line the bank of the sacred River Ganges, while the maze-like alleyways of the nearby old town reveal dizzying surprises at every turn. We defy anyone to visit without experiencing some internal soul-searching about their place in the universe.
Be ready for some challenges. The hard-edged realities of life and death and the inequalities that continue to cause hardship for many in India are obvious on the streets of the world�s oldest living city. But there are also moments of gentleness � rise at dawn and wander the ghats (riverside steps) and you�ll see Varanasi at its most spiritual, with its attention focused on the sacred river, before the tourist bustle changes the mood.
Planning tip: The best way to appreciate Varanasi�s famous ghats is from a rowboat. Boatmen offer their services from first light at boat stations along the west bank of the Ganges, providing views of a riverfront that has changed only superficially in seven centuries.
3. Mumbai, Maharashtra
Best for urban explorers and Bollywood hopefuls
Mumbai is the perfect place to take the pulse of modern India. The most densely populated city in the subcontinent is home to Bollywood film stars, enterprising market vendors, bankers and executives rushing to work in offices, and fishing families who can trace their origins back to the days when this mighty metropolis was just a humble village.
To understand more about the disparities of life in contemporary Mumbai, take a socially responsible tour through the city�s huge and disadvantaged Dharavi district with Reality Tours & Travel; 80% of the profits go back to social projects providing opportunities for those left behind by Mumbai�s push for success.
The city�s can�t-miss excursion is the boat trip to the 1500-year-old, UNESCO World Heritage-listed rock-cut temples of Elephanta Island, but fantastic street food is the city�s great leveler. Don�t leave without sampling Mumbai's signature snack, bhel poori � puffed rice and fried dough with lentils, onions, herbs and savory chutneys, best sampled on the beach at Chowpatty or Juhu.
Detour: With time to spare in Mumbai, head to the northern suburbs, where Sanjay Gandhi National Park protects a sprawl of dry forest, home to leopards, deer, monkeys and serene Buddhist cave temples.
At Thiksey Monastery in Ladakh, visitors can dive into traditional Tibetan Buddhist culture � Twenty47studio / Getty Images
4. Ladakh
Best for an extraordinary taste of Tibet
In the far northwest of India, sheltered from the monsoon by the rain shadow of the Himalayas, the former Buddhist kingdom of Ladakh is culturally and geographically closer to western Tibet than anywhere in India. In this high-altitude moonscape, towering Tibetan monasteries melt into a landscape of barren rock and wind-sculpted hoodoos (don�t miss fabulous Hemis and Thiksey on the road linking Ladakh to Himachal Pradesh).�
Most visitors start in the atmospheric capital, Leh, before roaming to neighboring valleys for homestay treks and trips to view turquoise salt lakes and colorful masked dances at ancient monasteries. Ladakh wasn't touched by China�s Cultural Revolution, so this is perhaps the closest independent travelers can come to experiencing the original culture of Tibet.
Planning tip: Getting to Ladakh is half the fun. Flights run to Leh even in the depths of winter, but the most enjoyable way in is overland, by road from either Srinagar in Kashmir or Manali in Himachal Pradesh. Buses and shared 4WDs run as long as the passes are open from June to the end of September, or you can tackle the route on a rented Enfield motorcycle.
5. Kolkata, West Bengal�
Best for culture vultures
The capital of colonial British India until 1911, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) is India�s third-biggest metropolis and the country's intellectual and artistic capital. Spend a few days exploring the energetic bazaars, cultured museums and British-era landmarks, and you�ll soon fall in love with Kolkata�s irrepressible energy.
To really get to know Kolkata, sign up for a Bengali cooking course�and visit the revered temple at Kalighat, where the goddess Kali is appeased with sacrifices. With more time to spare, book an overnight wildlife-watching tour to the nearby Sundarbans Tiger Reserve, a legendary stalking ground for royal Bengal tigers.
Planning tip: Try to time your visit to coincide with the festival of Durga Puja in September or October, when vividly colorful effigies of the goddess are displayed in pandals (ceremonial tents) all over the city.���
6. Jaisalmer, Rajasthan
Best for desert drama
The desert state of Rajasthan shows India at its most romantic and soft-filtered. Expect a mirage of camel caravans, ornate palaces, mighty forts, turbaned traders and intense colors, set against a backdrop of shifting desert sands. It�s unbelievably photogenic, but also firmly on the tourist map, so expect to share the experience with a crowd.
The pink-sandstone monuments of Jaipur, the ice-white lakeside palaces of Udaipur, and views of blue-hued Jodhpur from its lofty fort are all stunning experiences, but the city that delivers the biggest jolt to the senses is Jaisalmer, seeming sculpted from the living rock of the desert.
Its tangled lanes, towering fortress and beautifully ornate haveli (traditional houses) could have been plucked from the pages of One Thousand and One Nights, and the surrounding desert is the evocative setting for overnight camel safaris.
Planning tip: While it is possible to stay inside the fortified city, visitor numbers are having an impact on Jaisalmer�s historic heart. We recommend staying outside the walls instead � there are plenty of hotels and guesthouses within strolling distance of the fort.
A slow-paced cruise through the languid backwaters of Kerala provides an escape from India�s glorious chaos � Eddie Gerald / Lonely Planet
7. The Kerala Backwaters
Best for lovers of slow travel
After the dusty, densely populated northern plains, tropical South India offers a lusher, more laid-back travel experience. The quintessential trip here is a slow-paced canal cruise through the emerald-green backwaters of Kerala, a 900-mile network of languid, coconut-fringed waterways, offering views of an ever-changing tableaux of South Indian life.
Hire a traditional houseboat in Alappuzha for a multiday trip, then settle in for a succulent Keralan seafood curry prepared by your personal chef as the sunset blushes over shimmering waters and silhouetted palm fronds. Post-cruise, it�s just a short hop up the coast to historic Kochi (Cochin), with its cantilevered fishing nets and Kathakali dance theaters.
8. Bodhgaya, Bihar
Best for budding Buddhists
As the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism (plus countless smaller faiths), India is defined by sacred geography. Even here, however, few places resonate more powerfully than the Bodhi tree where Prince Siddhartha Gautama achieved enlightenment to become the Buddha (Awakened One).
The town that has grown up around this sacred spot is home to dozens of Tibetan and Southeast Asian�style temples and monasteries, with a busy program of Buddhist teachings and courses. It�s the ideal destination for any spiritual explorer.
To get a feel for Bodhgaya�s rhythms, come early to the Mahabodhi complex and settle in beside chanting Tibetan pilgrims to meditate on the nature of impermanence. Travel experiences don�t get much more profound than this.
Planning tip: Bodhgaya is just one stop on the so-called ""Buddhist circuit,"" taking in key locations from the life of the historical Buddha. Local buses run to nearby Rajgir, the site of one of the first Buddhist monasteries, and Nalanda's ancient Buddhist university complex.��
9. Darjeeling, West Bengal
Best for a premium cup of tea with a view
Fanned by the cool breezes of the eastern Himalayas, surrounded by manicured tea estates and basking in front of epic Himalayan views, Darjeeling is easy to fall for.
For a perfect day, watch the dawn break over 8586m (20,169ft) Kangchenjunga, learn the difference between first-flush and white teas on a plantation tour, linger over an afternoon cuppa at the�Windamere Hotel, then learn about the Tibetan experience at the Tibetan Refugee Self-Help Centre.
The classiest way to arrive is via the nostalgic, narrow-gauge toy train; book tickets in advance and check to see if the steam service is running (the diesel train follows the same route, but has less charm). Don�t miss the Buddhist gompas (monasteries) dotted around the city. Below Darjeeling on the fringes of Ghum, historic Yiga Choeling Gompa has a special magic.
Planning tip: Darjeeling isn�t the only interesting stop in the area. Shared 4WDs buzz from Darjeeling to Kalimpong, another historic township with colorful Buddhist monasteries, Himalayan views and pretty flower nurseries.�
History spills from the landscape on all sides in Hampi � Pikoso.kz / Shutterstock
10. Hampi, Karnataka
Best for a full immersion in history
Between the 14th and 16th centuries CE, the capital of the Vijayanagar empire at Hampi was home to half a million people, but this ancient metropolis was almost completely abandoned, leaving 3700 stone monuments scattered across a surreal plain of boulders.
This is a place to linger, strolling between the boulders to find carved masonry, forgotten shrines and the handsome remains of some of South India�s most dramatic stone temples.
Glance up as you wander and you�ll see rock climbers tackling bouldering routes using chisel marks made by ancient masons. Rent a motorcycle or scooter and you can roam further afield, taking in the hilltop temple marking the spot where the monkey god Hanuman first met Lord Rama.
Planning tip: Hampi is a short bus ride from the town of Hosapete � get here by overnight train from Goa�s beaches, historic Hyderabad or the cosmopolitan southern city of Bengaluru.
11. Arunachal Pradesh
Best for stepping off the map
Tucked away near Bangladesh, the eight Northeast States � Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim � are India�s wild frontier. Until the 1990s, this region of rugged mountain valleys was mostly off-limits to foreigners, and visitor numbers are still small � people who travel here earn the right to call themselves proper explorers.�
Sikkim is the most famous destination in the Northeast States, but we�d encourage you east towards the forested foothills and jagged mountains of Arunachal Pradesh, where tribal communities follow a diverse range of traditional belief systems, from the Buddhist Monpa people of Tawang to the animist Apatani people of the Ziro valley.�
Planning tip: Travel takes a bit of effort in Arunachal Pradesh; you�ll need to apply for a permit to enter the state, and local transport is patchy. By far the easiest way to explore is with a chartered 4WD and driver (easily arranged in Guwahati in Assam).��
Few places have such a powerful sense of devotion as Amritsar's Golden Temple � Tarzan9280 / Getty Images
12. Amritsar, Punjab
Best for experiencing the power of devotion
India has pilgrimage destinations to spare, but few come close to the vibrant energy of the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The most sacred site for the Sikh religion is a gleaming jewel box, floating in a mirror-like sacred pool, thronged day and night by an unbelievable mass of pilgrims. You don�t have to be spiritually inclined to feel its powerful rhythms.�
Joining devotees at the Sri Harmandir Sahib � the gold-paneled shrine at the heart of the complex � is incredibly moving. Staying overnight in the pilgrims' hostels that flank the temple compound only adds to the intensity. A donation is much appreciated for accommodation if possible, though pilgrims of all means will be accommodated if space is available. You can also sit down for meals at the temple langar (kitchen), which provides cost-free nourishment to a staggering 100,000 people per day (again, a donation is appreciated if you have the means). 
Planning tip: Don�t limit your explorations to the Golden Temple � the surrounding bazaars buzz with energy and atmosphere, with vendors selling everything from embroidered chappals (sliders) to brass and polished steel pots and pans.���
13. Mysuru (Mysore), Karnataka
Best for feeling like a Maharaja
The atmospheric South Indian city of Mysuru has multiple charms: towering temples, one of India�s most evocative marketplaces, and the almost impossibly extravagant crib that is Mysuru Palace, the ancestral home of the Wadiyar maharajas. No building conjures up the extravagant lives of India�s royal rulers quite so vividly � every room is a fantasy, every ornament an heirloom.�
Around the palace are busy bazaars, rewarding museums and a string of Hindu temples in the classic Dravidian (Southern Indian) architectural style. Devote several days to wandering the streets, hiking up to the Sri Chamundeshwari Temple on Chamundi Hill and feasting on fiery vegetarian�thalis (plate meals) in Mysuru�s�restaurants.��
Bandhavgarh National Park is one of the best places to spot a Bengal tiger � Art Wolfe / Getty Images
14. Bandhavgarh National Park, Madhya Pradesh
Best for tiger encounters
The national parks of Madhya Pradesh are some of the best places on the planet to get close to royal Bengal tigers. Seeing one of these striped superstars loping out of the jungle will stay with you for a lifetime � as well as leaving you heartbroken at the thought of how few tigers still survive in the wild.
Everyone has their favorite tiger reserve, but we rate Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve near Jabalpur for the density of wildlife in its central Tala range. Around 70 tigers roam these dry forests, alongside leopards, monkeys, deer and gaur � India�s gigantic wild buffalo. There�s a high likelihood of sightings if you devote several days to 4WD safaris (elephant safaris should be avoided as riding can be harmful to these vulnerable animals).�
Planning tip: The best time to see tigers is first thing in the morning � safaris start at 5:30am to catch tigers before they stake out a shady spot in the undergrowth to sleep through the heat of the day.�
15. Madurai, Tamil Nadu
Best for religious splendor
South India's Hindu temples are a joyous celebration of the divine, decorated inside and out with vividly colorful depictions of deities and supernatural beings, both fearsome and sublime. In the southern city of Madurai, the towering gopurams (gateway towers) of the Meenakshi Amman Temple provide a three-dimensional guide to the main deities of the Hindu pantheon.
The current temple was constructed in the 17th century, but the site has been sacred to Meenakshi, the queen of the Pandya kingdom and an incarnation of the goddess Parvati, for at least 2000 years. Come early in the morning to watch sunrise bring the temple to life, then pop to the nearest branch of Murugan Idli Shop for some of the south�s best idli (steamed rice and lentil cakes).��
Detour: A short bus or train ride from Madurai, Tiruchirappalli � aka Trichy � is another top spot for temple enthusiasts. The looming Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple is one of the world�s largest Hindu shrines, covering 155 acres (63 hectares) and topped by 21 deity-encrusted towers. More temples crown the rocky outcrop at the heart of the city, offering epic views over the rooftops."
Travel,149,"I�m traveling to India, is cash or credit card better to use there?",https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/cash-or-card-in-india-advice,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2023-12/help-me-lp-money.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,01-12-23,"Visitors to India can expect to use a combination of cash, credit cards and digital payments. Here�s what you need to know.","I�m traveling to India, is cash or credit card better to use there?","In this series, Lonely Planet�s team of writers and editors answers your travel problems and provides tips and hacks to help you plan a hassle-free trip. When it came to a question about India, we knew Mumbai-based LP editor Akanksha Singh would have the answer.
Question: I am traveling to India next month and have heard conflicting advice on carrying cash versus a card. Do most places accept (foreign) credit cards or do I need to have cash on me? Also, is it best to bring dollars or euros with me, or to withdraw cash from ATMs?�
Akanksha Singh: Money is a funny business in India. It wasn�t until a few years ago that the country moved away from a culture of corner shops tossing in a few sweets or chewing gum with your groceries if they were short on change. (A digital payments service called Paytm even launched an ad centered around this �sweet change.�)
Today, you�ll frequently see QR codes for cashless payments through services like Paytm or Google Pay on street side stalls, at temples and in auto rickshaws. In Bengaluru, India�s tech hub, you�ll even see roadside chai vendors who accept crypto.
All this is to say: it depends on where in India you�re traveling, and what you�re expecting from your trip. Here are a few points to consider as you plan.
In India, you�ll be able to pay with cash just about anywhere you go ��Subhendu Sarkar / LightRocket via Getty Images
Cash is king across the country
For the most part, you can�t go wrong with cash in India. Despite continued efforts to go �cashless� (especially during the pandemic), it�s rare for places not to accept cash.
If you�re planning on buying cash at a foreign-currency exchange before you leave for India, note that most foreign travelers are only allowed to import ?25,000 ($300) in cash.��
On the other hand, if you�re planning on converting currency after you arrive in India, be sure to avoid unauthorized outfits once you�re outside the airport (as always, exchange rates within the airport are weak, with higher fees). Sidestep this by heading to an established local bank; India�s reserve bank allows such institutions to buy or sell foreign currencies legally. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI and the State Bank of India all deal with a range of currencies and offer competitive rates.�
You can also withdraw cash from ATMs using a foreign card. Most ATMs will accept Visa and Mastercard, and a few will accept American Express and Diners Club, too. Just be warned that ATM cash withdrawals often come with high fees, and are subject to a variable withdrawal limit set by the local bank. For most banks, this limit is usually ?10,000 ($120) per day.��
In Indian cities, many vendors accept cashless payments � PradeepGaurs / Shutterstock
Big cities offer more cashless options
Cashless payment options do exist, but they�re almost always limited to bigger cities. Moreover, these options are hit or miss owing to ever-changing government policies that often leave travelers frustrated.
Most restaurants and bars will accept Visa and Mastercard over Amex and Diners Club. Virtual-card acceptance is low, so you�ll need a physical card ��and thanks to an ongoing stalemate between Apple and the Indian government, Apple Pay is a no-go.�
Your home-country Uber account should work seamlessly in India � but once in the country, it�s impossible to set up a new Uber account (or one with its Indian competitor Ola) using an international card. Similarly, online transactions using an international card are a gamble in India. This includes transactions on websites such as food-delivery platforms Swiggy, Zomato and Amazon.�
Opt for a combination of travel cards, cash and UPI for seamless travel
The good news is travelers are now allowed to make payments using UPI (India�s United Payments Interface), and several companies � including Wise and Revolut � offer travel cards that will work in India with lower transaction and withdrawal fees. (Note that you can�t hold rupees in your Revolut account, but you can spend in rupees on the ground in India.)
If you�ve got some cash on you in addition to this, you�re all set.
However you pay in India, expect a human touch with every transaction � Mayur Kakade / Getty Images
Money really isn�t everything in India
For the most part, Indians are generous people (as an Indian, I can make this sweeping generalization!), and I�ve gotten by on the kindness of strangers here more times than I care to publicly admit. There�s an entire culture and way of thinking built around the idea that our financial transactions are about more than just exchanging currency for something in return. They�re human.
Just the other day, I was out for a walk sans cash when a roadside florist insisted I take home some orchids I called pretty in passing. �Pay me back whenever,� said the vendor.�
I paid him back the same day�� but my point is that people here are kind and understanding when it comes to money-related things. I wouldn�t take anyone�s kindness for granted, obviously � but don�t let limited payment options put you off traveling all over India, either."
Travel,150,I�m a woman who loves traveling solo. What should I know about India?,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/female-solo-travel-india-tips,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2023-10/help-me-LP-india-solo-female.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,20-10-23,Are you a woman considering a solo trip to fabulous India? Read on for some essential tips and guidelines for traveling in comfort and safety.,I�m a woman who loves traveling solo. What should I know about India?,"In this series, Lonely Planet�s team of writers and editors answers your travel problems and provides tips and hacks to help you plan a hassle-free trip. We asked Mumbai-based LP editor Akanksha Singh � a self-confessed control freak who finds traveling solo the ultimate in freedom ��to field this question.
Question: ??I am 27 years old and have traveled solo on my own in Europe and North America. Next year, I am planning a month-long trip to India, and am wondering if you have any tips for a female solo traveler?
Akanksha Singh: A cheesy quote graffitied on a wall outside a stoner cafe in Rishikesh some has stayed with me over the years: �You don�t visit India. India visits you.� In other words,�India is an experience that aches as much as it thrills. And if you haven�t traveled much outside the Global North, I�d say this is doubly true.�
Yet from the velvet beaches of Andman and Nicobar to the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, it�s one of the few places where you can travel at your own pace, at any budget. You can hole yourself away in a lakefront cabin in verdant Maharastra, trek the unspoiled Markha Valley�or immerse yourself in mythology in Hampi.�
While it�s hard to condense all the safety dos and don�ts for a country this big and diverse, here are a few tips to get you started.�
Line up cell-phone coverage right when you arrive for maximum ease and safety � Sajjad Hussain / AFP via Getty Images
Sort out your communications right when you arrive�
The best safety measure for solo travelers? A local prepaid SIM card. This will help you make train bookings and use transport apps like Ola and Uber (which sometimes offer rides between cities, too), among countless other tasks. Owing to security concerns, there�s very little free public wi-fi in India. Data plans in India are, however, largely affordable (as low as $2 for 1GB a day), which means you can stay connected throughout your trip without denting your budget.�
You can pick up a local SIM card as soon as you arrive in India, even at the airport. To do so, you�ll need to carry an unlocked phone, photocopies of your passport and some passport-sized photos. Despite the country�s efforts to �go digital,� getting a SIM is still a paper-heavy process � so prepare to be patient.
Take note of emergency numbers should you need them: 100 (for the police) and 181 (a dedicated women�s helpline).�
Budget well � some upgrades are worth it
The sad reality of traveling in India is that you�re likely to be safer if you pay top rupee for certain essentials, such as accommodation and transport. If you�re traveling long distances by train, consider splurging out on an air-con first class (1AC) ticket, which comes with seats that convert into beds and compartments with lockable doors.�
Before you get into a taxi or auto rickshaw, ensure the driver will charge you by the meter, and don�t let them pick up strangers to carpool on your ride � if they do, get off. And your mother was right: never accept rides from strangers.�
Women in India tend to wear loose-fitting clothes that cover much of their bodies, even at the beach ��Fr�d�ric Soltan / Corbis via Getty Images
Dress modestly�
Dress codes vary by Indian destination. While it�s best to take your cue from locals, as a general rule of thumb, if you�re somewhere hotter, opt for loose-fitting linen and cotton t-shirts and trousers. Also carry a scarf or sarong to cover up further if needed at holy sites, and note that few Indians wear swimwear to beaches (you�ll even see some women swimming in saris).
Consider easing into the more touristy spaces
For your first taste of urban India, start in Mumbai. As a Mumbaikar, I�m biased, it�s true � but I�ve got data to back this up. Mumbai is the second-most-honest city in the world (after Helsinki), safer for women than other Indian cities and a great place to get your overall bearings.
If you�re an especially nervous or inexperienced traveler, consider traveling India�s south and northeast first. I�m by no means suggesting you restrict yourself geographically; if we women did this, we�d never leave the safety and comfort of our homes. However, parts of northern India � particularly more-visited places like Agra, Jaipur and Delhi � are harder to navigate as a solo traveler.
If you have second thoughts, there are always women�s travel groups you can look into joining for part of your time here. I�ve never used one, but friends who have recommend them, and have even formed lifelong friendships through them.��
If a train has a dedicated car for women, find a seat there � PradeepGaurs / Shutterstock
Seek out women-only spaces wherever they�re available�
In an effort to equalize against a largely conservative, patriarchal society, women are offered a few �perks� in India. Wherever these are available, use them: the ladies� compartments in trains; �family� spaces in restaurants; women-only queues at ticket counters, post offices, etc.�
Trust your instincts
It�s a clich� because it�s true: there�s no substitute for going with your gut. This is a country of over a billion people, so everything is scaled up � from scams to incidents of sexual harassment.
For the most part a firm, loud �no� can rebuff unwanted male attention. That said, it�s best to avoid revealing you�re traveling alone. In fact, if you want to, you�re welcome to steal one of my many fake male friends and boyfriends I�m on my way to meet and who I always happen to be on the phone to whenever I�m on assignment somewhere new: Ravi, Rohan (he�s trained in jiu-jitsu), Raj, Rishi, Rishabh..."

A summer escape to apple-growing hinterlands of Himachal Pradesh: Kothkai
Puneetinder Kaur Sidhu grew up in the plains of Punjab and has had a life-long romance with the Himalayas.
Nestled in the apple-growing region of the Lesser Himalayas, Kotkhai is my summer escape from urban chaos. Just 70km (44 miles) away from Shimla, the capital of�Himachal Pradesh,�this rural idyll is dotted with traditional slate-roofed wooden houses, and has been over 30 years since my first visit as a college student. To this day, I regularly return for a fix of quiet. Misty valley views, fruit-laden orchards, lazily chomping cows and crowing roosters are an added bonus.
I usually stay at the family-run Himalayan Orchard, a farm-stay perched at the top end of a sprawling apple orchard in Rukhla village.�It�s embraced by a dense deodar (Himalayan cedar) forest, with numerous well-marked hiking trails to explore. During my downtime here, I indulge in foraging for mushrooms, picking fruit, perusing a well-stocked library or simply savoring the sunset over the valley with my favorite sundowner in hand.
The sustainable farm-fresh food is yet another big draw of Himalayan Orchard. I suspect I return as much for the local specialty siddu, a steamed jaggery or lentil-filled bun paired with ghee (clarified butter), as I do for the home-grown crunchy greens, herbed sausages, home-made jams, freshly baked bread and artisanal cheese.
When visiting, set aside expectations of resort-like activities. Instead, depending on the time of your visit, consider driving up to Shararoo Pass for an unparalleled view of the Jorkandan, Chanshal and Swargrohini peaks. Take the opportunity to connect with the nomadic Gujjars (cowherds), who establish their camps in these hills during the summer months. You might also chance upon a vibrant fair held in honor of the village deity.

Snow-clad peaks and glacier-fed lakes in the Indian Himalayas: Munsiyari
Shivya Nath grew up in Dehradun, and is a travel writer and sustainable tourism consultant.
Having grown up in a valley at the base of the Indian Himalayas, I share a bond with these mountains that no amount of globe-trotting can sever. The one region that keeps calling me back is Munsiyari, in my home state of Uttarakhand. Situated close to the Tibet and Nepal borders in the Greater Himalayan region, Munsiyari is accessible by a winding 11-hour drive from the nearest train station (in Kathgodam) and airport (in Pantnagar) � which means it remains off the radar except to slow travelers, nature lovers and serious hikers from across India.
Those who do make the long journey are rewarded with breathtaking views of the five snow-clad Panchachuli peaks, forest bathing in the region's old-growth teak forests, scarlet rhododendron blooms in the spring, the gushing glacier-fed Gori Ganga river, and hikes and treks for travelers of all abilities.
What draws me back year after year is a nature-based tourism initiative called Himalayan Ark. This program beautifully bridges the realms of conservation, sustainable livelihoods and tourism, presenting opportunities for home-stays led by local women and offering a unique chance to embark on hikes guided by high-altitude female guides � a rarity in the region and the tourism industry in general.
I�m always delighted to try traditional recipes here, like dubke, a stew made from locally grown black soybean; and bhang ki chutney, a spicy dip made with hemp seeds.
I often go back in the summer, when locals come together for the unique Himal Kalasutra Festival. This event is filled bird-watching excursions, film screenings and storytelling sessions, and culminates in the traditional Mesar Mela, featuring local folklore, music and dance. While the festivities are geared towards locals, travelers are wholeheartedly invited to join. Often, the difference between the two groups is hard to tell by the end.
Historic Alibaug combines coastal charm with standout cuisine and traditional culture � Getty Images
Old-fashioned fishing villages and standout cuisine: Alibaug
Meher Mirza is a food, travel and culture writer based in Mumbai.
A short ferry ride from Mumbai, Alibaug beckons to beach lovers like me. Yet beyond its coastal allure lies a rich history that blends indigenous roots with influences from the Buddhist, Rashtrakuta, Shilahara, Khilji, Maratha, Portuguese and British cultures.�
Alibaug�s fishing communities have developed a unique and under-appreciated� style of Maharashtrian cooking. Favorite regional specialities include�rakti (made from the congealed blood of goat), murya (seawater fish) and popti (poultry and vegetables slow-smoked in an earthen pot).
But since I can�t elbow my way into an Alibaug homestead, I settle for the unpretentious Sanman restaurant, where the chef�s Midas touch stretches to all things seafood: vividly spiced clams, a stack of bombil (Bombay duck) fried to cornflake crispness and, to finish, tiny packets of tender coconut jelly. The ever-reliable Kiki�s Caf� and Deli�serves up a feast�of Indian, Italian and Middle Eastern dishes.
As the number of wealthy visitors swells (even Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan has a bungalow here), the town has become increasingly dotted with upmarket stores, art galleries and restaurants.�Luxury villas, affordable short-term rentals and even a posh hotel property � the Radisson Blu � abound. Among the nicer places I�ve stayed at the�Villa Beira Mar, a pet-friendly poolside villa with five bedrooms (and rather eye-watering prices).
Alibaug�s beaches are beautiful, yes � but this is a great spot for history enthusiasts, too. Its landscape is adorned with crumbling structures, once formidable fortresses of the Marathas and Portuguese, now silent reminders of bygone eras. Among them, the 16th-century Revdanda fort, initially constructed by the Portuguese and later wielded by the Marathas and British, is especially worth a visit. Additionally, the town boasts a sprinkling of ancient temples and vernacular-style bungalows, adding to the rich historical tapestry.

A peaceful abode in the Kumaon Himalaya: Kasar Devi�
Shubham Mansingka is a travel blogger from Kullu Valley who loves offbeat adventures.
The Kumaon hills see their fair share of holidaymakers flocking to renowned hill station towns like Mussoorie, Nainital and Mukteshwar. However, nestled quietly near Almora, the cultural capital of Uttarakhand�s Kumaon region, you'll discover Kasar Devi, an unassuming town that remains a cherished secret among seasoned travelers.
My own journey to Kasar Devi began nine years ago, on a scorching summer afternoon when I was looking to escape the crowds on a long weekend.�Since that initial visit, I�ve returned countless times � and even spent a quarter of a year living in a charming forest cottage during the COVID-19 pandemic.
A stroll through Kasar Devi unveils breathtaking vistas of towering Himalayan peaks, including the majestic Mount Trishul and Nanda Devi, both soaring above 7000m (29,650ft). Here, every walk becomes a potential hiking adventure, with some leading to ancient temples, concealed waterfalls or even the chance to spot a graceful deer. I often stumble upon a peaceful green meadow during my explorations: the perfect setting for an impromptu picnic surrounded by nature�s beauty.
One of my favorite trails starts from Papershali, meanders through pine and rhododendron groves, and ultimately leads to the quaint farming village of Balta Badi, where the green fields glisten in the afternoon sunshine. An evening hike to the 6th-century Kasar Devi Temple is a must, where you can witness a breathtaking sunset after your prayers or moments of contemplation.
On my visits, I have stayed at accommodations ranging from rustic village guesthouses to stylish boutique properties. Yet it�s The Kumaon that stands out for me: a striking building that seamlessly blends bold modern design with traditional materials. The views are pretty special, too.
I�m drawn back time and again to the holistic resort Ayurvaid Kalmatia, and its fresh, made-to-order cuisine. After dining, you can enjoy a rejuvenating Ayurvedic treatments. Occasionally, I venture into Almora bazaar to relish local delicacies, including the irresistible baal mithai�and singhaudi, both signature sweets available at Kheem Singh Rautela Sweets."

Mettupalayam to Ooty (Udhagamandalam) on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway�
46km (29 miles), 3.5�4.75 hours
South Indian rail thrills don�t get more classic than catching the famous, Unesco-listed �toy train� into northern Tamil Nadu�s misty Western Ghats. Jade-green tea plantations, lush jungle, rushing waterfalls and far-reaching panoramas jostle for attention as the narrow-gauge, rack-and-pinion steam train rattles up into the Nilgiri Hills from tiny Mettupalayam, zipping through 16 tunnels and across 250 bridges. Eventually, it reaches the hugely popular hill station of Ooty, at 2240m (7350ft). There�s also a stop along the way at Coonoor, the Nilgiris� second hill station, resting at 1720m (5643ft). First opened in 1899 (and extended to Ooty in 1908), the NMR pulls in an often-lively domestic crowd, with people cheering as tunnels plunge you into darkness.�
The blue-and-cream miniature train leaves for Ooty every day at 7:10am and takes 4.75 hours on the way up; it makes its way back down to Mettupalayam at 2pm, a 3.5-hour journey. The best way to get to Mettupalayam is aboard the nine-hour overnight Nilgiri Express from Chennai Central (or hop on it at Coimbatore, which has an airport), arriving just in time at 6:15am.

Bengaluru (Bangalore) to Gokarna on the Karwar Express
711km (442 miles), 14 hours
Flights link Karnataka�s lively capital of Bengaluru with the coast in an hour or so � but then you�d be missing out on a spectacular slow-travel jaunt through the lush, biodiverse and unbelievably beautiful Western Ghats en route to Gokarna�s blissful beaches. Leaving Bengaluru�s Yesvantpur Junction station three days a week at 7am, the Karwar Express follows inland Karnataka�s so-called Green Route, which is known for its wild green forests, dense coffee crops and over 100 bridges. After reaching the low-key coastal town of Mangaluru (Mangalore), the train follows the coast north to Gokarna Road station, where some of South India�s most magical and relaxed beaches await on the doorstep.�
If you�d prefer an overnight train to the beach, catch the daily Panchaganga Express at 6:50pm from Bengaluru City station, which drops you at Gokarna Road 12 hours later.�

Chennai to Rameswaram on the Rameswaram Express
665km (413 miles), 11 hours
Plodding across the 2km(1.25-mile)-long Pamban Bridge, with the Bay of Bengal swirling below, puts a whole new spin on riding the rails in South India. The bridge links mainland Tamil Nadu to Pamban Island, home to the small pilgrimage town of Rameswaram and the eerie ruins of Dhanushkodi (a once-thriving port destroyed by a 1964 cyclone), and marks the final stretch of a long overnight trip south from Chennai Egmore.�
Known as the Boat Mail Express in the 19th century, this train originally operated as part of a rail-and-ferry route linking Tamil Nadu with neighboring Sri Lanka (then under British rule as Ceylon), until the Pamban Bridge was opened in 1914. It�s also possible to travel by train across from the celebrated temple city of Madurai in southern Tamil Nadu; trains leave throughout the day from Madurai Junction (four hours).�
At the time of writing, rail services across the original century-old Pamban Bridge have been suspended while a new bridge is constructed, after safety concerns arose in 2022.�
How to book trains in South India
The best way to find out about South Indian train services is online via Erail, Indian Railways and/or Seat 61; this last resource offers invaluable advice on all things train travel�related in India, including buying tickets.�
Many trains sell out well in advance of their departure date, so it�s best to book as far ahead as possible, ideally online. Long-distance bookings currently open 120 days beforehand. Most comfortable for overnight travels are the reserved air-conditioned classes (1AC, 2AC or 3AC). The easiest way to reserve is through a booking portal such as Cleartrip or 12Go. The IRCTC government website also takes online bookings, but it can be a frustratingly fiddly process. On the ground, major train stations in places like Mumbai and Chennai usually have dedicated ticket counters for foreign travelers. Read more about how to get around India by train here."

To get you started, here are the top things to eat and drink in India.",What to eat and drink in India,"The food of India is one of the world�s great gastronomic experiences.
Such an accolade is thanks, in no small part, to its lavish palette of spices, which made the nation�s fortunes back in the days when strong flavorings were worth as much as gold. India is the home of peppercorns, cardamoms, turmeric, and cinnamon (shared with neighboring Sri Lanka) and dozens of Asian cuisines partly owe their existence to India�s seasoning know-how.

Explore the planet's most surprising adventures with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.
In fact, Indian cooking is not one cuisine but many, drawing on the myriad cultures, customs, and microclimates in this vast country. What is known ubiquitously outside India as �curry� is actually thousands of different dishes, grouped under one umbrella name taken from the Tamil word kari, meaning �spiced sauce�.
Here�s a guide to the best things to eat and drink in India.
Enjoy all-you-can-eat rice with (almost) every meal
Raised on paddy fields as green as emeralds, rice is the national food of India, especially in South India. In thalis � plate meals with multiple sauces � you�ll normally be given a choice of rice or various kinds of flatbreads. Either way, this serving of starch is often bottomless, and servers may come around offering top-ups of sauces, too.
Most rice is white � often the famous basmati rice exported from India around the world � but you�ll find regional variations, from Assam�s sticky rice to the red rice of Kerala in the south. Rice is typically boiled, but you�ll often find it served as pulao � spiced with vegetables � or as biryani, traditionally steam-cooked with spiced meat in a sealed pot in what is known as the dum puhkt style.
Also look out for jeera rice, mixed with cumin seeds (delicious with a dollop of natural curd) and South India-style lemon rice, which partners well with fish. Then there�s the ubiquitous fried rice served by India�s Chinese restaurants � a low-spice option that children often prefer.
Where to try it: Various cities claim to produce India�s best biryani, but Hyderabad has one of the most convincing claims. Sample it at diner-packed, no-frills Hotel Shadab, or its closest rival, expanding local chain Paradise.
Chapatti (flat bread) is popular in north India � hadynyah / Getty Images
Break bread the Indian way
While rice is paramount in the south, wheat-based flatbreads are the favored starch in the north. Roti is the generic term for Indian-style bread, and the word is used interchangeably with chapati to describe the most common variety � an unleavened disc made with wholewheat flour and cooked on a tawa (hotplate). After cooking, the chapati may be smothered with ghee (clarified butter) or oil. In some places, you�ll find rotis � bigger and thicker than chapatis and sometimes cooked in a tandoor oven.
A more indulgent version is the paratha, a layered, butter-rich, pan-fried flatbread, which also comes stuffed and makes for a hearty and popular breakfast. Another one for fried food fans is puri � puffy fried-bread pillows that can be as small as your hand or as big as a dinner plate, served as a sauce soaker-upper.
The plump Punjabi naan is a larger, thicker bread, baked in a tandoor and usually eaten with meaty sauces or kebabs (it also comes stuffed, though more commonly, it�s slathered in ghee). Around Amristar, look out for naan-like kulcha, flavored with herbs and spices and sometimes bonus ingredients such as pomegranate seeds.
Where to try it: The dhabas (roadhouses) of Punjab are the best places to seek out flavorsome Indian bread. In Amritsar, head for Kesar Da Dhaba and Bharawan Da Dhaba, both feted for their excellent house kulcha.

Indian food is dhal-icious!
The whole of India is united in its love for dhal (curried lentils or pulses). You may encounter up to 60 different pulses stewed into various spicy concoctions. The most common are channa (chickpeas), tiny yellow or green lentils called moong (mung beans), salmon-colored masoor (red lentils), ochre-colored tuvar (yellow lentils, also known as arhar), rajma (kidney beans), urad (black gram or lentils) and lobhia (black-eyed peas).
Where to try it: To start the pulses journey, seek out chole bhature � a tasty stew of spiced chickpeas served with puri � in the backstreets of Old Delhi, at standing-room-only Sita Ram Diwan Chand in Paharganj.
Feast on the meaty flavors of Mughlai cuisine
The Mughal Empire ruled over northern India for more than two centuries, leaving an indelible mark on India�s architecture, culture, and cuisine. Those meaty Indian curries that are served the world over have their origins in the food served in the courts of Mughal emperors, enhanced, refined and reinvented over the centuries. The meaty cuisine of Chettinad, a Muslim region in South India, is also highly celebrated.
Some curry dishes may be familiar � chicken tikka masala was actually invented in England and reimported to India � but you�ll also see curries named for the pot they are cooked in, such as chicken karahi, made in a wok-like metal pan. Then there�s butter chicken, a Mughal-inspired sauce invented in Delhi, with lashings of pureed tomatoes and ghee.
Chicken, lamb, mutton, and sometimes goat are the main meats used in Indian cooking; eating beef is taboo for devout Hindus and eating pork is taboo for Muslims. Some curries are hot, some are sweet, some are sour with tamarind, and others are infused with strong flavors of pepper, cloves, mustard, star anise, and fenugreek.
The Mughals were also responsible for India�s rich menu of kebabs � many prepared succulently moist in the tandoor (clay oven). Tandoori chicken is just the gateway to a whole world of grilled meats, from minced lamb seekh kebabs to sausage-like lamb kakori kebabs and yoghurty, nutty chicken reshmi. The artfully spiced kebabs of Awadh (Lucknow) and Hyderabad are particularly celebrated.
Where to try it: Butter chicken is one of India�s favorite dishes, so why not sample it at the restaurant where it was invented � Moti Mahal in Delhi. Continue the carnivorous journey in the lanes by Delhi�s Jama Masjid mosque, where Karim�s has been serving rich mutton burra to worshippers for more than a century.

Curds, milk, ghee, and chhena (or why India gives cows such respect)
Milk and milk products make a huge contribution to Indian cuisine � indeed, it�s part of the reason the cow is so revered in Indian culture. Dahi (curd) is commonly served as a side dish and it�s great for taming heat. The most common place you�ll encounter curd is as part of a lassi � a thick, yogurt drink that can be sweet, salty, flavored with mango, or even laced with marijuana.
Ghee (clarified butter) appears in almost everything, and paneer (a semi-firm Indian cheese) and chhena (cottage cheese curds) are useful protein sources for vegetarians. Milk, ghee and chhena also form the basis of many Indian sweets and other desserts.
Where to try it: You�ll find lassis served almost everywhere, but people speak in hushed tones of respect about those served at Blue Lassi at Kachaudi Ghat in Varanasi.
Seafood on both of India�s coasts
India has around 7500km (4660 miles) of coastline, and seafood is a staple ingredient in coastal areas, especially on the stretch of the west coast running south from Mumbai. Kerala and Goa are both known for their succulent prawns and fiery fish curries, and the fishing communities of the Konkan Coast � sandwiched between Goa and Mumbai � add more fish dishes and crabs to the mix.
Saltwater fish is also popular on the east coast around Odisha (Orissa), while bony estuarine and freshwater fish feature prominently in the cuisine of West Bengal. You�ll find more fishy treats on the far-flung Andaman Islands, where the cuisine starts to lean towards Sri Lanka and the islands of Southeast Asia.
Where to try it: The backstreets of central Mumbai are dotted with celebrated restaurants serving the seafood cuisine of the Konkan Coast. Try local favorite Mahesh Lunch Home near the Flora Fountain.
Indian pickles, chutneys and chaat
Pickles and chatnis (chutneys) are accompaniments that add extra zing to meals and form the key flavoring in many kinds of chaat (Indian-style salad). A pickle can be anything from a tiny pickled onion to a delicately crafted melange of fruit, nuts and spices. Strongly flavored lime pickle is the default in many regions. Chatni can be sweet or savory and made from many different vegetables, fruits, herbs, and spices.
Where to try it: Mumbai seafront is a great place to try bhelpuri, a chaat made from chopped onion and coriander, tamarind chutney, puffed rice, and bhel (crisp noodles); find it at Juhu Beach and Girgaum Chowpatty.

Make your teeth tingle with Indian sweets
India has a wildly colorful kaleidoscope of sticky, squishy mithai (Indian sweets), most of them super sugary. Each year, an estimated 15 tonnes of pure silver is converted into edible foil to decorate Indian sweets, especially during the Diwali festival.
The main confectionery categories are barfi (a fudge-like milk-based sweet), halwa (made with vegetables, cereals, lentils, nuts, or fruit), ladoos (sweet balls made with gram flour and semolina), and sweets made from chhana (unpressed paneer). There are also simpler offerings such as crunchy jalebis (coils of deep-fried batter dunked in sugar syrup) and petha (candied ash gourd) that you�ll find in many parts of the country.
Kheer (called payasam in the south) is one of the most popular desserts � a creamy rice pudding with a light, delicate flavor. Other favorites include falooda (a sweet rose milkshake with rice noodles), hot gulab jamun (deep-fried dough soaked in rose-flavored syrup), and refreshing kulfi (Indian-style ice cream).
Another end-of-meal palate-cleanser in India is paan, a fragrant mixture of betel nut (also called areca nut), lime paste, spices, and condiments wrapped in an edible, silky betel leaf. Ask for mitha (sweet) paan rather than saadha paan (which includes tobacco).
Where to try it: Kolkata is a great place to try sweet Indian treats. Seek out the Nobin Chandra Das & Sons sweetshop in the Sobha Bazar, founded by the family that invented rasgulla � soft cheese balls soaked in sweet syrup.
Start the day right with a South Indian breakfast
The breakfast treats of South India have been exported all over the country, and you�ll find dishes such as the dosa (rice and lentil-flour pancake, often stuffed with spiced vegetables and sometimes as large as a rolled up newspaper) on pretty much any street in India. Dosas come in myriad forms, but the potato-stuffed masala dosa is the most popular incarnation.
Other popular breakfast snacks include idli sambar (a steamed rice cake made from fermented rice and lentils) and vada (spiced, lentil-flour donuts). All are usually served with a bowl of hot sambar (a soupy tamarind and lentil sauce) and another bowl of cooling coconut chatni (chutney).
Where to try it: If you�re seeking a low-cost South Indian breakfast, head to the nearest railway station canteen, or seek out a branch of Indian Coffee House, a nostalgic chain run as a cooperative and staffed by waiters in turbans and cummerbunds.
Feast on India�s fabulous street food
Whatever the time of day, you�ll find street-food vendors frying, boiling, roasting or baking different delicacies to lure peckish passers-by. Vendors usually have one special dish that they serve all day � for example, fried bhajis and pakoras (fritters fried in gram-flour batter).
Fabulous examples include aloo tikki (spicy fried potato patties), gol gappa (puffed dough spheres with a spicy filling, also known as panipuri or gup chup), Mumbai�s vada pav (a fried potato dumpling in a bread roll), and Kolkata�s kati roll (a kebab rolled inside a paratha with onions and sauce).
Top tip: if locals are avoiding a particular vendor, you probably should too. Any place popular with families is likely to be your safest bet.
Where to try it: The alleyways of Old Delhi are famous for their street food delights. Start the adventure on Chandni Chowk, the historic Mughal-era bazaar running down to the Red Fort, where Old Famous Jalebi Wala has been serving sweet fried dough swirls for a century. Nearby, the lane known as Parantha Wali Gali is lined with vendors selling stuffed parathas.

Share a tipple with the locals
Indians are not huge consumers of alcohol, partly for religious reasons. Some states or regions are dry, or dry at certain times, such as during religious events. However, there�s a growing enthusiasm for wine and spirits in larger cities, and also the state of Sikkim, where many of India�s licensed liquor producers are based.
Indian beers tend to be strong, fizzy lagers, but some craft beers are edging into the market. Indian wine from the hills around Nashik near Mumbai has a growing reputation. Indian spirits are nominally divided into whiskies, brandies, and rums but they taste similar; there�s not much to divide local vodkas and gins either. In Rajasthan, seek out traditional royal liqueurs flavored with aniseed, cardamom, saffron, rose, dates, and mint.
Other traditional local drinks include mahuwa, distilled from the flower of the mahua tree in central India during March and April. Exercise caution if you�re not confident of its source: some producers of mahuwa adulterate the drink with methyl alcohol.
Rice beer is brewed all over eastern and northeastern India, while in the Himalayas you�ll find tongba, a warm beer prepared from millet, and a strong-grain alcohol called raksi. On the coast, especially in Goa and Kerala, you�ll find toddy, fermented sap from the palm tree, and feni, a spirit made from coconut or the fruit of the cashew tree.
Where to try it: You�ll find feni all over Goa, but Cazulo Premium Feni in Cuelim is the first feni distillery to offer tours where you can see the process and sample the finished product.
Vegetarians and vegans
Vegetarian and vegan food in India is abundant. Indeed, in the south of the country, �veg� (without meat) and �pure veg� (without meat or eggs) are the norm, while �non-veg� is relegated to backstreet status. Many Hindus are vegetarian, as are all Jains, some of whom are also vegan.
Milk products such as milk, butter, ghee, and curd are included in the majority of Indian dishes, so if you are vegan, your best bet is to seek out restaurants run by Jains. If in doubt, carefully explain your requirements. Big hotels and restaurants in larger cities are getting better at catering to vegans.
To sample South Indian vegetarian cooking in all its rich variety, the chain restaurant Hotel Saravana Bhavan is a local institution, serving delicious vegetarian thalis and other meat-free treats, with branches all over South India, including in Mylapore in Chennai."

Want to see Asian elephants or a snow leopard in the wild? Read on.,"The 8 best national parks in India for lions, tigers and bears","Half a century ago there were just five national parks in India, today there are more than 100. From the towering Himalayas and the plains of Central India to the Western Ghats and the world�s largest mangrove forests in the east, these wildlife reserves have been created to protect the abundance of wildlife, much of it endemic and endangered.
The numbers are staggering: India is home to 70% of the world�s tigers, 60% of its Asian elephants, plus more than 1360 species of bird, 600 reptiles and 400 mammals, many not seen anywhere else.�
Operated exclusively by the government and forest authorities, the national parks are a haven for vulnerable species like snow leopards, lions, and one-horned rhinos, and for tourists, a safari can be a great way to see each of them in their natural habitat. Plan your visit to India around these top national parks.�
Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand
Named contentiously after the British hunter and naturalist Jim Corbett, this is the oldest national park in India. Established in 1936, it spreads over 520.8 sq km of dense, deciduous forests in the Himalayas foothills and delights pantheists with its rolling hills, ridges and ravines, and vast expanses of savannah, open grasslands, swamps, and marshes.�
The forest groves of sal and sacred fig are native to the subcontinent and home to more than 600 species of birds. Aside from 50 species of mammal, the park is also home to leopards, elephants, sloth bears, spotted deer, langur monkeys, and gharials (fish-eating crocodiles). Tiger sightings are rare, but elephant herds are often seen amongst the verdant grasslands and near water.
A slew of outdoor adventures are on offer here, including river rafting and mountain biking. Ask your hotels or tour operator for details. The park's Corbett Museum can also give visitors an insight into the man himself.
Visiting Jim Corbett National Park
Some 260km northeast of Delhi, the closest town to Jim Corbett National Park is Ramnagar, 15km away. Visitors can stay at guesthouses inside the park, by booking online. Private resorts outside of the park can also assist with safari bookings. Book all day trips and 4WD safaris in advance.

Kaziranga Wildlife Park, Assam
Should you spot a crash of one-horned rhinoceros here, you've one person to thank: Baroness Mary Curzon. Spread along the plains of Brahmaputra River in northeast India for some 430 sq km, Kaziranga Wildlife Park is home to more than two thirds of the world�s population of these rhino, but they had been virtually wiped out until Curzon, the wife of the Viceroy, expressed her disappointment when she failed to spot a single rhino in the wild.
Curzon's persuasion led to conservation efforts with Kaziranga Reserve Forest formed in 1905. A century on, the park is not only home to rhinos, but is a breeding ground for wild elephants, water buffalos, and swamp deer. Tigers and leopards also lurk in the tropical broadleaf forests but are masters of disguise. Birdwatchers throng here to spot endemic and migratory birds such as Blyth's kingfishers and white-bellied herons.
Visiting Kaziranga National Park
Around 195km northeast of Guwahati, the main gate to Kaziranga National Park is at Kohora. Safaris must be booked in advance. The park is closed from May to October due to the monsoon. Forest guides accompany all tours and hiking is prohibited. A number of wildlife lodges outside of the park manage safaris.

Kanha National Park, Madhya Pradesh
The deciduous forests, towering sal trees, grasslands, and bamboo groves of this 940-sq-km national park were the inspiration behind The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling and Shere Khan, the Bengal tiger in the novel, is definitely the headliner here.�
Conversation efforts inside the park have brought the swamp deer back from extinction here and a road inside the forest takes its name from George Schaller, the conservationist who penned The Deer and the Tiger�about his experience.
Starting before dawn, take an open-topped 4WD safari through long holloways of tall sal and bamboo trees looking for wildlife such as langurs, sloth bears, leopards, wild dogs, and spotted- and sambar deer. The forest department can arrange 2km to 3km guided nature walks along buffer zones and banks of the River Banjar. These include birdwatching and occasional elephant sightings.
Originally home to the Baigas and Gonds tribal communities, the true guardians of the forests, you can visit their villages to better understand their rituals, customs, and traditions. Tours are conducted by Last Wilderness Foundation.��
Visiting Kanha National Park
Open October to June, the closest airport and railway station to Kanha National Park is 160km away at Jabalpur. It offers a number of tented camps, wildlife lodges, and luxury resorts. Safaris must be booked online in advance. Some private lodges organize guided walking and cycling trails.

Bandhavgarh National Park, Madhya Pradesh
Legend has it that Bandhavgarh, an ancient fortress in the Umaria District of Madhya Pradesh, is as old as the epic Ramayana itself. Sadly not accessible to travellers, the fort was believed to be built by Lord Ram for his brother, Lakshman. But that's not the only myth to swirl around these parts: a legendary white tiger was said to inhabit the forests here too. The last of the species, Mohan, lies stuffed and on display in the palace of Maharaja of Reva.
These erstwhile royal hunting grounds are now part of a national park, covering an area of 716 sq km of mixed deciduous forests and grasslands. Over 300 species of birds and 80 species of butterflies flit and fly about, while mammals, including tigers, leopards, sloth bears, Indian wolf, caracals, gaurs, langurs, and a variety of deer and antelope species can be spotted here.
For an aerial view of the park, there are hot air balloon safaris �available. On land though, tigers favour the Tala Zone. One of their hideouts is a 1000-year-old carved sculpture of a reclining Lord Vishnu under the canopy of a seven-headed snake. A small pool near the 11m-long carving is busy with wild cats, especially in summer. Badi Guha, a dark natural cave, is also a den for tigers and is home to bats. There are three zones in the main area of the park, with Tala the best place to head for wildlife sightings.
Visiting Bandhavgarh National Park
It is only possible to visit Bandhavgarh National Park from October to June as it closes during the monsoon season. The closest airports are Jabalpur (200km away) and Khajuraho (250km). Safaris have to be booked online in advance � tour operators and nearby resorts can assist with the bookings.�
Tigers and leopard are the highlights of Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan � Ondrej Prosicky / Shutterstock
Ranthambore National Park, Rajasthan
Forts are integral to Rajasthan's landscape and a crumbling bastion forms the very nucleus of this national park. Covering some 1334 sq km of deciduous forests and grasslands, the park was the former hunting grounds of the Jaipur Maharaja, who built Sawai Madhopur, the park's main entrance town. The royal hunting lodge is now a premium hotel.�
Tigers and leopard are the highlights here, but you're more likely to spot water buffalo, wild boars, striped hyenas, langurs, wild dogs, mongoose, and several species of deer. Tours are by open-top jeep and the three lakes that mirror the wilderness add a dash of magic to the tour.
Inside the park are a smattering of temples, havelis (mansions), vaults and water tanks, giving visitors a glimpse of the Rajput heritage. The ruins of this 1000-year-old site are scattered in the forests and are often used as hideouts for the big cats. On safari look out for the striking Jogi Mahal, a former hunting lodge, built in red sandstone as well as crumbling arches, pillars, domes, and broken steps, near the lakes, Raj Bagh Talao and Padam Talao. The forest department also offers bird-watching and crocodile safaris.�
Visiting Ranthambore National Park
Located 175km from Jaipur, Sawai Madhopur is the closest town to Ranthambore National Park, at 14km away. Divided into ten core zones, permits and safaris for the park must be booked online. Accommodation is available in the town and around the park, but not inside.

Gir National Park, Gujarat
Welcome to the lion's den. This 1412-sq-km park is king of the jungle territory. Once the private hunting lodge of the Nawab of Junagadh, a former princely state in present day Gujarat, lions were hunted here by royalty during the British colonial era � only for them to realise that there were hardly any left. A small sanctuary for these big cats eventually led to the creation of this national park.
There is nothing more thrilling than an early morning safari in the thick wooded area, where a deafening roar can suddenly jolt you out of your stupor or a glimpse of the golden mane between the trees can send a chill down your spine. There are no other wild cats vying for your attention here. Even the leopards are elusive. But when you are in the land of the lions, you rarely look elsewhere.�
Gir is home to about 40 species of mammal and 300 species of birds, too. You may encounter the different species of deer, antelopes, gazelles, jackals, and langurs. If you want to see lions, they're often found by watering holes, sometimes with lionesses and cubs. The park was once home to indigenous Maldharis and Siddhis tribes, but they have been relocated to villages outside the sanctuary. It is possible to book trips to see their villages, temples, and dances; ask your tour operator or hotel about what is possible.
Visiting Gir National Park�
Some 165km south of Rajkot, the best place to book a Gir National Park safari is in Devalia. The park has several designated zones and safari routes. Permits can be booked online, though a number of resorts outside of the park can manage tours too. The park is closed mid-June to mid-October due to monsoon season.
Hemis National Park, Jammu and Kashmir�
The �Ghost of the Mountains� silently wanders in the impenetrable high-altitude mountains of Ladakh, a master of disguise camouflaging with the snow and ice of Hemis National Park. The haunt of the elusive snow leopard is the largest national park of India, covering 4400 sq kms of alpine forests across the Karakoram�West Tibetan Plateau. Nestled at altitudes that range from 12,000 and 20,000ft, this Palearctic realm is one of the eight biogeographic realms of our planet.
Named after the ancient Hemis Monastery, this park boasts the highest density of snow leopards in the world, but visitors will more likely spot the bharal (blue sheep), shapu (Ladakhi urial), the Great Tibetan Sheep, and Asiatic ibexes.�
Himalayan marmot, Tibetan wolf and the endangered Eurasian brown bear also call this vast steppe home. The Rumbak region is the best place for wildlife spotting. Look up to catch a glimpse of the Golden Eagle, the Himalayan griffon vulture, and several other birds of prey.
Many travelers come here to hike with the Markha Valley Trek a favourite, whilst professional mountaineers attempt to scale the Stok Kangri Peak (20,000ft) and the Kang Yatse Peak (21,000ft). As well as the 12th-century Hemis Monastery, there are several chortens and gompas in the park.
Visiting Hemis National Park
Leh is the closest airport to Hemis National Park with the main entrance at Chilling, though there are gates at Stok, Zingchen, and Martselang too. Permits are required to enter the park and local tour operators organize treks here. Only locals are allowed motorized vehicles inside the park.
Nagarhole National Park, Karnataka
In Kannada, the local language, Nagarhole translates to �snake river� and that's exactly what the River Kabini does through this wonderful south Indian park, it swoops and curls through the forests of Bandipur and Nagarhole.�
Memories of elephants throng the river banks, sometimes in huge congregations during the summer. Carpeting some 848 sq km of the Western Ghats, including the foothills of the Brahmagiri Hills, this park is part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and shares its borders with the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary.�
The former hunting grounds of the Mysore Maharaja, the park now focuses on conservation projects. Safaris can be very rewarding here with elephants, wild dogs, sloth bears, gaurs, wild boars, tigers, and leopards all commonly sighted. Several species of deer, langurs, and monkeys are often sighted too, particularly along the backwaters of the Kabini. Birdwatching is a delight with a blend of both water and woodland birds, alongside several migratory species each winter. Crocodiles and snakes are regular sights as well, making this a great all-rounder for wildlife fans.
Visiting Nagarhole National Park
Around 80km from Mysore, safaris and stays at Nagarhole National Park are arranged by the forest department, though Kabini River Lodge � an erstwhile royal hunting lodge � can sort 4WD safaris, nature walks, boat rides, and river safaris inside the park for their guests. There are several luxury wildlife resorts located around the Kabini backwaters where travelers can stay.�

Silky-sand Goa and backwater-laced Kerala are the country�s beach queens, but there are plenty of other seductive Indian sands worth seeking out.�The fast-growing surf scene will delight travelers keen to ride the waves; diving, snorkeling, kayaking, paddleboarding and countless other water sports cater to active souls; and there are endless opportunities for toes-in-the-sand sun salutations in the birthplace of yoga.
Although local clean-up initiatives are on the rise, India�s ongoing beach-pollution issues often mean plastic and toxic waste washing up across the country. Do your bit by exploring responsibly, supporting sustainably run businesses and joining beach-cleaning projects. These are India�s best beaches.
Gokarna, Karnataka
Surrounded by palm-forested headlands on Karnataka�s isolated far-north coast, Gokarna�s luscious sand-and-rock coves have morphed into some of India�s most beloved beaches, yet still retain their laid-back, off-grid beauty.
South from spiritual Gokarna town (a major pilgrimage destination), honey-hued sand ripples into the turquoise Arabian Sea, with perfect swimming and fuss-free guesthouses, like Namaste Yoga Farm, mingling with surf schools, yoga shalas, swaying hammocks, kayak-hire shops and more. Golden-blonde Kudle�and Om Beaches�sit 5km (3 miles) south of town; from Om, you can walk along a coastal path to roadless, escape-it-all Half Moon Bay and Paradise Beach.�
Thottada & Bekal, Kerala
Northern Kerala�s Malabar Coast, between Kozhikode (Calicut) and the Karnataka border, remains blissfully unexplored. Head for secluded Thottada Beach, just south of Kannur, where a low-key homestay scene has grown up overlooking powder-soft golden sands, and days start with Keralan breakfasts at family-owned addresses like Blue Mermaid and Costa Malabari. From November to April, you might be welcomed at a local theyyam, an ancient temple ritual performed in a sacred grove.�
Further north, the Bekal area has a sprawling 17th-century fort overlooking miles of flaxen beach, and a few exquisite top-end hotels including sustainability-driven dream Neeleshwar Hermitage. Kerala�s untouristed northern backwaters trickle inland � savoring the calm, sunrise glow aboard a thatched-roof kettuvallum (houseboat) here is unforgettable.

South Goa
Goa�s mellow southern beaches rank among India�s most beautiful, though they�re no secret. Feasting on deliciously spiced seafood, trying out water sports, lazing in rainbow-colored beach huts and catching the sunset are the draws, making South Goa a delight for families, backpackers, couples or anyone keen to just relax on the sand.
Almost on the Karnataka border, Palolem is one of Goa�s dreamiest beaches � a sun-yellow sweep lapped by calm waters perfect for kayaking, swimming and paddleboarding, with a buzzy yoga scene, seasonal beach-hut accommodations and endless activities, such as Goan-cooking courses and organic-farm visits.
Lovely neighboring Patnem has more of a go-slow feel, and its own clutch of bamboo huts and yoga escapes. A few kilometers further north sits serene, family-friendly Agonda, a delectable stretch of golden sand framed by coconut palms, stylish beach huts and a bit of surf; walk over to lagoon-fringed Cola Beach, one of Goa�s more hidden-away delights.
Kovalam (Covelong) & Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram), Tamil Nadu
For a taste of South India�s thriving surf scene, don�t miss the once-sleepy fishing village of Kovalam, 30km (19 miles) south of Chennai (Madras) along Tamil Nadu�s east-facing coast. The golden-beach scene here revolves around the pioneering Covelong Point surf school, founded back in 2012; now it hosts a music-surf-and-yoga festival each August and offers kayaking, paddle-boarding, diving, windsurfing and a B&B�too.
There�s more surf in Mamallapuram, 20km (12 miles) south of Kovalam, a beach-hugging pilgrim town and low-key travelers� hub, where a string of Unesco-listed Pallava temples and rock carvings create a magical backdrop to gleaming sands.
Havelock Island (Swaraj Dweep), Andaman & Nicobar Islands
Flung 1400km (870 miles) east of mainland India in the remote Andaman Islands, Havelock is a salt-scented, jungle-wrapped jewel, beloved for having some of the most spectacular beaches and diving in South Asia. Turquoise waves wash onto salt-white sand watched over by primeval forest, with bamboo huts and dive schools dotted along the eastern shoreline, and there�s wonderful snorkeling and swimming (though do check locally about crocodile warnings).
On Havelock�s southwest coast, unbelievably beautiful Radhanagar Beach�is a vision of silken sand and flaming sunsets, with a couple of upmarket hotels, including tourism pioneer Barefoot at Havelock. Or escape inland to chicly designed Jalakara. Getting here is half the adventure: fly into Port Blair, then it�s a two-hour ferry to Havelock.
Konkan Coast, Maharashtra
Venture almost to the Goa border to uncover the emerging southernmost reaches of Maharashtra�s Konkan Coast, where centuries-old forts loom over gold-black beaches shaded by coconut palms and casuarina trees.
Low-key Tarkali, just south of Malvan, is a fishing and cashew-growing area with a sun-soaked beach,� a growing number of guesthouses and the ruined 17th-century Sindhudurg Fort just offshore. There�s good diving to underwater caves, courtesy of the marine-biologist-led IISDA, along with other water sports, and you might spot dolphins. With flights to Sindhudurg airport launched in 2021, this pocket of Maharashtrian paradise just became much easier to reach.�
Varkala & Kovalam, Kerala
Southern Kerala�s twin beach towns, dotted on either side of Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), reveal some of India�s most popular sands after Goa � and for good reason.
Varkala combines a lively backpacker/surfing scene with the serenity of an important temple town. Rust-red laterite cliffs cascade down to a series of lemon-yellow beaches, with trinket shops, yoga schools and mellow restaurants precariously perched above. Stay at stylish Soul & Surf or buzzy Mad About Coco, head to sandy strands outside town for tranquillity and explore the nearby backwaters.�
Home to ayurvedic retreats, a candy-striped lighthouse and a trio of smooth, cream-colored beaches, Kovalam has a relaxed, tropical feel and wide-ranging appeal, with accommodations running from Mediterranean-vibe Paradesh Inn to sumptuous five-star Leela.�
Laid-back Mandrem�s gleaming-white sands offer a blissful escape from it all � Greg Elms / Lonely Planet
North Goa
From party vibes in Baga to yoga stretches in Mandrem, the action-packed northern half of Goa�s 160km (99-miles) coastline is crammed with striking beaches. While things here feel overly developed for some travelers, it�s still possible to escape the bustle by exploring with your own wheels.
Lively Anjuna is a slender strand bordered by cliffs and coconut trees, with a famous Wednesday flea market, while scenic Assagao, just inland, has become a mellow yoga hub known for its Portuguese-style architecture. Arambol (Harmal), Goa�s northernmost developed beach, has a budget-friendly feel beneath earthy-red cliffs, and laid-back Mandrem�s gleaming-white sands offer a blissful escape from it all, with yoga, beach-shack restaurants and huts overlooking a small river.
If you�re here for Goa�s nightlife, the party beaches of Vagator,�Calangute�and�Baga and keep things rumbling on, even during the off-season between May and October.
Puri, Odisha (Orissa)
In Puri, one of India�s holiest Hindu towns meets a beachy hangout for off-the-beaten-track backpackers on Odisha�s southeast coast.
Once a 1970s hippie-trail haven, the town centers on the unparalleled 12th-century Jagannath Temple, where devotees gather for the Rath Yatra festival (July/August). There's also a dynamic beach festival in November.
The wide, dusty-blonde beach is dotted with fishing boats, though you�ll find umbrella-shaded lounging space around the community-operated Model Beach. Within easy reach lie Konark�s unmissable 13th-century Sun Temple (with its erotic carvings), holy Bhubaneswar�and Ramchandi beach, home of the India Surf Festival.

Mandarmani, West Bengal
Strung along the steamy West Bengal coast, 150km (93 miles, or four hours� drive) southwest of Kolkata (Calcutta), Mandarmani fishing village has morphed into a relaxed coastal resort. The rolling, unpolluted, 15km (9-mile) sandy beach here melts into the distance, and is known for its populations of tiny sand bubbler crabs. Join the fiery east-coast sunrise to spot local fisherfolk bringing in the day�s catch, and explore neighboring sands like Digha and Tajpur.�
Marari,� Kerala
Often overlooked by travelers in the rush to explore the backwaters, central Kerala�s dazzling gold-tinged coastline is a beach-lover�s dream, particularly around increasingly popular Marari, north of Alappuzha (Alleppey). An endless white-gold beach trickles down to sunsets blazing over the Arabian Sea, and there�s a sprinkling of original places to stay, such as boutique-inspired Marari Villas. Just south, Kattoor retains its small-village feel, with empty sands and peaceful homestays.�
Rushikonda, Andhra Pradesh
One of only eight Indian beaches awarded a sustainability-focused Blue Flag, wild-feel Rushikonda is the loveliest stretch of sand in Andhra Pradesh. Backed by lushly forested hills, 10km (6 miles) northeast of lively Visakhapatnam, this curving, 3km-long (2-mile) yellow-gold strand is perfect for a paddle � though swimming is banned due to dangerous east-coast currents � and has surfboards and kayaks available to rent.

India's railways are the lifeblood of the nation � the veins and arteries that keep the country�s heart beating, snaking into nooks and crannies that no plane could ever reach, and keeping 1.38 billion people connected with friends and family.
From 10-minute commuter hops to epic four-day journeys across the subcontinent, there�s a train ride to suit every travel need and every budget. Penny-priced local trains transport millions across big cities such as Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai, while lavish luxury locos offer the chance to roll around the country in style.

With the windows down and doors flung open, India's trains offer a peek into the everyday workings of Indian life, crawling through dusty villages, winding up the lush slopes of forest-clad mountains and skimming beautiful coasts, bringing visitors within touching distance of drying laundry and coconut groves.
Onboard, you�ll find a microcosm of Indian society spread across eight different classes, from politicians and businessmen living it up in air-conditioned compartments to laborers sitting cross-legged on simple wooden benches. Affordable and relatively easy to book online, trains are also the most atmospheric way to explore India. Traveling by train is also a smart way to save money on hotels, with comfortable sleeper services connecting major cities nightly and meals often included in the ticket price.
Whether you're a committed rail enthusiast, or just dipping in a toe for the experience, here are the best train journeys in India.
The Deccan Odyssey�
Best luxury journey
Start � New Delhi; End � Mumbai; Distance � 1524km (947 miles); Duration � 7 nights 8 days
Standing out amongst the thousands of passenger trains that traverse the country every day, India's luxury trains roll languorously between major cities, their polished engines and gleaming livery glinting in the sun. For those who can afford it, it's the only way to travel.
Rail aficionados sing the praises of the extravagant Maharajas� Express, which comes with personal butlers, bejeweled dinner plates and onboard bathtubs, but a more affordable option is the Deccan Odyssey. This luxe service runs from the Indian capital to Ranthambore National Park, the Taj Mahal in Agra and Jaipur and Udaipur, continuing to Vadodara and the World Heritage Sites of Ellora and Ajanta before arriving in Mumbai eight days later.
Less a train ride, more a cruise on wheels, this elegant train rumbles through the night, with passengers waking in a brand new city every day, to be met by coaches offering local tours. However, it�s perfectly acceptable to sit out the organized excursions and explore by yourself on foot or by taxi, or just pull out a paperback and enjoy the peace and quiet on board.

Mandovi Express
Best all-round rail experience
Start � Mumbai CST; End � Madgaon Junction; Distance � 581km (361 miles); Duration � 11hrs 50mins
With the Sahyadri Hills rising on the left and the Arabian Sea sparkling on the right, the Konkan Railway is a textbook example of Indian railway engineering excellence. Flash floods, landslides and collapsed tunnels all failed to hinder the construction of this trunk line from Mumbai's famous Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj station (CST) to the beaches of Goa.
While numerous trains weave along this coastal route, the Mandovi Express stands out as a national treasure thanks to its scenic views and the legions of hawkers who wander the aisles vending freshly fried pakoras (vegetable fritters), hot samosas (fried savory pastries) and biryani in clay pots.
Eschew the air-conditioned carriages with tinted windows that obscure the views, and opt for a seat in third or general class, where a warm salty breeze wafts through the bars of open windows. With no glass between you and the scenery, you�ll get the best out of the experience, as the train navigates more than 2000 bridges and 92 tunnels, with coconut trees bending in the foreground and rivers gushing beneath the sleepers.

Darjeeling Toy Train
Best for families and steam enthusiasts
Start � New Jalpaiguri; End � Darjeeling; Distance � 84km (52 miles); Duration � 7hrs 20mins
Since the late 19th century, this dainty little ""toy train"" has been trundling slowly uphill to the Bengali hill station of Darjeeling. Seven hours after leaving the base of the hills, this pint-sized loco wails arrives in a cloud of steam and dark smoke, offering a trip back to an earlier century. Trucks and carts creep to a halt to allow the train to wind across Hill Cart Road, where the carriages glide so close to shop fronts that you can almost reach out and touch the piles of apples.
Built by the British colonial government, the railway was originally used to transport tea and rice down to the plains, but it�s now Unesco World Heritage listed and more commonly packed with holidaying families singing Hindi movie songs and cheering at particularly thrilling sections of track such as the Batasia Loop.
Every day, the train zig-zags uphill from New Jalpaiguri (NJP) through thick groves of bamboo and pine, working its way around rich green tea plantations before hooting into Darjeeling. The main service is usually pulled by a diesel engine, but two-hour joy rides chug from Darjeeling to Ghum and back tugged by steam locos. On a clear day, you may even spot the sun-kissed summit of�8586m (28,169 ft) Mt Khangchendzonga hovering on the horizon.�

The Dibrugarh�Kanyakumari Vivek Express
Best train ride for serious rail enthusiasts
Start � Dibrugarh; End � Kanniyakumari; Distance � 4154km (2581 miles); Duration: 74hrs 35mins
Leaving once a week on Saturdays, this is one epic train ride, taking passengers from Upper Assam in the northeast corner of the country all the way to Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, at the southernmost tip of India � the point where the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean meet. Making 57 stops in eight different states, this multi-day odyssey is a deep immersion into the verve and spirit of India's railways.
For the perfect combination of charm and comfort, book into a 2AC sleeper carriage � with open, four-berth compartments � and lie between clean white sheets watching students playing cards, mothers rocking babies in cradles tied from saris, and friends chatting over hot vadas (lentil-flour fritters) and endless cups of chai (sweet Indian tea). Take the opportunity to stroll up and down the 16 carriages to experience a microcosm of Indian society, and keep plenty of small denomination notes to hand for snacks, as hawkers rarely have change for big bills.
Island Express
Best for a quick taste of the Indian rail experience
Start � Thiruvananthapuram; End � Kanniyakumari; Distance � 87km/54 miles; Duration � 3hrs 20mins
By Indian standards, the Island Express is barely a local hop, but it�s a magical trip that takes passengers into the dewy depths of Kerala. For less than a dollar, passengers can stake out a window seat on this quiet country service that squeezes through the backwaters between Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala and Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, passing villages of sugar-pink houses and tiny whitewashed churches.
Waterlogged paddy fields roll by, skinny palms bend as if bowing, and the steam from the kitchens of trackside houses drifts through the open doors. You�ll want to sit right up against the windows (or in the open doorways) to snap photos of children playing street cricket, elderly men in dhotis (white sarongs) smoking rolled-leaf cigarettes and bullock carts rumbling alongside the rail tracks. Just watch out for the stray branches that thwack against the sides of the train, leaving broken twigs scattered up the aisles and tiny flowers scattered underfoot.
Pune�Hazrat Nizamuddin Duronto Express
Best train trip for a first-time overnight ride
Start � Pune; End � New Delhi; Distance � 1515km (941 miles); Duration � 19hrs 35mins
India�s sleeper trains vary widely when it comes to levels of comfort, with many services creeping along at a snail's pace and stopping noisily at local stations through the night � a definite hindrance to sleep! However, Duronto Express trains only stop at a tiny number of stations en route, using some of the country�s fastest trains, and they offer excellent meals and high standards of onboard service.
Recognizable by their bright green and yellow color scheme, these sleek and modernized trains are perfect for first-time night-riders looking to sample the Indian railway experience without the rough edges. Departing Pune just after 11am every day, the train speeds past rushing rivers, stretches of deserts, small mountains and serene villages.
There's much excitement in the middle of the day as lunch arrives on red plastic trays. Expect tomato soup with a breadstick and butter followed by foil-wrapped chapatis, steamed rice, dal, chicken curry, yogurt and pickles � and a small tub of vanilla ice cream for dessert. The meals loaded in Pune are the tastiest of the ride, but you'll also get a satisfying dinner and breakfast before rolling into Delhi's Hazrat Nizamuddin station, close to Humayun's Tomb.

Here is an introduction to the history and legends surrounding India�s most famous building, and tips for making the trip of a lifetime.
Where is the Taj Mahal?�
The Taj Mahal stands in gorgeous Mughal gardens in the Taj Ganj district of Agra, a historic but noisy city of four million people on the hot, dusty plains of Uttar Pradesh in northern India.�
Agra has a reputation as a hectic spot, but its historic wonders � not just the Taj, but nearby Agra Fort, and a string of other Mughal monuments � make it worth braving the touts, pollution, and persistent rickshaw drivers.
Agra is well connected by road, rail, and air. The easiest route from Delhi is the 6:55am 12280 Taj Express train, which reaches Agra in just three hours.�
What is the Taj Mahal?
The Taj Mahal is often described as the greatest monument built for love, but the Taj Mahal is actually a memorial to tragedy. When Mumtaz Mahal, the chief consort of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, died in childbirth in 1631, the heartbroken emperor devoted years and a considerable fortune to constructing a tomb worthy of his great love.�
The mausoleum was finally completed in 1648 after years of painstaking chiseling and carving by the most skilled craftspeople in the Mughal empire. The queen consort was interred inside in a private chamber at the heart of the monument and Shah Jahan was later buried alongside his wife when he died in 1666.�
The Taj Mahal has many special features�
The riverside location reveals a lot
The Taj is tucked into a curve of the Yamuna River, a tributary of the sacred River Ganges, about 1.5km (1 mile) east of Agra Fort.�The rediscovery of the ""moonlight garden""�� built across the river from the tomb but later buried by silt � hints at religious connotations to the Taj�s riverfront location, with the tomb�s eight rooms representing the hasht bihisht (eight paradises) and the Yamuna representing the rivers of milk and honey that wait for the virtuous in the afterlife.�
The Taj is built with perfect symmetry
From its gleaming domes and filigree marble screens to its towering minarets, the Taj shows perfect bilateral symmetry along an axis running through the center of the main dome and the surrounding gardens. The only break in symmetry is found in the burial chamber, where the grave of Shah Jahan sits just to one side of the grave of Mumtaz Mahal set at the geometric center of the monument.�
The dome is remarkable
The elegant onion-dome atop the Taj Mahal is a perfect illustration of the complex geometry used in Islamic architecture. The base of the dome � which is almost as tall as the building below, and flanked by four smaller domes �� �is supported by eight angled ogive arches, allowing the transition from a square plan to a circular structure. �
The stonemasonry is a masterpiece
While it looks like it was carved from gleaming white marble, the Taj is a masterpiece of stone facing. Entombed behind intricately carved marble panels and perforated screens is a brick-and-lime mortar skeleton, but it cannot be glimpsed from any of the open areas of the monument. For insights into this style of Mughal architecture, check out Khan-i-Khanan�s Tomb in Delhi, which was stripped of its sandstone and marble veneer to build a tomb for a higher ranking Mughal dignitary.�
The Taj is covered in magnificent ornamentation
The Taj isn�t the only Mughal monument to feature pietra dura � intricate inlay work, made from semi-precious stones � but it is unquestionably the finest. While it shines brilliant white from a distance, up close the Taj is adorned with an elegant tracery of filigree scrollwork, leaves, flowers and Islamic motifs, executed in marble, jasper, lapis lazuli, carnelian, malachite, and other colored stones.�
The calligraphy around the 
Cultured calligraphy covers the four�pishtaqs
The four pishtaqs (arched recesses) on the four sides of the Taj are framed by passages from the Quran in intricate calligraphy made from strips of jasper inlaid into marble panels. The script increases in size as it climbs the walls of the monument, but appears to be a uniform size when viewed from the ground�� a testament to the complex architectural understanding of the craftspeople who built it.�
The gardens are heavenly
Everyone has seen the photos of world leaders posed at the end of the ornamental ponds in front of the Taj.�Both the main gardens inside the complex and the so-called moonlight garden on the north bank of the Yamuna River are built to mirror the charbagh, the four gardens of heaven. Note the influence of Islamic geometry ��flowerbeds are shaped like the rub el hizb (Islamic star) and water features split each quarter of the gardens into four equal parts.�
Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal's graves are elsewhere��
While the inlaid marble cenotaphs of the royal couple stand in an elegant space beneath the main dome, shielded by an octagonal perforated screen, these do not contain the bodies of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz. The actual graves of the emperor and his wife are hidden in an underground vault that has been closed to the public since the tomb was constructed.�
The minarets are deliberately angled�
Although they were never used for this purpose, the four towers marking the corners of the tomb were built as working minarets, with stairways and balconies allowing a muezzin to call the faithful to prayer. If you look closely, you�ll notice that the minarets are angled slightly outwards, allowing the towers to collapse away from the mausoleum in the event of an earthquake.�
The Taj is flanked by a mosque and its mirror image
To the west of the main mausoleum is an elegant red sandstone�mosque�that is still in use today, with two low minarets that sit almost flush with its roofline, so as not to distract from the grandeur of the Taj. The identical building on the east side of the tomb was constructed purely for symmetry; it was not suitable for prayer as it faces away from Mecca.�
The building's exterior is discolored due to pollution
The Taj still shimmers like it did in 1648, but up close, you may notice a yellow, green, and brown sheen, caused by toxic pollution from heavy industry and vehicle emissions in Agra. Despite government schemes to close factories and reduce traffic in the area around the Taj, and several attempts to clean the marble with ""face packs"" made from a fine clay that absorbs stains and other pollutants, the problem persists. In 2018, the Supreme Court issued an ultimatum to the Indian government to properly restore the Taj, or demolish it!�In response, the Archaeological Survey of India announced a six-month program of mud-pack facials for the main dome in October 2021.
The Taj has often been copied, but never equalled
Copies of the Taj Mahal have been built around the world. Constructed by Aurangzeb�s son Azam Shah in 1679, the Bibi-qa-Maqbara in Aurangabad, is an obvious tribute to the Taj, though much less refined. There are also modern reproductions of the Taj Mahal in Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the US, Brazil, Colombia, and several Gulf States.�

The story of�the Taj Mahal
The Taj didn�t spring into the world fully formed from the imaginations of its architects. Instead, it was the product of a generations-long process of architectural evolution, running throughout the Mughal period, with a string of earlier tombs marking the progress towards the Taj's funereal perfection.�
Agra�s Itimad-ud-Daulah, built for Mumtaz Mahal�s grandfather in 1622, features many of the same design elements as the Taj Mahal, but lacks its finesse and perfect proportions. The nearby tomb of the emperor Akbar, built in 1605, was another imperfect Taj prototype, making similar use of ornamental minarets and white marble inlays. However, both monuments were merely refinements of architectural ideas first established by the tomb of�Humayun, constructed in Delhi in 1569.�
There are many legends of the Taj...
Many myths have grown up around the Taj. It�s claimed, for example, that the craftspeople who built it�were mutilated so they could never build anything so beautiful again � though there�s no historical evidence for this. The same applies to the tale that Shah Jahan planned to build a mirror-image ""Black�Taj Mahal"" on the opposite bank of the Yamuna River.�
One story that is definitely true is that Shah Jahan was imprisoned in Agra Fort by his son, Aurangzeb, in a chamber with a view of the Taj Mahal� a torturous incarceration for the deposed emperor.�It�s also true that the Taj is tilting ever so slightly, as the changing flow of the Yamuna River has dried the soil beneath its foundations. We�re some centuries away from a Leaning Taj of Agra, however!
...as well as some controversies�
Some stories about the Taj are more controversial than others. Although no physical evidence has been discovered, some Hindu nationalists claim that the Taj was built over the desecrated ruins of a Hindu temple called Tejo Mahalya. There are even conspiracy theories about hidden doors protecting secret rooms full of looted Hindu treasures.�
There is some historical precedent for Mughal monuments being built over temples � Delhi�s Qutab Minar complex was built using stones from 27 destroyed Hindu and Jain temples � but claims about the Taj were publicly debunked in court in 2017 by the Archaeological Survey of India.�

Everything you need to know to plan your trip to the Taj Mahal
What is the best time to visit the Taj?
It is possible to visit the Taj Mahal year-round, but it�s much more pleasant to explore the monument during the dry winter months, from October to March. From April to May, temperatures soar, and the skies open up for the monsoon from May to September.�
How long do you need at the Taj?
Allow at least three hours to explore the mausoleum, gardens, and outlying buildings. Add in nearby Agra Fort and you�ll easily fill a day. Staying nearby in Taj Ganj will help you get to the gates ahead of the crowds.�
What are the opening hours of the Taj?
The Taj is open from dawn to dusk, from Saturday to Thursday (the complex is reserved for worshippers on Fridays). Technically, the Taj opens 30 minutes before sunrise, so arrive before this time to be first through the doors. For the latest information on opening, visit the Taj�s official website.�
When do night tours take place?
For five nights around the full moon the Taj is open between 8:30pm and 12:30am for special Night View tours. You only get to view the mausoleum from the edge of the compound, but it�s certainly a memorable way to see the Taj. Book tickets in advance through Agra�s Archaeological Survey of India office.�

How much does it cost to visit the Taj?
International visitors pay Rs 1100 entry, while Indian visitors pay just Rs 50, and visitors from SAARC and BIMSTEC countries pay Rs 540. For all visitors, there�s an optional Rs 200 to enter the mausoleum. Tickets are available online via the Archaeological Survey of India payment portal. There�s no charge for using a still camera, but for video cameras, there�s a Rs 25 fee.�
Where are the best places to stay nearby?
Accommodation close to the monument in the Taj Ganj district comes at a premium, but you might sneak a view of the Taj. At opposite ends of the price spectrum, the grand Oberoi Amarvilas and economical Saniya Palace Hotel both have stunning vistas of the mausoleum. However, you may have a cheaper and quieter stay if you pick a hotel near Sadar Bazaar or Fatehabad Road.�
What's the best way to travel around in Agra?
Rickshaw, autorickshaw and taxi drivers in Agra are notorious for charging elevated rates; haggle firmly for a fair price before you set off. For a fair fixed fare, try booking a ride-share through the Ola app, or use the prepaid desks at Agra Cantonment Train Station.�
What is the dress code and etiquette at the Taj Mahal?
The Taj Mahal is an active place of worship, so dress respectfully. Wear clothing that covers the upper arms and legs, and try not to be intrusive with your camera. Photos are prohibited inside the mausoleum, and tripods are banned completely. There are separate lines for men and women; food and tobacco are banned from the complex, and bags must be left in the free lockers at the west gate.�

Meet the woman making tourism more inclusive and accessible","On tours put on by India-based Planet Abled, people with various disabilities and those without disabilities travel side by side.��
When Neha Arora launched the inclusive tour operator Planet Abled almost five years ago, she was possibly the world�s least-traveled owner of a travel company. Besides a few weekend getaways in her native India, she had never ventured far from home.�
As a child, Arora, now 37, watched as her classmates in Agra went on family vacations and came home with stories of their escapades. Her outings were limited to school picnics or trips to see her grandparents in New Delhi. Family getaways never seemed like a real option. Arora�s father is blind and her mother uses a wheelchair: the logistical challenges of travel always felt insurmountable.

From frustration to inspiration
When Arora�s first passport expired, it was still blank. After finishing her engineering degree, Arora moved to New Delhi and began working at a telecommunications company. Eventually she saved enough money for her family to take a 10-day trip through South India in 2009. Money, she hoped, might overcome the travel barriers her parents faced. She was wrong.
""You travel 2000 miles only to realize that the place is not accessible or does not give you the kind of experience you would look forward to,� Arora said.��
After a particularly difficult incident on that South India trip, when an argument over accessibility escalated into a dangerous situation, her parents gave up on travel and Arora started searching for solutions. There were travel companies that catered to people with disabilities, but most of them focused on a single disability. Arora couldn�t find anything that would allow her to travel comfortably and safely with both of her parents.�
�I started talking to more and more people, and either they were not traveling at all or they were facing similar challenges,� she said. �I had to start a travel company to travel.�
Accessibility as inclusivity
Over one billion people � about 15% of the world�s population � live with some form of disability, according to the World Health Organization, from mobility and cognitive issues to being visually or hearing impaired. In addition, more than 2 billion people, including spouses, children and caregivers, are directly affected by disability.�
Despite this, accessible tourism, wherein everyone can take full advantage of travel facilities and services regardless of their physical limitations, disabilities, or age, isn�t the norm. Travel remains difficult for many people with disabilities, be it from a lack of information on accessible services, discrimination, or trouble finding accommodation that meets their needs. One recent study found that even in countries with the highest level of adaptation �generally countries with the highest per capita income �wheelchair accessibility is provided in only 30% of the hotels analyzed and accommodations such as Braille, tactile posters or audio guides are offered in 5% or less of cases.

Although Arora saw this gap early on, it wasn�t until 2016 that she felt ready to leave her job to start Planet Abled, with the goal of making travel more accessible for people of all disabilities. Initially, Planet Abled provided day trips in New Delhi, but it has since expanded to offer accessible group tours and customized trips in over 40 destinations across Europe and Asia. What makes Planet Abled unique is that their experiences are inclusive. �We mix people with various disabilities and nondisabled people to travel together,� Arora said. �So disability is just a human feature � it's not something that decides how you travel or where you travel.�
It can be tricky to consider adaptations for different disabilities, but Arora says Planet Abled�s approach leads to some unexpected surprises. On one trip, a blind man created software to communicate with a deaf woman instead of relying on a third person. On another tour, a nondisabled tourist told Arora that though they�d been to that place four times before, they now saw it in a whole new light. This isn�t uncommon, Arora says. Taking a longer route because of wheelchair access or focusing on the tactile experience because of a blind traveler in the group, for instance, can help travelers zero in on details they might otherwise miss.

Making accessibility mainstream
People in Planet Abled�s groups have also stayed friends after the trips. �You realize, �Oh, this person is just like me and they just happen to have a disability,�� Arora said, adding that sometimes nondisabled travelers will approach the company after their trips with questions about how to make their workplaces more accessible or how to hire a person with a disability.��
Anica Zeyen, a senior lecturer at Royal Holloway, University of London, discovered Planet Abled in 2019 when planning a fieldwork trip to India. Since it was her first time in the country, she reached out to the group about joining a day trip.
�I did not want to use just any travel company. I am blind and therefore the usual way of sightseeing doesn�t really work,� said Zeyen, who travels frequently for work and leisure. �I need people to describe things to me, be allowed to touch things and helped to navigate unfamiliar places.��
A blind traveler is guided through a map of Delhi's Red Fort � Courtesy of Planet Abled
On a 12-hour tour through Delhi with Planet Abled, Zeyen says her guide was well-trained in describing what Zeyen couldn�t see without being patronizing, something she says is unfortunately rare. He let her choose if she wanted to be sight guided (led by the arm) or walk next to him with her cane. She could also touch some of the monuments and Planet Abled printed 3-D models for some of the objects she couldn�t touch to give a sense of their proportion and shape.�
�At one point near the spice market in Old Delhi, we climbed up this narrow staircase to stand on one of the roofs to absorb the atmosphere,� Zeyen said. �I like that Planet Abled sees me as just another traveler who wants to explore the world, but who might just have to do things slightly differently.�
Arora now has multiple stamps in her passport, the first from 2018 when she visited Vienna, Austria, to accept an award from the United Nations for Planet Abled�s work. She has also expanded Planet Abled�s scope, consulting with governments, tourism boards, hotels, NGOs, and others, to provide advice on how to make travel more inclusive and accessible.�

Just the beginning
Arora says the industry has changed for the better since Planet Abled began. Back then, she says, when she approached hotels about accessibility issues they often blew her off, claiming that people with disabilities don�t travel. Now when she talks to hotel chains, they listen. �At least now there is reception to the message that this is the right thing to do.��
A 2020 study found that the disability travel market is growing. In 2018-19, more than 27 million travelers with disabilities took 81 million trips, spending $58.7 billion on travel (up from $34.6 billion in 2015). The economic impact is likely even bigger, since people with disabilities often travel with others.�
Planet Abled is building a platform to make its information about accessibility more widely available so people can plan their own trips and don�t need to rely on travel operators, which can be expensive. In the end, Arora says the aim is to have every travel company and destination be accessible, paradoxically making Planet Abled�s work irrelevant.
�Ultimately � this might sound ironic � you don't need a separate travel company for disabled people,� Arora said. �You want the whole industry to become inclusive and that�s what the goal of Planet Abled is: to make the planet able and inclusive for everyone to travel.�

From grand city events to simple village melas (fairs), India�s jam-packed festival calendar is as rich and diverse as its traditions and topography.
A star attraction on the Indian festival stage is Diwali � a joyous celebration that, broadly speaking, celebrates the triumph of good over evil. The festival�s name roughly translates to �row of lamps/lights� � which is why Diwali is widely known as the Festival of Lights.
�Diwali is incomplete without sweets and many boxes are gifted over the festival� �Lawrence Worcester/Lonely Planet
When is Diwali?
The festival takes place over a period of five days on auspicious dates during the end of Ashvin/start of Kartika � the Hindu lunar calendar months which equate to the Gregorian calendar months of October/November.�This year Diwali will be celebrated from Thursday, November 4, 2021.
While the festival undeniably takes centre stage, there is a particularly distinct air of happiness � and preparation � in the lead up to Diwali. Houses and shops are given a rigorous spring clean before being decorated with fairy lights, patterned lanterns and colourful rangolis/kolams (propitious rice-paste/powder/chalk designs adorning thresholds). The streets in pre COVID times teemed with shoppers keenly stocking up on everything from new clothes and festive household decorations, to gifts for family, friends.�
The� lighting of 
The most popular gift, by a long shot, is mithai (Indian sweets), with ornately packaged dried fruits and nuts also a hot seller. Shops are filled with a spectacular array of mithai specially prepared for this festival, from thickly cut squares of barfi (fudgelike sweet, often coated with a thin film of edible silver leaf) � old favourites include pista (ground pistachio nut) and kaaju (cashewnut) � to soft syrupy gulab jamuns (deep-fried balls of dough) and spongy rasgullas (sweetened cream-cheese balls flavoured with rose-water). Indeed, if there�s ever a time to experience India at its sweet � and convivial � best, it�s during Diwali.
Diwali's religious significance
Diwali is a national Hindu festival that is also embraced by other religious denominations including the Sikhs and Jains. As such, it entails religious and regional variations in the way it is celebrated. For Jains, Diwali signifies the attainment of moksha (liberation from the cycle of life and death) by Mahavira (the 6th century BC founder of Jainism�s central tenets). For Sikhs, Diwali largely denotes the 1619 release of Guru Hargobind (the sixth of Sikhism�s 10 gurus), along with 52 others, who had been detained in the Gwalior Fort by the Mughal emperor Jehangir.
When it comes to India�s major religious community, the Hindus, Diwali commemorates the victory of Lord Rama (King of Ayodhya, according to sacred Hindu texts, and also a prominent deity) over Ravana (a powerful demon) and his triumphant return to the kingdom after a period of exile. Keen to make Lord Rama�s homecoming as swift and safe as possible, his jubilant subjects illuminated the way with masses of twinkling diyas (earthenware oil lamps). It is for this reason the lighting of diyas has become a key component of the Diwali festival.
�Diwali comes from the Sanskrit word translating as 'rows of lighted lamps'��� Gulfu photography/Getty Images
It also symbolises the replacement of darkness (ignorance) with �inner� light � garnered via the pursuit of knowledge and spiritual practices. Indeed, spirituality lies at the heart of Diwali, with devotees specifically seeking blessings from two prominent Hindu deities: Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and Ganesh, the elephant-headed god of good fortune and auspicious beginnings. Worshippers pray for prosperity and well-being for the year that lies ahead, with fireworks and crackers and lanterns.

Here dramatic forested gorges rise to skylines of snow-capped glaciated peaks through a landscape that ranges from high-altitude desert to dripping rhododendron forest. 
Home to some 50 million people, this is no alpine wilderness, but rather a vibrant mosaic of peoples, cultures and communities, criss-crossed by ancient trading and pilgrimage routes that offer their own unique inspiration. Test your mettle against some of the world's most audacious and dangerous roads, or set a more measured pace on a trek through yak pastures to prayer flag-strewn passes haunted by snow leopards and red pandas.

Ladakh � India's little Tibet
Hidden over high passes in an arid, largely treeless rain shadow, Ladakh is classic Trans Himalayan scenery: huge khaki-colored valleys and harsh rock walls brought alive by the occasional splash of irrigated green. Traditional Tibetan Buddhist culture remains intact here, with spectacularly located monasteries that burst into life during medieval masked dance festivals that have changed little in 500 years. Travelers should expect�epic treks, sparkling high-altitude mountain lakes, and a well developed infrastructure with inexpensive guesthouses�around the capital, Leh.
When to go: June to September.
Getting there: Daily flights from Delhi to Leh, or take the spectacular seasonal high roads over the Himalayas from Manali or Srinigar.
Suggested itinerary: Hire a jeep or an Enfield motorbike and drive out to ancient Hemis, Lamayuru and Thiksey monasteries, taking a side trip to the turquoise lake of Pangong Tso bordering Tibet; afterwards, do a five-day homestay trek through the Markha Valley.
Off the beaten track alternative: Spiti, in neighboring Himachal Pradesh, has the same dramatic mountain scenery and monasteries but without the crowds. Trek from village to village with a local organization and overnight at the incredible monasteries of Dhankar and Tabo.

Tibet � roof of the world
The high Tibetan plateau is the rooftop of Asia, hidden from the Indian subcontinent behind the ramparts of the Great Himalaya. Despite Chinese-led modernization, Tibet's great monasteries still hum with murmured mantras and the flicker of yak butter lamps. Sublime landscapes, ranging from rolling grasslands to high-altitude turquoise lakes, a vibrant Buddhist culture and the friendly and resilient Tibetan people are the highlights here, as are the views of Everest's North Face � miles better than anything you'll see in Nepal.
When to go: Mid-May to September.
Getting there: Flights to Lhasa from�Chengdu, Beijing and many other cities in China, or take the world's highest train from China to Lhasa.
Suggested itinerary: Join a tour for the seven- to ten-day overland trip from Lhasa to Kathmandu, stopping at the incredible multistory stupa (structure containing Buddhist relics) at Gyantse and the spectacular medieval monastery at Sakya.
Off the beaten track alternative:�Complete a rugged three-day trek around Asia's most sacred peak, Mt Kailash, in remote Western Tibet, and then visit the incredible Kashmiri-influenced art of Tsaparang and the Guge Kingdom, hidden deep in the weirdly eroded desert gorges of the Sutlej Valley. Paved roads and an�airport outside Ali make the two-week trip much less arduous than it used to be, though you still have to hire transport and a guide through an agency in Lhasa or Kathmandu.

Nepal � a trekker's paradise
The best way to experience the mountains is on foot, and Himalayan treks just don't get any more spectacular or convenient than in Nepal. Follow mountain paths past lines of spinning prayer wheels and charming stone Sherpa or Tamang villages to the foot of jaw-dropping 8000m peaks like Annapurna or Everest, safe in the knowledge that at the end of the day you�re guaranteed a cozy bed and hot dinner. Add on a visit to the medieval cities of the Kathmandu Valley, once a Himalayan artistic powerhouse.
When to go: March, April, October, November.
Getting there: Fly to Kathmandu and hop on a domestic flight to Lukla for the Everest region. Pokhara is the launch pad for treks in the Annapurna region.
Suggested itinerary: To trek to Everest Base Camp you need a minimum of 14 days, but we recommend adding on a four day side visit to the stunning mountain lakes of the Gokyo valley. Factor in ample time to acclimatize.
Off the beaten track alternative: The 17-day walk around Manaslu is possibly Nepal's greatest�teahouse trek (you stay in lodges along the way), or go camping expedition-style on an epic three-week trip to the Dolpo or Kanchenjunga regions.

Traditional dress is the norm everywhere, old-growth forest carpets the majority�of the countryside and remote Himalayan peoples like the Layaps and Brokpas live a life largely untouched by the modern age. Simply put, Bhutan is like nowhere on earth. The catch? The fixed minimum daily rate of US$250 per person is mandatory, although this does include transport, meals, guide and accommodation.
When to go: March, April, September, October.
Getting there: Fly to Paro from Delhi or Bangkok, or drive overland from neighboring India.
Suggested itinerary: Explore the delightful Paro Valley and its iconic Tiger's Nest Hermitage�(Taktshang Goemba) before driving to the little-visited Haa Valley, the tiny capital of Thimphu and the sensual fortress-monastery of Punakha. Schedule your visit around one of Bhutan's colorful tsechus (monastic festivals).

But what is it really like seeking out incredible experiences to document in far flung corners of the globe? What are the challenges that come with the excitement? In celebration of the launch of Lonely Planet�s brand new book The Perfect Shot, an inspirational pictorial that showcases the best of Lonely Planet photography, we caught up with photographer Philip Lee Harvey to find out what his most memorable images are, and what advice he has to share with budding enthusiasts.
Having worked for Lonely Planet Magazine across a host of different locations, Philip found that the mix of traveling to new locations for work and being able to express himself creatively was indeed a dream come true. The other side to it of course is hard work, long hours, demanding deadlines and having to be ready to quickly pivot to unexpected situations that come your way.
Stupas at the top of Borobudur, Indonesia � Philip Lee Harvey / Lonely Planet
�I love travel and adventure, so combined with my obsessive interest in photography, it is a perfect fit. That said, there is a lot of sitting around waiting at airports, worrying about the weather and hoping that all of the logistics fall into place. If it can go wrong, it probably will. You have to learn to adapt quickly to unforeseen problems. Evenings are spent making sure that all data is downloaded and backed up. I have stayed in some amazing hotels with fantastic pools, but cannot recall ever going for a swim!� Philip told Lonely Planet.
Being on assignment has its benefits of course, and Philip said that one of the best things about it as a photographer and a travel-lover is gaining access to places that are often well off the usual tourist routes. The other side of it is that due to time pressures, there is rarely the time to relax and takes things in. �You never get the chance to just sit and watch. Everything is in a rush and you are always looking at life through a lens�.
Tigress swimming through a watering hole in Tadoba National Park � Philip Lee Harvey / Lonely Planet
Two of Philip�s most memorable photos are included in The Perfect Shot. The first is the image of a girl going past Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, Morocco. �The beauty of this place is how inclusive it is. Locals and visitors alike gather here to worship, meet and play. Favorite images change all the time, and I think that�s only natural. During lockdown I find myself thinking a lot about being on assignment and remembering those chance encounters. My image of a tigress swimming in Tadoba National Park in India was so very nearly missed. It was taken in the last hour of the last day illustrating a story about�Rudyard Kipling's�The Jungle Book. The sun was nearly gone, as was the hope that the shot would be captured. Then a few minutes later I saw the grass move next to us. I instinctively turned, camera in hand, and there was a tigress walking towards us. I grabbed some shots and then she was gone. But I heard the sound of her going into water, so we very quickly repositioned and I managed to see her swimming for a few seconds before the reeds obliterated the scene. It's for these magical moments that I travel.�

Philip's�favorite locations to take pictures is always somewhere that he has never been before. When it comes to giving advice to the average person hoping to up their own travel photography game, Philip said that some of the simple, obvious steps are the most important. �Make the effort to get up early and stay out late. The best light is always sunrise and sunset. Also, try to be original. The world is so full of images now that you must push your creativity if you really want to stand out. Finally, learn from others. Study the work of great image makers including painters and film makers, there are reasons why they are well-known and respected.�

At the moment, the work of a travel photographer has been completely upended, but Philip is currently planning his next trips for the future. �I have a list of assignments that I am waiting to shoot, so wherever opens up first and is safe to travel, I will be going there.�

Travel,163,How artificial intelligence is helping these companies protect the world's wildlife,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/ai-technology-preserves-wildlife,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2020-09/500pxRF_79299319.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,30-09-20,Companies committed to the conservation of wildlife are utilizing AI to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a growing number of sustainable programs�,How artificial intelligence is helping these companies protect the world's wildlife,"Achieving ethical travel goals has become a pressing ambition for many of us who wish to protect our vulnerable environment while still exploring the world. We are now acutely aware of how our carbon footprint stamps the earth, and how our daily recycling and commute behaviors can contribute towards the bigger green picture.

Tourism has been partly blamed for lending to the endangered status of many of the word�s beautiful wildlife, but there is a counter argument for finding responsible excursions and projects to take part in that may actually help minimize the damage being done. �
While the future of many living organisms is at risk if the activities of humans continue to place the same demands on the earth, these ethical travel projects actually help drive awareness among policy makers � and tourists in general � as to the extent of the difficulties many species face.
Aside from the economic motivation incentivizing those on a political level in those visited areas to ""do something,"" this education also encourages us as travelers to ""do more"" when we return to our own homes. Knowledge, as they say, is power.�
The technology 
Spiraling in a negative trajectory, the loss of wildlife species is currently estimated to be at least 1000 times higher than natural extinction rates. In better news, artificial intelligence (AI), and the continuous advances in technology, are allowing governments, organizations, and individuals to work toward a cleaner planet; on land, across air and in water.
Machine learning, data mining, smart sensors, image-recognition algorithms, remotely piloted aircraft and smart measurement devices; these are just some of developing tools that can be used to combat one of the greatest challenges facing our world today: sustainability.
And companies committed to the conservation of wildlife have been utilizing these tools, and more, as they strive to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a growing number of programs and projects. �
These innovations in wildlife protection have been created to battle against the pressures from unsustainable human activities that contribute to over-exploitation, climate change and habitat loss.�
Many of the world's coral reefs have been struck by bleaching due to climate change � Federica Grassi / Getty Images
The figures 
According to a landmark report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), worked on by more than 100 scientists from 36 countries, future damage from the rising seas and melting glaciers that cover 80%�of the earth is inevitable.
For some perspective on this, close to 6.6 billion tons of seafood has been taken from our oceans since 1950 and nearly 200 million people depend on coral reefs for protection against storm surge and waves (WWF figures).
However, the ""Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate"" allows for a glimmer of hope that the world still has time to stem the damage being done to corals and other marine life � if they act now.
This follows the most recent Living Planet report, published by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) every two years, which has shown population sizes of wildlife have decreased by 68%�globally between 1970 and 2016.
WWF President and CEO Carter Roberts has previously told Forbes that the report tracks a representative set of animals and the demands humanity places on the planet � and both of these trajectories continue to head in the wrong direction.
�We are losing species, in some cases at an accelerated rate, and humanity demands 1.5 times what the planet can sustain,"" Roberts says. ""That can�t last.�
Nonprofits like Snow Leopard Trust are using AI technology to protect endangered species � Dennis W Donohue / Shutterstock
The action 
The ability to measure, track and assist in protecting and prolonging life in a species of wildlife is becoming more and more accessible and effective as companies � and scientists � leverage the technology at hand.
Seattle-based Snow Leopard Trust is a nonprofit group that works to protect the endangered cat on the ground in China, Kyrgyzstan, India, Mongolia and Pakistan. It does this by gaining a better understanding of the animals� needs and behaviors, its surroundings and threats.
Partnering with Microsoft, the organization is using an AI solution to improve the data collection from their remote cameras, helping to identify snow leopards from other animals that may have triggered the camera sensors and classifying hundreds of thousands of photos in mere minutes.
Another method being used for tracking behaviors such as the sleeping and travel patterns of species of wild land animals are smart collars. While traditional collars have come under some controversy for the data that could potentially be accessible by hunters, groups such as Kenya-based nonprofit Save the Elephants believe that the collars actually help to outsmart would-be poachers.
The real-time feed from these devices � which detect panicked motions as if the animal were under attack, or inform if the animal enters an area hunters are known to frequent � allow rangers to react and steer the elephant away from danger, and potentially lead to arrests of poachers.
Scaling up or down � and thinking outside the box � when interacting with such a wide range of wildlife at risk is essential. But whether it�s a teeny tiny backpack that weighs 5%�of the weight of a resilient piping plover, or gene sequencing to solve the Tasmanian devil�s facial cancer crisis; AI and technological advances are making these things possible.
One exceptional ongoing project is that of the New Zealand Department of Conservation�s Kakapo Recovery Program. The official �spokesbird� for New Zealand conservation, the kakapo is veering very closely to extinction and scientists are using fitness trackers and semen-carrying drones to help the bird reproduce.
There are only 142 living adult kakapo birds in New Zealand � Robin Bush / Getty Images
When it comes to our ocean life, we explore yet another realm of innovation. OceanMind, for example, helps to inform and empower authorities and seafood buyers on fishing compliance around the globe. From cutting-edge technology for �dark vessel� detection and real-time alert feeds to supply chain transparency and surveillance of marine protected areas, the non profit�s mission statement after a relaunch last year is clear: protect the world�s fisheries.
Taking a rather different approach in caring for the water wildlife is the Zoological Society of London�s Karina Acevedo-Whitehouse. The scientist is behind a non-invasive method of collecting samples from whales to assess health: by recovering the mammals� snot from outside of the blowhole.
The technique involves using a 3.5ft remote-controlled helicopter with petri dishes attached below to be positioned in the ""mist"" of a blow arising from the ocean�s surface. Analyzing the mucus can then determine if there is anomalous bacteria present.
The future of AI and conservation
As the world becomes increasingly aware of humanity's impact on the environment and ecosystems, technology will play an increasing role in stemming the loss of wildlife.
The groups above are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the AI-related activity being done to counteract the potential extent of destruction. The power of the technology that many feared would lead to the loss of their job could save the planet.

Travel,164,How and where to celebrate Holi in India,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/guide-to-holi-festival-india,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/image_browser/Holi_colour_celebrations_India_S.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,06-02-20,"With bonfires, tasty treats and coloured powder galore, Holi is one of India�s most spectacular festivals. Here�s how and where to celebrate Holi in India.",How and where to celebrate Holi in India,"What is it with India and colour? From deity-filled temples to rainbow-hued saris, India�s colours are vivid and supersaturated. But the palette goes into overdrive once a year for the festival of Holi�in the Hindu lunar month of Phalguna � falling on�9-10 March in 2020 � when most of the country is drenched in coloured powder.

For those brave enough to venture into the streets when the gulal (powder) starts flying, Holi represents one of the world�s most immersive � and striking � travel experiences, a chance to dive into India�s captivating Hindu culture and feel, first hand, the fascinating sense of belief that makes this country tick.

What is Holi?
For Hindus, Holi marks the ultimate battle between good and evil, when the demoness Holika tried to murder her devout nephew, Prahlada, in a funeral pyre. Through the power of devotion, Prahlada was saved from the flames, but Vishnu ensured that Holika came to a fiery end. The first night of the Holi celebrations is marked by ceremonial fires, commemorating the legend.
Vishnu also took on Holika�s evil brother, Hiranyakashipu, who�d been granted special protection by Brahma. As Hiranyakashipu could not be killed by man or beast, indoors or outside, by day or night using any weapon, Vishnu assumed the form of Narasimha � half man, half lion � and disembowelled the demon, at dusk, on the threshold of his house, with his bare hands, neatly sidestepping all these caveats.
For all the blood and guts, the legend is there as an allegory for how easily human beings succumb to vanity and greed, and the challenges and rewards of maintaining faith. You�ll see carvings of the disembowelling of Hiranyakashipu all over India as a reminder to the faithful.

How do you celebrate Holi?
Nobody escapes when Holi comes around. Anyone who ventures into the streets gets doused with water and coloured powder, as the country turns yellow, blue, red, green, pink and purple. For visitors, it can all look a little like a playground paint fight, but there�s a strong spiritual element to this technicolour free for all.
Each of the colours tossed around has a powerful symbolism for Hindus. Blue represents the skin of Krishna, water, and spiritual growth. Green is the colour of virility, symbolising new life, and the forests where Rama spent his time in exile. Red is the colour of love, passion and fertility, hinting at the sindoor mark worn by married women. Yellow signifies the sun, and the robes of Vishnu. Pink represents compassion; purple hints at the mystery of the divine.
According to legend, the ritual of throwing coloured powder was kicked off by Krishna, the mischievous incarnation of Vishnu, in the meadows of Vrindavan near Agra. But today the activity is undertaken all over India, with dhol drummers providing a pulsing soundtrack that adds to the carnival atmosphere.
Prepare for a makeover
The key rule of Holi is that you will get soaked in colours, whether you�re actively participating in the celebration or not� And Holi pigments can stain, even if locals insist they won�t. Many people buy some cheap clothing that they can write off after the festival; a kurta Punjabi (long cotton shirt for men) or a salwar kameez (shirt and trousers for women) is perfect for the occasion. Choose a white outfit and you�ll finish up looking like an abstract, modern art masterpiece.
Be warned that the synthetic chemicals used for Holi pigments can cause a skin reaction. If you have sensitive skin, seek out a high vantage point and watch the festivities from above, minimising the chances of a dousing. If you dive in, wear sunglasses to keep the colours out of your eyes, and don't carry any tech that will suffer if it gets damp (or keep it inside a ziplock bag).

Is Holi safe for women?
Indian women enthusiastically join in the Holi celebrations, but the festival, regrettably, has a reputation for sexual harassment, often passed off as innocent fun by male festival goers. Many revellers are emboldened by alcohol and bhang (cannabis), and wandering hands are common in crowds. Solo women travellers are likely to get more hassle than women travelling with a male companion.
Local women often avoid the general melee at street level to minimise the risk of unwanted physical contact, viewing the celebrations instead from a balcony or doorway. As well as having more control over your personal space, you�ll have a superior vantage point for taking photos, particularly if you have a long camera lens. Opting to celebrate Holi in smaller towns, rather than in the scrum of big city streets, can also minimise unwanted attention.

Holi�s festive treats
Festival time brings special dishes to the table. Wherever people gather look out for gujiya (flaky pastries stuffed with milk curds and dried fruit) and malpua (sweet pancakes served with spiced, reduced condensed milk). Savoury snacks such as dahi vada (lentil fritters in yoghurt) are also eaten with gusto.
Be wary, however, of bhang ladoos (sweets) and bhang thandai (spiced almond milk), both prepared with cannabis. The drug is semi-legal during religious celebrations, but strength is impossible to gauge, and travellers have been involved in accidents or worse while under the influence.

Where should I celebrate Holi?
Every part of India has its own take on the Holi celebrations. To get the best out of Holi, point your compass towards the following lavish festivities.
Mathura & VrindavanIndia�s most colourful Holi celebrations (and that�s saying something!) take place in the towns of Mathura and Vrindavan, where Lord Krishna spent his formative years cavorting with milkmaids. Vrindavan�s Banke Bihari Temple is the focal point for some of the most enthusiastic powder throwing in all of India.
Barsana & NandgaonIn the villages of Barsana and Nandgaon in Uttar Pradesh, Holi morphs into Lathmar Holi, starting two days before the main Holi celebrations. In this curious reinvention of the Holi tradition, women ceremonially 'beat' the menfolk of the village with wooden staves, before the usual colours fly.

Anandpur SahibThis holy town in the Punjab celebrates Holi alongside Hola Mahalla, a festival conceived at the height of the Mughal empire to raise morale amongst the oppressed Sikh people. This is a time for readings of Sikh poetry, mock battles and displays of prowess with sacred weapons, as well as the usual Holi shenanigans.
GoaGoa�s Catholic reputation is overstated; the state is 66% Hindu, and Holi � celebrated locally as Shigmo � is a highlight of the festival calendar. Rather than powder throwing, parades and dances in colourful costumes are the main attraction, though a fair amount of pigment gets tossed around as well.

ShantiniketanThis West Bengali cultural institution is the place to come for a more dignified Holi, as performers put on animated shows of music, dance and drama for Basant Utsav, a festival conceived by India�s national poet, Rabindranath Tagore. Here, coloured powder takes second place to iridescent costumes and make-up. Most years, the fair begins the day before Holi.
Delhi, Jaipur & MumbaiThese three big Indian cities are probably the best places to come to see the urban version of Holi, where normal life seizes to a halt and citizens embark on a city-wide play fight with water and coloured pigments. On one level, it�s carnage, but the atmosphere is unparalleled.�

Travel,165,Five unforgettable first-time experiences in India,https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/first-time-in-india-experiences,https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/image_browser/Holy_men_on_steps_India_S.jpg?auto=format&w=140&h=140&fit=crop&q=75,29-01-20,"From your first temple blessing to learning how to book train tickets, here�s our pick of the best firsts you can look forward to ahead of a trip to India.",Five unforgettable first-time experiences in India,"You never forget the first curry you eat with your hands; the momentary awkwardness, the sticky feel of sauce between your fingers, and, of course, the taste � somehow all the sweeter for your show of dexterity. But India is full of first experiences, each more unexpected, unfamiliar and wonderful than the last, which add together to make one of the most surprising, challenging and rewarding travel destinations on the planet.
Your first trip to India is certain to open your eyes to a whole host of new experiences�� chris piason / Shutterstock
Discovering India is not something that happens all at once, on a single trip. This is a country the size of a continent, and understanding India�s customs and quirks is a lifelong quest. Nevertheless, it�s those first experiences � your first train ride, your first banana-leaf thali, your first temple blessing � that will stay with you for a lifetime.�
Here�s our pick of the best �firsts� you can look forward to ahead of a trip to India, all of which mark the transition from merely visiting to becoming, subconsciously, part of the subcontinent.�
Eating with your hands feels weird to the unaccustomed, but soon you'll become a pro�� Emanuele Siracusa / Getty Images
Your first meal on a banana leaf
Plates and cutlery are so last year. In the Indian south, meals are dished out on a freshly wiped banana leaf, and eaten with the fingers, without the aid of a spoon, fork or knife. Learning the Indian way of eating is a skill that every traveller to India should acquire; indeed, when you leave the tourist trail, cutlery is a rare novelty. But once you get over the initial squeamishness about getting hands-on with your food, you�ll soon be wolfing down curries like a local.�
The trick to eating rice and runny sauces with your fingers is to clump the rice and sauce into balls, sliding them off a ramp created with your fingers into your mouth. Remember to do this one handed � in India, the left hard is reserved for personal ablutions. Only eat with your right hand, and carry a bottle of anti-bacterial gel to avoid skin-carried bugs.�
The best banana leaf thalis are served in steamy South Indian cities such as Mysuru (Mysore), Madurai, Chennai and Bengaluru. Alongside bottomless servings of rice and roti (chapatis), your banana leaf will be topped with assorted curries � usually vegetarian, though some places offer a choice of veg and non-veg dishes � and sides such as curd, dhal (stewed lentils), pickles and even desserts. It�s a South Indian feast, with no environmentally-unfriendly washing up to worry about at the end.�
Shows of faith are on display everywhere you look in India � niladrilovesphotography / Shutterstock
�Your first temple blessing
Faith is far from a private matter in India. Blessings, invocations and rituals all take place in full public view � at temples, shrines, along the banks of sacred rivers, in homes, and even out in the street � and visitors are routinely invited, nay railroaded, into proceedings. Your first blessing at a Hindu temple can feel a bit like a drive-by baptism, but it�s an indelible part of the Indian experience.�
Most likely, you�ll first be offered a blessing when entering a temple courtyard, or wandering along sacred ghats (ritual steps), by a white-robed priest wearing a sacred Brahmin thread. You may be whisked to the inner sanctum, and invited to sprinkle blessed water or waft sacred fire, with a whirlwind explanation of the temple deities and their wish-granting powers.�
Almost every temple blessing finishes with a chanted prayer and a daub of colourful kunkum powder on the forehead, representing the third eye and devotion to a specific sect of Hinduism (though you don�t need to hold Hindu beliefs to participate in this distinctively Indian ritual). You�ll also be asked to make a donation � locals invariably do, so you�re not being singled out � and offered prasaad, ritual food blessed by the gods. �
Booking trains in India can be a real slog, but it's always worth it � Tuul & Bruno Morandi / Getty Images
Your first train booking
Train rides anywhere have a little sprinkling of magic, but in India, the fairy dust is heaped on in spades. From the moment you set foot on the platform, you�ll be plunged headlong into the irresistible intensity of the country. Hawkers hawk, porters push, waiting passengers eat tiffin-pot meals or snooze under shawl blankets, and chai-wallahs (tea sellers) fill the platforms with a high-speed, song-like chant of ""ek chai, ek chai, ek chai"".��
Just the act of booking your first train ticket will fill you with elation at having mastered one of the most fascinating, furious examples of bureaucracy on the planet. To book your train, you need to know the train number, the abbreviations for the exact train stations, the seat classes, and which of the dozens of ticket windows to queue at. You also need at least a working understanding of the system of wait-listing and quotas in case your chosen train is booked solid.�
It�s possible (if complicated) to book online, and somewhat easier if you visit the special foreign quota desk at major stations such as Mumbai�s CST and New Delhi railway station (the International Tourist Bureau is located upstairs), but the sense of accomplishment that comes from booking your first ticket in the chaotic surroundings of the general ticket hall will linger long after the train has dropped you at your destination. This is one of the great gauntlets to run before you can say you have truly arrived in India. For more tips, check our guide to booking trains in India.�
Once you�ve secured your ticket, prepare yourself for the next wonderful India first � rattling through the countryside with a cup of chai in hand.�
Some Indian grooming salons are more modern than others � NARINDER NANU / Getty Images
Your first Indian shave
For male travellers, going for a shave in India is a step back to the golden age of male grooming. Entering an Indian barber�s shop is the first step in a flamboyant piece of public theatre, that begins with the almost ritualistic snapping of a fresh razor blade and ends with a vigorous head massage.��
Part of the fun of a traditional shave with a cutthroat razor is surrendering to the process. A shave is an act of grooming;�an art�performed by the skilled person on the other end of the blade, and should be allowed to unfold in its own time. Having committed to the process, you put yourself entirely in the hands of the person delicately sliding a sword-sharp blade just millimetres from your jugular; mental images of Sweeney Todd add a definite frisson to proceedings.�
To start, you�ll be lathered with foamy soap, applied with a hog�s hair brush, before your skin is pulled taut in every possible direction to ensure that not a single hair escapes the whispering blade. With the undergrowth cleared, you�ll be rubbed with potassium alum, a natural astringent that tightens the skin and sterilises any microscopic nicks and scratches, before a pampering rub with moisturiser and aftershave.�
The coup de gr�ce is the�head massage to finish, a vigorous pummelling and drumming of the fingers that ends with sudden, unexpected twists of the neck and slaps on the forehead with hands grasped together, as if in prayer. It might sound a little like being the loser in a pehlwani (Indian wrestling) match,�but actually�the process is thoroughly invigorating.��
The Guru-ka-Langar of the Golden Temple in Amritsar feeds a staggering 100,000 pilgrims per day�� Matt Munro / Lonely Planet
Your first visit to a gurdwara
The Sikh religion has a legendary reputation for hospitality, and a visit to a gurdwara (literally, the �door to the guru�) is a humbling reminder of the common humanity that binds people together, regardless of colour or creed. Topped by ribbed, lotus-like domes, gurdwaras reverberate to the hypnotic chanting of passages from the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book, and ceremonial weapons are prominently displayed inside, a reminder that Sikhism is a martial order, as well as a singularly welcoming philosophy.�
Nowhere is this welcome more apparent than when visiting a langar, the communal gurdwara kitchen and dining hall, where free meals are provided to all comers (a donation is appropriate).�
At major shrines such as the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the experience is like being a spontaneous guest at a vast Indian banquet. And we mean vast � the Golden Temple�s Guru-ka-Langar feeds a staggering 100,000 pilgrims per day. Meals are simple but nourishing � chapatis, curries and rice � eaten cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by people from every walk of life. It�s a testament to India�s remarkable power to bring people together.

It represents opportunity, change, and the chance to immerse yourself in something completely unique and to grow as a person. With that in mind, Lonely Planet has released a new book - Travel Goals: Inspiring Experiences to Transform Your Life - which outlines distinctive activities in diverse locations all over the globe that are sure to encourage you to start thinking about your next big adventure! Including practicable ways to achieve the goals, it�s the perfect travel-planning companion.
Adventure-lovers can put together a new list of goals and activities � Noel Hendrickson
Embracing new adventures
Whether it�s hunting for truffles in the Italian woods, riding the 140-year-old Darjeeling Railway in India, gazing at the twinkling night skies in the Gobi Desert or learning how to build boats in Maine, USA, the new book is all about transformative travel experiences that will stay with you long after you�ve returned home. Laid out like a feel-good travel bucket list, every goal is accompanied by recommendations stating where you can try it, along with information and websites that will help make it a reality. Travellers are amazingly diverse in their interests and goals, and in turn each destination offers something special that will resonate with people.
When it comes to adventuring in the great outdoors, readers can find information on various activities such as summiting a mountain, with a half-day (optional) barefoot pilgrimage up Ireland�s Croagh Patrick, a steamy ascent of the fiery Volc�n Concepci�n in Nicaragua and a multi-day guided climb of Mount Kinabalu in Malaysian Borneo all being outlined. There�s also details on how to get off the tourist trail to see lesser-seen places like the city of Ku�lap in Northern Peru (extremely captivating while being less crowded than Machu Picchu), Slovenia�s Mount Triglav and Lake Bled, and the rugged Tien Shan mountain range in Kyrgyzstan.�
Travel Goals helps readers discover diverse activities and experiences all over the world � James Gabriel Martin
Challenging how we travel
The aim of Travel Goals is not only to shine a light on the 'where'�of travel, but also the 'how' and 'why'. It�s all too easy to get into the habit of going for the obvious choices when it comes to taking a trip, or simply searching for budget-friendly flights and accommodation, when in reality, thinking a bit outside the box may lead to you ending up with more interesting stories and longer-lasting memories. Topics such as how to be a tourist in your own country are covered, with tips on how you can take a road trip across the United States in a vintage car and how to go on a domestic safari in wilds of Scotland. By viewing travel from another angle, you can see the world in a different way. The book also covers how to travel without a goal (whether its island hoping in Greece or wandering around the streets of Amsterdam) and going off grid, leaving your phone at home and disconnecting from the digital world.
Find your tribe in any city and learn from the friendly locals � franckreporter
Connecting with yourself and others
From having a fling while on holiday and embracing your sexuality to learning from the kindness of strangers, buying rounds for locals, or finding your tribe in a foreign city, Travel Goals hones in on some of the rewarding ways travel can touch you on a personal level. The chapter on being yourself � something that often sounds easier in theory � outlines writer Clover Stroud�s experiences in North Ossetia in the hulking Caucasus Mountains of remote southern Russia, and how immersing herself in the challenge helped her regain a sense of identity and individualism. Readers can also find suggestions on overseas volunteering with organisations such as Raleigh International, a UK charity that works to protect and supply resources in places like Costa Rica, Nepal and Tanzania, Peace Corps, who arrange 27-month placements in 60 different countries and Global Citizen Year (GCY), which recruits and trains young people for a gap-year �fellowship� between high school and college.
Learn how to become an ocean defender and have a positive impact on the world while travelling � Klaus Vedfelt
Change the world�
Thankfully, today, more and more travellers are taking eco-friendly steps with their habits, and opting for sustainable trips that can have a positive impact on the world, and having a resource that further explores this idea means that more people are likely to try it out. Travel Goals contains a how-to on becoming an ocean defender, from dining consciously on sustainably harvested seafood and choosing eco-certified tour operators to working with sea-friendly organisations such as 5Gyres, Surfrider and Waterkeeper Alliance. If that kickstarts your passion, you can also learn more about joining conservation projects that plant trees that contribute to forests in North America, Latin America, Asia and Africa, and become a volunteer citizen scientist to help gather important data for ongoing research. There�s also information on paying it forward that includes details on how to help struggling communities and animals, whether it�s big undertakings like volunteering in a refugee camp or smaller acts like packing for a purpose with extra colouring pencils, bandages and surgical gloves for places that need it.�

The World Meteorological Organization described the hot weather as a global phenomenon: record high temperatures were recorded in 2023. January 2024 has been recorded as the hottest month on record so far worldwide. Gilbert Ouma, the coordinator of the University of Nairobi's Institute for Climate Change and Adaptation, and an associate professor at the Department of Meteorology, answers some key questions.	      What is unusual about the weather in Nairobi?
The annual average temperatures for Nairobi are normally moderate, between 24�C and 25�C on the higher side and 17�C-18�C on the lower side. These are generally very comfortable temperatures. However, in the December-January-February period, maximum temperatures are normally high, ranging between 26�C and 27�C.
This year, temperatures in February went up to between 29�C and 30�C, even hitting 31�C. This is about 6�C higher than normal Nairobi temperatures. That is a big difference and our bodies are bound to feel the difference. If such an increase is sustained for a long time, it can lead to a heat wave.
But in Nairobi's case, the high temperatures have been on and off, so we can't really talk of a heat wave. What Nairobi has had is a wave of hot weather that the human body can easily adjust to.
Why is the weather suddenly hot?
The winds that pass over Kenya from December to February every year are from the north. They blow mainly through continental areas, including some deserts. These winds flow in waves and periodically bring hot weather, the kind that has prevailed recently across east Africa.
The temperatures that are prevailing in Kenya are also dictated by the path that the winds take from the north. If the path is straight (over land mass), then we end up with these high temperatures that we have experienced in the early months of 2024. If the winds follow a path that curves into the Indian Ocean, then the temperatures get moderated, resulting in cooler weather and rainfall in Kenya and other parts of east Africa.

																																						
    
     



																																			Also, because of climate change, average global temperatures are rising. The temperatures last year were the highest on record. So the relatively high temperatures that we normally experience during this season (December-January-February) may be considerably higher.
Another thing to note is that the December to February season is always a dry season in Kenya, but December and January of 2024 were wet because of the late el Ni�o rains. The el Ni�o phenomenon is normally experienced in this region within the September-October-November season. The temperatures which were supposed to be high in December and January were therefore moderated by those rains. So, when the rains ceased, the usual heat suddenly set in, making February feel very hot.
Kenya and its eastern African neighbors have all experienced the hot weather. The region is now moving towards the March-April-May season when the rainfall belt comes back around the equator and the sun will be overhead. The rainfall is expected to moderate the high temperatures.
What's the effect of rising temperatures?
Aside from the hot weather at this time of year, the global climate is changing and average global temperatures are rising. The annual temperature for Africa has been increasing at an average rate of 0.13�C per decade since 1910, but this has more than doubled to 0.28�C since 1981. The normal minimum temperatures and the maximum temperatures are rising. This will lead to changes in extremes, such as storms. A storm is a way that the atmosphere discharges excess energy to regain equilibrium. When the energy builds in the atmosphere up to over certain levels, the excess has to go somewhere. The excess energy build-up due to the greenhouse gas effect, which leads to climate change, requires dissipation. This is usually achieved through intense storms, leading to more frequent extreme rainfall events. On the other hand, the other extreme of very low rainfall will also occur, and so we will get more droughts. The total amount of rains will go up in some places and down in others.
There will also be an impact on ecosystems. A number of species will not survive the changing climate. For instance, mosquitoes cannot thrive in temperatures below 17�C and above 35�C. So when the average temperatures of places go beyond this range, mosquitoes would find it difficult to survive. However, the temperatures of some places whose temperatures were not within this range may change and get within it. For such places, malaria will become a problem when previously there was no malaria there.
The long term effect would be bad on people's health. It could lead to heat stroke and chronic conditions such kidney disease, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. It could also cause respiratory problems such as asthma.

Sea ice levels in Antarctica have registered historic lows for three consecutive years, portending grave consequences for life on Earth as we know it.But looking out over the southernmost continent, scientist Miguel Angel de Pablo laments that humanity seems to be oblivious to the warnings.
""We (scientists) are very worried... because we don't see how we can solve it ourselves,"" the Spanish planetary geologist told AFP on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Antarctic archipelago.
""The more alerts we send out... to make society aware of what is happening, it seems we are not listened to, that we are (perceived as) alarmist"" despite the evidence, he said.
The US National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) reported Wednesday that minimum Antarctic sea ice extent came in at under two million square kilometers (772,000 square miles) for a third consecutive February�the height of the southern summer thaw season.
Minimum sea ice cover for all three years were the lowest since records began 46 years ago.
Melting sea ice has no immediate impact on ocean levels, as it forms by freezing salt water already in the ocean.
But the white ice reflects more of the sun's rays than darker ocean water, and its loss accentuates global warming while exposing the on-land freshwater ice sheet, which could cause a catastrophic sea level rise if it melts.
""Even though we are far from any inhabited part of the planet, in reality what happens in Antarctica affects everything"" in the rest of the world, said De Pablo.

'Not easily undone'
A study last year found that nearly half of Antarctica's ice shelves�floating sheets attached to the landmass�have also reduced in volume in the past 25 years, releasing trillions of tons of meltwater into the oceans.

																																						
    
     



																																			This has implications not only for sea levels but also for ocean salinity and temperature, said De Pablo.
Some scientists say evidence for climate change impact on sea ice melt in Antarctica�known for significant annual variations in its summer thaws and winter freezes�is less clear than in the Arctic north pole.
What is not in doubt is that continued global warming caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases will affect these patterns in future.
De Pablo, who has devoted 16 years of his life to studying Antarctic ice, told AFP it may already be too late to stop the trend.
""The problem is that these degradations are not easily undone,"" he said.
""Even if today we (changed) the rhythms of life that we have in Western societies, tomorrow the glaciers would not cease to degrade nor the frozen soils to be lost,"" with all that entails.
Scientists estimate global temperatures are already 1.2 degrees Celsius hotter overall than pre-industrial levels. The 2015 Paris Agreement had set out to limit warming to 1.5 C (2.7 Fahrenheit) by curbing planet-warming emissions.
""We have to ask ourselves whether the manner in which we live our daily lives is truly worth it because in the end we will lose our planet,"" said De Pablo.
""There is no second planet"" Earth, he added.

The same weather system that led to the spread of the devastating Labor Day wildfires in 2020 brought record-breaking cold and early-season snowfall to parts of the Rocky Mountains. Now, new research from Portland State is shedding light on the meteorology behind what happened and the impacts of such an extreme weather event.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	""It's really interesting to see such an amplified pattern result in opposing extremes in the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains,"" said Emma Russell, a master's student in geography and lead author of the study published in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes.
A high-pressure ridge was responsible for the extremely warm temperatures leading up to the event. Russell said the primary atmospheric driver was a highly amplified wave pattern�the strongest on record for that time of year�that persisted for several days. The wave broke, much like an ocean wave breaks, bringing about a strong wind event over western Oregon.
""Even for winter, that would have been a very strong wind event, but for early September, there's nothing in the observational record quite that strong,"" said Paul Loikith, an associate professor of geography and director of PSU's Climate Science Lab.
The warm temperatures coupled with the strong and dry easterly winds fueled several large wildfires, which ultimately led to the evacuation of over 40,000 people, the destruction of 5,000 homes and businesses and the loss of nine lives in Oregon. The widespread wildfire smoke then led to abnormally high levels of air pollution across the region for the following two weeks. An analysis of air parcel backward trajectories found that the dry air over the Pacific Northwest, which exacerbated the fire danger, originated in western Canada at heights over 5,000 meters.

																																						
    
     



																																			""The air is very dry at these high altitudes and as it descends to the surface, it begins to warm which increases the dryness,"" Russell said. ""That helps explain where the dry air was coming from.""
That same weather system brought record-setting cold temperatures for the time of year to parts of the Rocky Mountains, the Southwest and the Great Plains, just days after record-setting warmth.
""South of the jet stream is where the air is warmer and north is colder,"" Loikith said. ""When the peak of the wave is over a region, that's where you get warm air surging north, and where you have the trough of the wave is where you have cold air surging south. Both were going on adjacent to one another.""
Russell said the event was a confluence of record-breaking intense patterns�and while it's not outside the realm of possibility that it can happen again, it's not evident that events like these are becoming more common. One thing we know for sure is that everything's getting warmer.
""If a similar event does happen again, the warm side will be warmer and the cold side will be less cold,"" Loikith said. ""We can just assume that it's always going to be a little bit warmer than it otherwise would have been. The temperature factor is always there.""
The study's co-authors are Idowu Ajibade, a former PSU professor now at Emory University; James Done from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR); and Chris Lower, a master's student in geography at PSU.

After one of the most intense cyclones in world history tore through the Pacific island of Tanna in Vanuatu, new research led by the University of Hawai?i at M?noa showed the resilience of the island's forests.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	In the Pacific islands, climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of cyclones, causing huge potential risks to forests and the people who depend on them. In March 2015, Cyclone Pam touched down on the island of Tanna as the strongest Pacific island cyclone in history at the time. With sustained winds reaching 165 mph, Pam pounded the island for 18 hours.
A new study published on February 29 in the journal Science of the Total Environment has documented the remarkable recovery of Tanna's forests after Cyclone Pam. The team, which included researchers from UH M?noa, The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG), the University of the South Pacific, and the Vanuatu Cultural Center and Vanuatu Department of Forestry, examined post-cyclone recovery across eight forested sites on Tanna over five years.
""Compared to cyclones on other Pacific Islands, Pam caused relatively low levels of severe damage to Tanna's trees,"" said UH M?noa School of Life Sciences Professor Tamara Ticktin and lead author on the paper. ""In addition, there was high resprouting, widespread recruitment of most tree species present, and basically no spread of invasive species.""
The latter is especially surprising, because invasive species often spread rapidly after Pacific Island cyclones.

Cyclone history, stewardship practice, key to resilience
The authors conclude that Tanna's historical cyclone frequency likely fostered the abundance of resilient species, and that Tanna's customary stewardship practices appear to augment the capacity for resilience. This is because they promote a diversity of tree species, life histories and life stages; as well as a wide range of pathways for regeneration.

																																						
    
     



																																			""Tanna stewards value a wide range of species useful for food, medicines and building materials,"" explained ethnobotanist and co-author Michael J. Balick, Ph.D., NYBG's Vice President for Botanical Science and Director and Senior Philecology Curator of the Institute for Economic Botany. ""And customary stewardship involves management practices that enhance the survival and reproduction of these species.""
Co-author Jean-Pascal Wahe of the Vanuatu Cultural Center noted that after a cyclone, stewards weed around native tree species and even plant them.
These actions can help ensure their regeneration while decreasing dominance of weedy understory species.

The study also showed that forests that had previously been subject to grazing by cattle and pigs were slower to recover and will likely be more vulnerable to future cyclones.
""This highlights the key role of forest management in building resilience to climate change,"" said senior author Gregory M. Plunkett, Ph.D., NYBG's Director and Curator of the Cullman Program for Molecular Systematics. Dr. Plunkett, who has been studying the plants of Vanuatu for two decades, had been carrying out research on Tanna along with Dr. Balick and co-author Marika Tuiwawa of the University of the South Pacific when Cyclone Pam hit. They experienced the terror of the cyclone first-hand and were delighted to also witness forest recovery.
""As the world comes to grips with more frequent extreme weather events, our work suggests that the right kind of human interaction can play a significant role in the survival of forests,"" said Dr. Plunkett.
This study is part of the wider Plants and People of Vanuatu program, led by Drs. Balick and Plunkett, and was supported by the National Science Foundation, the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, and the National Geographic Society.

The United Nations Environment Assembly this week considered a resolution on solar radiation modification, which refers to controversial technologies intended to mask the heating effect of greenhouse gases by reflecting some sunlight back to space.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	Proponents argue the technologies will limit the effects of climate change. In reality, this type of ""geoengineering"" risks further destabilizing an already deeply disturbed climate system. What's more, its full impacts cannot be known until after deployment.
The draft resolution initially called for the convening of an expert group to examine the benefits and risks of solar radiation modification. The motion was withdrawn after no consensus could be reached on the controversial topic.
A notable development was a call from some Global South countries for a ""non-use agreement"" on solar radiation modification. We strongly support this position. Human-caused climate change is already one planetary-scale experiment too many�we don't need another.

																																						
    
     



																																			A risky business
In some circles, solar geoengineering is gaining prominence as a response to the climate crisis. However, research has consistently identified potential risks posed by the technologies such as:

unpredictable effects on climate and weather patterns
biodiversity loss, especially if use of the technology was halted abruptly
undermining food security by, for example, reducing light and increasing salinity on land
the infringement of human rights across generations�including, but not limited to, passing on huge risks to generations that will come after us.

Here, we discuss several examples of solar radiation modification which exemplify the threats posed by these technologies. These are also depicted in the graphic below.
A load of hot air
In April 2022, an American startup company released two weather balloons into the air from Mexico. The experiment was conducted without approval from Mexican authorities.
The intent was to cool the atmosphere by deflecting sunlight. The resulting reduction in warming would be sold for profit as ""cooling credits"" to those wanting to offset greenhouse gas pollution.
Appreciably cooling the climate would, in reality, require injecting millions of metric tons of aerosols into the stratosphere, using a purpose-built fleet of high-altitude aircraft. Such an undertaking would alter global wind and rainfall patterns, leading to more drought and cyclones, exacerbating acid rainfall and slowing ozone recovery.
Once started, this stratospheric aerosol injection would need to be carried out continually for at least a century to achieve the desired cooling effect. Stopping prematurely would lead to an unprecedented rise in global temperatures far outpacing extreme climate change scenarios.

Another solar geoengineering technology, known as marine cloud brightening, seeks to make low-lying clouds more reflective by spraying microscopic seawater droplets into the air. Since 2017, trials have been underway on the Great Barrier Reef.
The project is tiny in scale, and involves pumping seawater onto a boat and spraying it from nozzles towards the sky. The project leader says the mist-generating machine would need to be scaled up by a factor of 10, to about 3,000 nozzles, to brighten nearby clouds by 30%.
After years of trials, the project has not yet produced peer-reviewed empirical evidence that cloud brightening could reduce sea surface temperatures or protect corals from bleaching.
The Great Barrier Reef is the size of Italy. Scaling up attempts at cloud brightening would require up to 1,000 machines on boats, all pumping and spraying vast amounts of seawater for months during summer. Even if it worked, the operation is hardly, as its proponents claim, ""environmentally benign"".
The technology's effects remain unclear. For the Great Barrier Reef, less sunlight and lower temperatures could alter water movement and mixing, harming marine life. Marine life may also be killed by pumps or negatively affected by the additional noise pollution. And on land, marine cloud brightening may lead to altered rainfall patterns and increased salinity, damaging agriculture.
More broadly, 101 governments last year agreed to a statement describing marine-based geoengineering, including cloud brightening, as having ""the potential for deleterious effects that are widespread, long-lasting or severe.""

																																						
    
     



																																			Balls, bubbles and foams
The Arctic Ice Project involves spreading a layer of tiny glass spheres over large regions of sea ice to brighten its surface and halt ice loss.
Trials have been conducted on frozen lakes in North America. Scientists recently showed the spheres actually absorb some sunlight, speeding up sea-ice loss in some conditions.
Another proposed intervention is spraying the ocean with microbubbles or sea foam to make the surface more reflective. This would introduce large concentrations of chemicals to stabilize bubbles or foam at the sea surface, posing significant risk to marine life, ecosystem function and fisheries.
No more distractions
Some scientists investigating solar geoengineering discuss the need for ""exit ramps""�the termination of research once a proposed intervention is deemed to be technically infeasible, too risky or socially unacceptable. We believe this point has already been reached.

																																			Since 2022, more than 500 scientists from 61 countries have signed an open letter calling for an international non-use agreement on solar geoengineering. Aside from the types of risks discussed above, the letter said the speculative technologies detract from the urgent need to cut global emissions, and that no global governance system exists to fairly and effectively regulate their deployment.
Calls for outdoor experimentation of the technologies are misguided and detract energy and resources from what we need to do today: phase out fossil fuels and accelerate a just transition worldwide.
Climate change is the greatest challenge facing humanity, and global responses have been woefully inadequate. Humanity must not pursue dangerous distractions that do nothing to tackle the root causes of climate change, come with incalculable risk, and will likely further delay climate action.

Glacier-fed streams are undergoing a process of profound change, according to EPFL and Charles University scientists in a paper appearing in Nature Geoscience today. This conclusion is based on the expeditions to the world's major mountain ranges by members of the Vanishing Glaciers project.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	Microbial life will flourish in mountain streams because of ongoing glacier shrinkage. This is what a team of scientists from EPFL and Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, report in their latest research. Their observations are based on samples collected from 154 glacier-fed streams worldwide as part of the EPFL-led Vanishing Glaciers project.
Glacier-fed streams are murky, raging torrents in the summer. Large quantities of glacial meltwater churn up rocks and sediment, allowing very little light to reach the streambed, while freezing temperatures and snow in other seasons provide little opportunity for a rich microbiome to develop.
But, as glaciers shrink under the effects of global warming, the volume of water originating from glaciers is declining. That means the streams are becoming warmer, calmer, and clearer, giving algae and other microorganisms an opportunity to become abundant and to contribute more to local carbon and nutrient cycles.
""We're witnessing a process of profound change at the level of the microbiome in these ecosystems�nothing short of a 'green transition' because of the increased primary production,"" says Tom Battin, a full professor at EPFL's River Ecosystems Laboratory (RIVER).

Changing composition
In their paper, the scientists looked at the nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, in the stream water as well as the enzymes that microorganisms living in the streambed sediment produce in order to use these nutrients.

																																						
    
     



																																			Then, they looked at changes in both of these over a very large gradient of streams fed by glaciers that differ in size.
""Glacier-fed-stream ecosystems generally have limited quantities of carbon and nutrients, particularly phosphorous,"" explains Tyler Kohler, a former postdoc at RIVER and the paper's lead author.
""As glaciers shrink and the demand for phosphorus by algae and other microorganisms grows, phosphorus may become more limiting in high-mountain streams."" Hence phosphorus, a critical building block for life, will become even more rare in downstream ecosystems, with yet unknown impacts for their food webs.
These findings are supported by a paper published in Royal Society Open Science in August 2023 by scientists from the Vanishing Glaciers project. In this study, the authors analyzed the microbiome of a small glacier-fed stream in the Rwenzori Mountains, in Uganda, where the ""green transition"" was already at an advanced stage. Here, the nutrient and enzyme composition was also much different, and algae were abundant.
""What's happening with the Rwenzori glacier gives us a glimpse of what Swiss glacier-fed streams will look like 30 or 50 years from now,"" says Battin. One outcome of this change is that as glacier-fed streams host more microbial life, they will play a bigger role in biogeochemical cycles such as CO2 fluxes.

																																			The RIVER team plans to build on this research. They are conducting a census of the microbial biodiversity in glacier-fed streams and, using various lines of genomic information, are exploring how diverse microorganisms are able to dwell in one of Earth's most extreme freshwater ecosystems.
Tyler Kohler, lead author and currently a researcher at the Department of Ecology at Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague was responsible for sample collection during expeditions, laboratory analyses, and writing of the manuscript. Tyler is currently the PI of a Charles University PRIMUS project titled: ""Green New World: Unraveling microbial community assembly patterns in vanishing glacier-fed streams.""
In this project, Tyler's team is further continuing this research by focusing on how the algal communities (specifically diatoms) are changing in glacier-fed streams with climate change.

Over the last four decades, warming climate and ocean temperatures have rapidly altered the Greenland Ice Sheet, creating concern for marine ecosystems and weather patterns worldwide. The environment has challenged scientists in their attempts to measure how water moves around and melts the ice sheet because equipment can be destroyed by icebergs floating near the glaciers.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	Collected using a novel approach, research from the University of Maine has unearthed new information to help scientists better understand circulation patterns of ocean water around glaciers. A group of pioneers in glacial research attached GPS devices to icebergs and used their mobility to understand fjord circulation, which can ultimately enhance the accuracy of climate models.
In the summers of 2014 and 2019, the GPS devices tracked hourly changes in the position of 13 icebergs as they passed through Greenland's Ilulissat Icefjord toward the ocean.
Starting as research during her time at the University of Oregon, UMaine assistant professor of geomatics Kristin Schild collected the fjord data with a colleague from UO, earth sciences professor and oceanographer David Sutherland.
In 2020, an undergraduate student, Sydney Baratta, used these datasets as the focus of her senior capstone project. Continuing the research into her graduate studies, Baratta processed and analyzed her findings and published the results in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans.
Study results showed circulation in the primary fjord is greatly affected by freshwater flow from connecting tributary fjords, which is critically important to consider in circulation models. Such models can range from studying ocean currents to predicting the speed at which sea level could rise.
""Being able to utilize the many icebergs that are in this fjord is really unique to the study,"" said Baratta.
Ilulissat Icefjord is home to Sermeq Kujalleq, one of the fastest and most active glaciers in the world. This makes the fjord a good, but challenging location to understand glaciers' interaction with the ocean and predict how the icy giants respond to ocean warming.
""Think about ice cubes in a glass of water. They float,"" said Baratta. ""But if it's in a fjord, under the influence of other forces like wind and the currents, the icebergs move around. What we wanted to do was put GPS trackers on those icebergs to infer what the circulation in the fjord is and see how that is influenced by the environment.""
Carlos Moffat, who researches glacier-ocean interactions and polar oceanography at the University of Delaware, said equipment stationed in fjords is commonly crushed by all the movement. How Schild collected these datasets, he said, was innovative. Instead of viewing the icebergs as an obstacle, she used them as a tool to carry and protect the equipment.
""It's a situation where the thing you're interested in is destroying your gear,"" said Moffat. ""So what they've done in this study is basically flip the script.""

																																						
    
     



																																			Impact beyond the Arctic
Greenland, where Ilulissat Icefjord is located, and Antarctica have the largest fresh water reservoirs of ice in the world. How quickly the ice sheets melt contribute to sea level rise worldwide. In Greenland and Antarctica, glaciers ""dip their toes"" in ocean water, Moffat said, which can allow ocean warming to accelerate how quickly the ice melts or breaks into icebergs.
Lauren Ross, UMaine associate professor of hydraulics and water resources engineering, said Baratta, Schild and Sutherland's findings will be useful for a range of research relating to fjord circulation, including her area of expertise�the transport of material in water.
She recently studied how freshwater flowing into a fjord negatively impacted the growth of a harmful microscopic algae. Unlike in Greenland, more freshwater helped the economy and ecosystems surrounding the fjord.
""In order to be as accurate as possible, we have to have the most accurate data to feed into the models,"" said Ross. ""I think it's going to become more and more important as the climate warms.""
Similar to Ross' reflection, Schild said recognizing that changes are happening in the environment is the starting point. Scientists are now working to fill gaps in research to represent the changing environment and create better predictive models.
""Glaciers have reshaped global climate and ecosystems for millions of years,"" said UMaine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy. ""Novel research from our world-renowned climate scientists provides more insight into how they interact with their surrounding environments and plays a vital role in predicting our climate future.""
While the ever-altering Greenland Ice Sheet has dramatic local impact, it is the top of a slippery slope slanted toward changes worldwide. What happens in the frozen fjords 2,000 miles to the north of Maine affects New England's seafood cuisine and has a role in the increasingly devastating storms along the coast.
""Everything is interconnected,"" said Baratta. ""Changes happening in the Arctic can have trickle-down effects that impact what we see in Maine.""

Global atmospheric methane concentrations have risen steadily since 2006. Growth in agriculture, transportation, and industry are partly to blame, but so too is the rise in biogenic emissions, or emissions from natural sources.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																					Biogenic sources are as varied and complex as the ecosystems from which they derive�recent work highlighted tree stems as one overlooked emitter�but wetlands stand out as the largest natural methane contributor. In fact, they account for about a third of total methane emissions, natural or otherwise. But understanding wetland methane dynamics is complicated because they are affected by so many factors, ranging from salinity to temperature to vegetation types to water levels. Into these soggy reaches wade Andrew Hill and colleagues, with an approach to disentangle these variables.
The authors combined empirical dynamic modeling and convergent cross mapping to analyze 5 years' worth of methane flux measurements in a salt marsh in the St. Jones Reserve, part of the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve and the AmeriFlux network. The algorithms incorporated 18 environmental measurements, from wind speed to atmospheric pressure, to characterize how they interact to shape methane emissions. The research is published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences.
The results showed that methane levels' response to environmental shifts can lag by up to 35 days. During the day, emissions changes were most closely tied to the ebb and flow of water levels. But seasonal patterns of emission rates were most influenced by fluctuations in temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, and gross primary production.
As methane emissions continue to climb, they could trigger a positive feedback loop in which rising atmospheric methane concentrations instigate greater ecosystem releases. By revealing the mechanics of methane dynamics in the salt marsh, the study offers a framework for improving wetland emission estimates and may help clarify a strategy for mitigating the rise in global methane concentrations.

Faulty warning systems, poverty and deforestation of mountains in the southern Philippines turned recent unseasonably heavy rains into deadly disasters, scientists said in a report Friday.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	More than 100 people were killed in landslides and floods in January and February on the country's second-largest island of Mindanao as the northeast monsoon and a low pressure trough brought downpours.
A study by the World Weather Attribution group found the unusually heavy rain in eastern Mindanao was not ""particularly extreme"".
But with people living in landslide-prone areas and shortcomings in weather alerts, the rains became ""devastating"".
""We can't just blame the rain for the severe impacts,"" said Richard Ybanez, chief science research specialist at the University of the Philippines' Resilience Institute.
""A range of human factors is what turned these downpours into deadly disasters.""
In the deadliest incident, more than 90 people were killed when the side of a mountain collapsed and smashed into a gold mining village on February 6, burying buses and houses.
While climate change was likely one of the drivers of the heavy rain, the report said scientists were not able to quantify its impact due to the lack of available data.
""However, we did detect a strong trend in the historical data�compared to the pre-industrial climate, the heaviest five-day periods of rainfall now drop around 50 percent more rainfall on Mindanao island in the December to February period,"" said Mariam Zachariah of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London.
The scientists found that a higher-than-average rate of poverty in the mountainous region had left people vulnerable to the impacts of heavier rainfall, while ""intensified deforestation"" had increased the risk of landslides.

																																						
    
     



																																			""Across the region of study, construction in areas declared 'no-build zones' raises these dangers considerably,"" the report said.
The report said policies, laws and funding of disaster risk management ""have largely stalled over the past decades"" and were concentrated on post-disaster response.
For example, automated sensors for rainfall and stream level in the region ""have not been recording data since at least 2022"", after funding for maintenance and data transmission was cut.
The report also faulted the country's weather forecasts and warnings, which ""have limited granularity on local risk and lack instructions on where and when to evacuate"".
""Evacuations from high-risk locations were carried out when the island was hit by the rainfall in late January. However, many people were still in harm's way,"" said Ybanez.
""It is critical that both early warning systems and assessment of landslide-prone areas are improved to avoid similar disasters in the future,"" he said.
The report also warned that the recent rains would have been ""more extreme"" were it not for the El Ni�o weather phenomenon causing drier conditions across the country.
The tropical archipelago nation�which is ranked among the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change�is usually affected by around 20 major storms a year.

Extraction of Earth's natural resources could surge 60 percent by 2060, imperiling climate goals and economic prosperity, the UN said Friday, calling for dramatic changes in energy, food, transport and housing.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	Enormous expansion of infrastructure, energy demand and consumer consumption over the last half century, particularly in wealthier countries, has driven a tripling of the world's use of materials, according to the 2024 Global Resource Outlook by the UN Environment Programme's International Resource Panel.
And the hunger for natural resources�everything from food to fossil fuels�keeps growing by an average of more than 2.3 percent per year, it said.
People in wealthy countries drive most of that demand, using six times more materials and responsible for ten times more climate impacts than those in low-income countries, according to the analysis.
Extraction and processing of the huge amount of resources accounts for over 60 percent of planet-warming emissions, the report said, as well as devastating ecosystems and harming human health.
Lead author Hans Bruyninckx said the current trajectory would cause the world to far exceed the temperature limits set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to cap global warming ""well below"" two degrees Celsius and preferably at 1.5C.
""You've got resource use that is increasing, too much impact on Earth systems that is not tenable,"" he told AFP, adding that unequal access to resources across the world was also ""untenable"".
But he acknowledged that natural resources will be needed ""to turn things around"", both to boost development in poorer nations and to provide the minerals and metals needed for the energy transition.
The report follows an agreement by countries at UN climate negotiations last year in Dubai, to triple global renewable energy capacity this decade and ""transition away"" from polluting fossil fuels.

																																						
    
     



																																			'Unprecedented scale and speed'
Without sweeping change, the report warned, the exploitation of Earth's resources will continue, with computer modeling suggesting an increase by almost 60 percent by 2060 from 2020 levels, from 100 to 160 billion tonnes.
""The only choice is to stabilize and balance the human relationship with the rest of nature,"" the report said.
""Weak, partial, fragmented or slow policies will not work. This can only be possible with far-reaching and truly systemic shifts in energy, food, mobility and the built environment implemented at an unprecedented scale and speed.""
It said policy changes, focused on high-consumption countries, could reduce the projected growth in resource use by a third, slash greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent and improve health�while still allowing economic growth.
Recommended actions, particularly in richer countries, include dietary changes that would reduce food waste and cut back on animal protein, more efficient transport systems, and denser housing using recycled building materials.
In developing countries where more resources are needed to improve lives, the report said the emphasis should be on maximizing the benefits and minimizing environmental and health impacts.
The report also called for the environmental costs of resource extraction to be priced into commodities and included in trade agreements.
""The economy is human made, it doesn't follow the laws of physics,"" Bruyninckx said.
""We made it in a certain direction, we can use the same government capacities to move it in a different direction.""

																					CO2 emissions from energy rose by 1.1 percent in 2023, increasing by 410 million tonnes to a record 37.4 billion tonnes, slowing down from a gain of 490 million tonnes in 2022, the IEA said in its annual update on emissions.
The IEA said that without technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear power and electric cars, the global increase in energy-related CO2 emissions over the last five years would have been three times larger the 900 million tonnes registered.
Over 40 percent of last year's increase in carbon emissions from energy resulted from severe droughts in China, the United States, India and elsewhere which cut hydro-electric output and forced utilities to resort to fossil fuels.
Without the water shortfalls, global carbon emissions from power generation alone would have fallen last year.
Energy carbon emissions rose in China and India in 2023, while advanced economies saw a record fall even as their economies grew. Their emissions dropped to a 50-year low as coal demand fell back to levels not seen since the early 1900s.
For the first time last year, at least half the power generated in advanced economies came from low-emissions sources like renewables and nuclear.
Even as China's emissions grew, it added as much solar PV capacity in 2023 as the entire world did in 2022.
""The clean energy transition has undergone a series of stress tests in the last five years -� and it has demonstrated its resilience,"" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.
""A pandemic, an energy crisis and geopolitical instability all had the potential to derail efforts to build cleaner and more secure energy systems. Instead, we've seen the opposite in many economies.""

Gusty weekend winds were threatening to worsen a million-acre wildfire that has already killed two people in the southern US, as a monster blizzard engulfed California's mountains Friday.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	Fires are burning across northern Texas and neighboring Oklahoma, fueled by an unseasonably warm winter and ferocious winds.
After a slight dousing of rain that brought limited reprieve to firefighters on Thursday as they sought to get a handle on the out-of-control blazes, danger was forecast for Saturday.
""Critical fire weather conditions are expected to return midday Saturday and once again after sunrise Sunday,"" tweeted the National Weather Service in Amarillo, Texas.
Wind gusts up to 40 miles (65 kilometers) an hour could push the blaze into very dry grassland, spreading the boundaries of the fire even further.
The Smokehouse Creek fire started Monday and after merging with another blaze has now become the largest-ever wildfire in Texas at over one-million acres (over 4,000 square kilometers).
That makes it around the size of Rhode Island, or about three times the size of London.
Texas A&M Forest Service Fire Chief Wes Moorehead urged Texans to be careful over the weekend, when many celebrate Texas Independence Day on March 2.
""As firefighters continue to suppress active fires, we urge Texans to be cautious with any outdoor activity that may cause a spark,"" he said in a statement.
A 44-year-old truck driver died in an Oklahoma City hospital on Thursday, having been rescued near her smoke-engulfed truck in Smokehouse Creek on Tuesday, according to several local media.

																																						
    
     



																																			While evacuations were ordered in some places, the body of an 83-year-old woman was found in the city of Stinnett, a Hutchinson County emergency services spokesperson told ABC News.
She also said about 20 structures in Stinnett had been razed by the fire.
A 120-year-old Texas ranch said it lost 80 percent of its 32,000-acre property near the area of the largest fire.
""The loss of livestock, crops, and wildlife, as well as ranch fencing and other infrastructure throughout our property as well as other ranches and homes across the region is, we believe, unparalleled in our history,"" the managers of Turkey Track Ranch said.
�-
Over on the US West Coast, the Sierra Nevada mountain range was getting walloped Friday by a blizzard that could dump as much as 12 feet (over three-and-a-half meters) of snow.
The life-threatening winter storm was bringing ferocious winds, with gusts as high as 145 miles an hour recorded at Palisades Tahoe in the northern part of the range.
There will be ""whiteout conditions with near zero-visibility at times due to blowing snow,"" the NWS warned.
""Do not travel. If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay in your vehicle.""
Backcountry areas could also experience avalanches, the Sierra Avalanche Center warned.
Meteorologists say the weather system is particularly strong and very cold, coming in from the Pacific Northwest and ferrying a lot of moisture inland.
Courtney Carpenter of the NWS in Sacramento told the San Francisco Chronicle that a storm of this magnitude happens once every few years.
""This just happens to have the perfect combination of enough cold air and just the track of the storm that leads to a lot of snow flowing up into the mountains,"" she said.
While both winter storms and wildfires are naturally occuring and expected phenomena, human-caused climate change is exacerbating the strength and unpredictability of both.
A warmer atmosphere disrupts long-established weather patterns, bringing more intense periods of drought in some areas and heavier precipitation in others.

																																	Four major fires are actively burning across the state's northern area, known as the Texas panhandle, as well as neighboring Oklahoma, fueled by an unseasonably hot winter and ferocious winds.
""Most of the fire received some precipitation yesterday and there was no fire growth,"" the Texas A&M Forest Service posted on X about the Smokehouse Creek Fire, the largest of the five.
It started Monday and now covers an estimated 1,075,000 acres (435,000 hectares), and is 15 percent contained.
But the reprieve could be short lived, as ""Critical fire weather conditions are expected to return midday Saturday and once again after sunrise Sunday,"" tweeted the National Weather Service in Amarillo.
It cited very dry grass, wind gusts of 40 miles (64 kilometers) per hour and minimum relative humidity of 5-10 percent.
With Smokehouse Creek merging with another blaze, it has now become the state's largest-ever wildfire, surpassing the East Amarillo Complex disaster that torched 907,000 acres in 2006.
Texas A&M Forest Service Fire Chief Wes Moorehead urged Texans to be cautious over the weekend, when many celebrate Texas Independence Day on March 2, in light of the expected conditions.

Arts and culture can bring imagination and momentum to projects for putting urban neighborhoods more in tune with nature.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	In the Dutch capital Amsterdam, a thoroughfare called the Stadhouderskade is being reclaimed by residents. They're turning the car-clogged artery into a two-kilometer-long haven for nature and people.
Students of art, engineering, mathematics, science and technology are helping to drive the transformation. Their role is to offer artistic, social and technical advice on remodeling the road section located along a main canal and near the Rijksmuseum, home to paintings by Dutch 17th century masters such as Rembrandt van Rijn and Johannes Vermeer.
Dutch designs
The ""Green Mile"" is an initiative by six Dutch organizations that include the Rijksmuseum, brewer Heineken�whose headquarters are on the Stadhouderskade�the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, the Dutch National Bank, architecture firm UNStudio and consultancy Blendingbricks.
""Arts and culture can challenge people to get out of their usual way of thinking,"" said Annemie Wyckmans, a professor of sustainable architecture at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim.
Wyckmans leads a research project that received EU funding to examine how engaging with a broad range of groups including the artistic and cultural sectors can stimulate sustainable change. Called CRAFT, the three-year project runs through April 2025 and features the Amsterdam initiative as a leading example.
The CRAFT team is drawing inspiration from an EU initiative to bring the European ""Green Deal"" to the places where people live. Called ""New European Bauhaus,"" or NEB, it wants people's daily lives and living spaces to get inspiration from art and culture, be in harmony with nature and involve social interaction.
Like the Bauhaus movement in Germany a century ago, the NEB aims to fuse urban design, science, technology, art and community spirit. Art itself can be a driving force because it is widely on display in cities and has the power to galvanize people.
The EU is organizing an NEB festival in the Belgian capital Brussels on 9�13 April.

																																						
    
     



																																			Shining lights
With its Stadhouderskade initiative, Amsterdam is one of three leading cities among more than 70 coming together under CRAFT to share knowledge and experience. The other two main ones are Bologna in Italy and the Czech capital Prague.
In Bologna, an old railyard is being renovated to create sheds and open areas where arts, sports and other social activities can take place. In Prague, art installations are being placed in public spaces and the general public is being asked to provide feedback.
All three cities are bringing together a variety of local voices and testing new ways to spur and guide the transformation. In some cases, that means including community members in urban decision-making; in others it involves linking up municipal departments that otherwise often act in isolation.
""We are emphasizing the role of art and education in igniting this change,"" said Wyckmans. ""We believe that art can connect people, offer new perspectives and enrich the dialogue between the different stakeholders.""
In Amsterdam, the transformation of the Stadhouderskade is well underway and a range of activities is due to continue for the rest of the decade.
In June 2023, an ""insect hotel"" was installed in a park named after 20th century Dutch painter Carel Willink. The wooden structure, which vaguely resembles a birdhouse complete with a sloping wooden roof, gives insects such as ladybirds, butterflies and solitary bees a place to spend the night, hibernate or just stay. It even faces south-west to increase warmth.
In September, a group of around 80 residents, workers and other interested people joined an initial clean-up activity along the Stadhouderskade. They collected plastic litter, cigarette butts and other waste for almost four hours, wrapping up with drinks at Heineken.
The ultimate goal is for the mile-long stretch, which is among the most congested, dirty and noisy parts of Amsterdam, to have fewer cars and more trees, bushes and parks for creatures of all kinds.
""By 2030, we want to transform the Stadhouderskade into a green, sustainable, safe and vibrant thoroughfare for all life forms,"" said Rob Andeweg, program manager at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. ""And we want to do this by fostering a sense of ownership among local residents and users of the area and by allowing the unheard voices of nature and animals to be heard.""

																																			Creative spark
Another EU-funded research project�CreaTures�took a playful approach to altering perceptions and possibilities regarding urban change.
It featured a group of strangers who gathered in Finsbury Park in the UK capital London in 2022 wearing masks depicting different animals, insects and plants.
Each mask represented a particular life form living in the park and the person wearing the disguise was the spokesperson of the species depicted.
The event was part of a role-play game to explore how this particular public space could be used in a way that answered the needs of all of its inhabitants, not just people.
""Players act and think like a dog, bee or even grass and help change the way we all see and participate in our local urban green spaces and significantly alter community relations with local biodiversity,"" the local initiative said on its website.
Just doing it
CreaTures�an acronym for Creative Practices for Transformational Futures�ran for three years through 2022 and explored ways for the arts to address climate change.
It catalogued current creative practices, experimented with others and offered an overall evaluation.
CreaTures included representatives from Finland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the UK. Besides London, it worked in several locations including Helsinki, Ljubljana and Seville, each with diverse experiments.
By testing ways for the creative arts to spur more people to engage actively with their environments, the project team wanted to build a common resource from which others could draw.
""There are many academic articles saying what needs to be done but very few examples of how to actually do it,"" said Tuuli Mattelm�ki, an associate professor in design at Aalto University in Finland and coordinator of CreaTures.
The project produced a collection of 20 experimental productions. Each was proposed by an artist or group of artists and then drew on the ideas of all project participants.

																																						
    
     



																																			Enterprising experiments
The Finsbury Park initiative, for example, was put forward by two cultural organizations�one based in London and the other in Berlin.
Like several other CreaTures experiments, this one is expected to have an impact beyond the life of the project. The borough responsible for Finsbury Park plans to invite local residents to sign a ""treaty of cooperation"" with park biodiversity and monitor the effect.
Another CreaTures experiment was an interactive online social-care platform inspired by ""Social Solidarity Clinics"" in Greece during the height of the financial and migration crises in the previous decade. A further experiment offers an open-source board game that encourages players to pool their resources rather than compete to accumulate goods.
The impact of human food production on climate change led to a cookbook with 11 ""More-than-Human Food Futures"" recipes meant to provoke reflection about diets that support environmental sustainability.
One recipe links a sustainable and healthy diet with the idea of glamorous food by combining seaweed, spirulina, rice, pomegranate and ice cream.
Another recipe challenges the notion of ""pests"" in nature, saying many invasive species have positive effects. It gives the example of lupin, which in Sweden is regarded as an unwanted garden invader but is a source of protein for cows.

																																			Global impact
Since the project ended, people worldwide have been using its guidance on what artistic actions work best for particular initiatives, according to Mattelm�ki.
It even gets a nod in a United Nations report published in December 2023. The UN document, entitled ""The Most Creative Look to the Future,"" argues that true innovation is impossible without the skills and behavior fostered by imagination and creativity.
When it comes to combating climate change, Mattelm�ki said the power of the arts is too often underestimated and underused.
""Through arts and culture, an openness of interpretation is created that can challenge the status quo,"" she said.
New European Bauhaus
A century after it emerged in Germany, the Bauhaus school of art, architecture and design is getting a rebirth in Europe in a bid to improve urban life.
The New European Bauhaus (NEB) aims to help cities across the EU become less polluting and more attractive through artistic, cultural and technological projects reaching many millions of residents.
Initiated by the European Commission in 2020, the NEB has three prime goals: reduce environmental harm including climate change, tackle social inequalities such as exclusion and spruce up public areas.
Changing the design and use of urban spaces and structures is central to the whole undertaking, with sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics shaping the overall vision.
While serving policy goals set at EU level, the NEB relies on bottom-up initiatives undertaken by a range of people and organizations. These include city dwellers, artistic groups, architectural experts and local businesses, authorities and students.
Research is a main feature of the NEB, with almost �160 million for EU projects in 2021�2024.

Government scientists have cooked up a new concept for how to potentially cool an overheating Earth: Fiddle with the upper atmosphere to make it a bit drier.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	Water vapor�water in its gas form�is a natural greenhouse gas that traps heat, just like carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and gas. So researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA figure if they can just inject ice high up in the air, water vapor in the upper atmosphere would get a bit drier and that could counteract a small amount of the human-caused warmth.
It's just the spark of an initial idea, said the lead author of a study in Wednesday's journal Science Advances.
The idea of drying the upper atmosphere is the newest addition to what some scientists are calling a last-ditch toolbox to deal with climate change by manipulating the world's atmosphere or oceans. Known as geoengineering, it's often rejected because of potential side effects, and is usually mentioned not as an alternative to reducing carbon pollution, but in addition to emission cuts.
""This isn't something that we can even implement right now,"" said Joshua Schwarz, a NOAA physicist who is lead author of a study in Wednesday's journal Science Advances. ""This is about exploring what might be possible in the future and identifying research directions.""

																																						
    
     



																																			The way it would conceivably work is that high-tech planes could inject ice particles about 11 miles (17 kilometers) high, just below the stratosphere, where the air slowly rises. Then the ice and cold air rise to where it's coldest and gets the water vapor to turn to ice and fall, dehydrating the stratosphere, Schwarz said. So far there is no workable injection technique, he said.
At its maximum, injecting 2 tons a week, it could conceivably take out enough water vapor to reduce heating a small amount, about 5% of the overall warming created by carbon from the burning of fossil fuel, Schwarz said. It's not much and shouldn't be used as an alternative to cutting pollution, he said.
Schwarz is not quite sure about what side effects could occur, and that's the problem, other scientists said.
Purposely tinkering with Earth's atmosphere to fix climate change is likely to create cascading new problems, said University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who wasn't part of the study. He said the engineering side of this makes sense, but he compared the concept to a children's story where a king who loves cheese is overrun with mice, gets cats to deal with the mice, then dogs to chase away the cats, lions to get rid of the dogs and elephants to eliminate the lions and then goes back to mice to scare off the elephants.
It makes more sense to deal with the initial problem�the cheese or the carbon dioxide, Weaver said.

																																			Scripps Institution of Oceanography atmospheric chemist Lynn Russell, who wasn't part of the research, said the idea is worth examining, but the study ""doesn't have a lot of answers given all the uncertainties.""
Groups from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to the United Nations Environment Programme have looked at the ethics, side effects, legal complications and benefits of geoengineering with various degrees of skepticism and cautious interest.
At the UN environment assembly, nations are considering a resolution to study solar radiation modification�essentially putting particles in the air to reflect sunlight and cool the atmosphere�and possible regulations on countries or companies that would do it.
""If you're going to do lab experiments indoors, maybe that's all right,"" UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. ""But we do believe, from a UNEP perspective, that the moment we step outdoors and we begin to do small- and large-scale experimentation outdoors we need actually need to have a global conversation.""
""I do think that solar radiation modification is a little bit like artificial intelligence,"" Andersen said. ""Once a genie is out of the bottle, you can't put it back in. It's a technology that is there. We do not think in any way shape or form that it should be considered as a climate solution.""

Researchers using a novel method of measuring long-term wildfire smoke exposure have found that Indigenous communities in California are exposed to disproportionate amounts of dangerous particulate matter�sometimes far beyond what has been previously known.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	Using a novel series of metrics that better reflects prolonged, community-level smoke exposure, researchers found that these communities were exposed to disproportionate amounts of smoke every year from 2006 to 2020. Indigenous communities were exposed to about 1.7 times as much wildfire smoke, on average, as would be expected based on their statewide populations.
What's more, researchers say their new matrix for measuring exposures will help public health experts better understand the long-term effects of wildfire smoke for both environmental justice and epidemiological studies.
That understanding is critical in vulnerable communities. It's also increasingly important because millions of people nationwide now experience toxic, smoke-filled skies as wildfires worsen due to climate change, said Rachel Morello-Frosch, a University of California, Berkeley, professor of public health and of environmental science, policy and management and co-author of the paper.
""Now that wildfires are coming at us sequentially and clearly are going to be increasing in frequency and intensity, we can't look at them one at a time,"" Morello-Frosch said. ""We have to look at them using a more cumulative exposure framework.""
The study, published this month in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is believed to be the first of its kind to take such a robust look at exposure assessment.

																																						
    
     



																																			Scientists have long studied the pollution that comes out of tailpipes, chimneys, and power plants. Known as particulate matter, those levels of pollution�measured by thousands of EPA monitors around the country�hold relatively steady throughout the year. Those individual pollution daily values are often averaged over the course of a year. That information is then used by researchers to understand a community's or individual's long-term particulate matter exposure level.
That's how researchers historically have studied how exposure to poor air quality in, for example, California's San Joaquin Valley, might lead to increased rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease years later.
There's a problem, though. The data that make those studies possible are usually averaged. That means toxic air from a single mega-fire that blankets a community for a few days in August might be smoothed over in the annual calculation. The average masks the extremes. And the extreme might be what really matters for health, especially when such extremes are becoming more frequent in the context of climate change.
This ultimately makes it more difficult to track the long-term health impacts of wildfire smoke.
Researchers have increasingly done shorter-term analyses to see how a week of smoke drives up emergency room visits. But those fail to evaluate the potential longer-term health effects, particularly when there are repeated wildfire events.

																																			Morello-Frosch likened the current landscape of wildfire smoke research to earlier studies of how industrial incidents, like a chemical plant disaster, affected communities. Researchers used to focus on those individual incidents. Only later did scientists begin understanding how cumulative exposure�rather than individual incidents�was an important predictor of health.
To look for how those individual incidents might be part of a broader health story, the research team proposed five new metrics that can be used together to assess better the duration, frequency and intensity of wildfire smoke exposure. Factors like the number of smoke waves that blanket a specific area for two consecutive days or the peak exposure week of the year can help researchers spot exposures that might otherwise have been missed.
""That may really matter for certain types of disease processes much more than the average smoothed out over the year,"" said Joan Casey, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Washington and the paper's lead author.
""Those two things may not be equal,"" she added. ""This paper is one of the first that actually starts trying to contend with this problem.""
Researchers have previously documented how California census tracts with a higher proportion of Indigenous people experienced relatively higher amounts of acreage burned. But nobody had looked at repeated smoked exposure year after year in those communities, Casey said.

																																						
    
     



																																			""People living in California understand one year is a horrible wildfire year, and in another year, maybe there's not that much smoke,"" Casey said. ""But we see every single year in this study period that American Indian/Native American people are disproportionately exposed to wildfire smoke.""
Air quality studies typically rely on the EPA's vast network of monitors and sensors. Those sensors don't detail where particulate matter comes from. To overcome that for this study, Tarik Benmarhnia, a co-author and an associate professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, used satellite images that detect smoke to identify where and when particulate matter spikes in the sensors were caused by fire.
That vast amount of data, combined with machine learning tools, will allow researchers to estimate community exposures in more granular detail and assess potential long-term health risks in new ways for future studies.
""Developing such metrics to capture populations' exposures to such repeated events can help provide a more nuanced and realistic picture of how novel environmental hazards can lead to inequities across various communities,"" Benmarhnia said. ""Focusing on wildfire smoke is particularly timely, as this has become the major source of air pollution in the past few years.""
The research raises significant questions about environmental justice, the team said. The scientists also hope it serves as a starting point for others to begin thinking of new ways to quantify human exposure to other hazards�like floods�that may have health effects years down the road.
""The beauty of this paper is that it provides a proof of concept about how we need to be looking at the effects of a wildfire on communities at a granular level,"" Morello-Frosch said. ""It's a really great foundation for how to assess exposures in this long-term framework in order to more accurately assess health effects of perennial fire events that are no longer restricted to the western part of the United States.""

Climate change is heating the oceans, altering currents and circulation patterns responsible for regulating climate on a global scale. If temperatures dropped, some of that damage could theoretically be undone.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	But employing ""emergency"" atmospheric geoengineering later this century in the face of continuous high carbon emissions would not be able to reverse changes to ocean currents, a new study finds. This would critically curtail the intervention's potential effectiveness on human-relevant timescales.
Oceans, especially the deep oceans, absorb and lose heat more slowly than the atmosphere, so an intervention that cools the air would not be able to cool the deep ocean on the same timescale, the authors found.
Stratospheric aerosol injection is a commonly discussed geoengineering concept based on the idea that adding particles to the stratosphere could help cool the surface of the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space.
This could help stabilize the planet if warming exceeds the 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cap set by the Paris Climate Agreement, which the planet is on track to exceed under current emission rates. (Global temperatures surpassed that threshold for several months in 2023 due to a combination of factors in addition to climate change, such as El Ni�o.)
But whether the injections would work is still heavily debated.
Previous research hints that a steady trickle of aerosol injections would help cool the surface of the planet. But the new study suggests that while an abrupt aerosol injection later this century could provide some ocean cooling, it wouldn't be enough to nudge ""stubborn"" ocean patterns such as Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which some research finds is already weakening.
In that case, preexisting problems resulting from a warmed deep ocean, such as altered weather patterns, regional sea level rise and weakened currents, would remain in place even as the atmosphere and surface ocean cooled.
""The big picture result is that we believe we can control the surface temperature of the Earth, but other components of the climate system will not be so fast to respond,"" said Daniel Pfl�ger, a physical oceanographer at Utrecht University who led the study. ""We need to bring down emissions as fast as possible. We're only talking about geoengineering because the political will for emission mitigation is lacking.""
The study was published in Geophysical Research Letters, AGU's journal for high-impact, short-format reports with immediate implications spanning all Earth and space sciences.

																																						
    
     



																																			Warm planet, wild swings
Scientists know the surface of the planet can cool when large volumes of particles are added to the atmosphere because of events such as volcanic eruptions, which naturally emit gases and fine particles. For instance, in 1815, an eruption at Mt. Tambora in Indonesia launched so much material into the air that it cooled the planet the following year.
Aerosol injection is based on a similar principle whereby the atmosphere is made more reflective to send incoming solar radiation back into space, cooling the planet.
Because of this, Pfl�ger wanted to test how the atmosphere, shallow ocean, and deep ocean would respond to a steady trickle of aerosol injections over decades as opposed to a big, abrupt injection beginning later in the century. Would such an emergency measure be able to reverse ocean changes?
Pfl�ger and his colleagues simulated two aerosol injection scenarios, both with high carbon emissions. In one scenario, people started slowly adding particles into the atmosphere in 2020. In the other, beginning in 2080, people inject a large initial quantity of aerosols to bring the amount of warming back to 1.5 degrees Celsius and then continue to add enough aerosols to maintain that level of cooling.

																																			The team found that in the 2020 scenario, gradual stratospheric aerosol injections maintain ocean temperatures, structure, and circulation patterns roughly similar to today.
In the 2080 scenario, the abrupt aerosol injection cooled the Earth's surface, including the top 100 meters (330 feet) of the ocean, to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average in about 10 years. However, the deep oceans remained warmer than average, and critical ocean circulation patterns remained altered. The intervention was not entirely successful.
The study shows that aerosol injection ""might be able to slow down or prevent climate tipping points from happening in the first place,"" said Daniele Visioni, a climate scientist at Cornell University who was not involved in the research. But aerosol injection ""cannot magically restore things.""
""We cannot kick the can down the road forever,"" he said.
The extreme climate situations modeled here are neither desirable nor likely, Pfl�ger said. However, they provide a good baseline for understanding how Earth systems react to aerosol injections. Ultimately, geoengineering can be useful�but it cannot be the whole solution, he said.
Relying on geoengineering is ""in a way, madness,"" Pfl�ger said. ""But the situation is already quite mad.""
The research is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

Massive volcanic events in Earth's history that released large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere frequently correlate with periods of severe environmental change and mass extinctions. A new method to estimate how much and how rapidly carbon was released by the volcanoes could improve our understanding of the climate response, according to an international team led by researchers from Penn State and the University of Oxford.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	The scientists report in the journal Nature Geoscience that they have developed a new technique to estimate excess mercury left behind in the rock record due to ancient volcanic activity. The technique can estimate carbon emissions from large igneous provinces (LIPs), volcanic events that can last millions of years and produce magma that reaches Earth's surface and forms lava flows hundreds of miles long.
""Large igneous provinces are often used as an analog for human-caused climate change because they occur relatively rapidly geologically and release a lot of carbon dioxide,"" said Isabel Fendley, assistant research professor of geosciences at Penn State and lead author of the study. ""But one big challenge we address with this study is that to date, it has been really difficult to figure out exactly how much carbon was released by these volcanoes.""
The researchers analyzed core samples that capture a 20-million-year record of the early Jurassic period and found that mercury levels increased during the peak activity of the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province and the associated Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, a period of extensive environmental and climate change some 185 million years ago.
However, the total estimated carbon emissions using the mercury records were significantly lower than what carbon-cycle models had predicted would be necessary to cause the observed environmental changes.

																																						
    
     



																																			The findings suggest the volcanism triggered positive Earth system feedbacks�climate and environmental responses to the initial warming that in turn produced more warming. These positive feedbacks may be as important as the primary emissions in these large carbon emission scenarios, and current carbon cycle models may be underestimating the effects of a given amount of emissions, the scientists said.
""What this shows us is that there are Earth system responses that exacerbate the effects of the carbon the volcanoes emitted,"" Fendley said. ""And based on our results, these feedback processes are actually quite important but not well understood.""
Accurate estimates of LIP carbon emissions are important for understanding the impacts of positive and negative carbon-cycle feedback processes on future climate projections, the scientists said.


    
        
            
             
                Scientists walk near the site of Mochras Farm (Llanbedr) borehole in Wales. Credit: Stephen Hesselbo
                    
    

""In addition to historical climate change and understanding the history of life, it's also relevant for how we understand Earth's climate and how we investigate what happens to the environment after you release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,"" Fendley said.
Estimating the quantity of carbon emissions associated with LIPs has been a challenge in part because scientists have an incomplete record of how much lava erupted. The Karoo-Ferrar LIP, for example, occurred on the former supercontinent Gondwana, and that material is now spread out across the southern hemisphere, spanning modern-day Southern Africa, Antarctica and Tasmania, the scientists said.

																																			The researchers instead turned to mercury, which is released as a gas during volcanic eruptions but was otherwise rarely found in high concentrations in the environment prior to human activity. Looking at the chemistry of rocks in the core samples, the scientists were able to determine how much mercury would be expected based on environmental conditions and how much extra was present caused by the volcanoes.
They developed a method to convert the measured changes in mercury concentrations to the volume of mercury gas emissions. Using the ratio of mercury gas emissions to carbon emissions in modern volcanoes, they estimated how much carbon the ancient volcanoes released.
The researchers said the core samples, from the Mochras borehole in Wales, U.K., provided a unique opportunity to conduct this research. The long record showed the first clear evidence that there were significantly larger volcanic eruptions during this time period compared to the preceding 15 million years, the scientists said.
""The large amount of existing geochemical data from the Mochras Farm (Llanbedr) borehole in Wales, drilled by the British Geological Survey, plus the very well-constrained chronology, provided a unique opportunity that enabled this analysis,"" Fendley said. ""The decades-worth of previous work on the Mochras core enabled us to reconstruct original gas fluxes over millions of years, for periods that are traditional targets for paleo-environmental studies as well as the background state.""
Other researchers on this project were Joost Frieling, postdoctoral research assistant, and Tamsin Mather and Hugh Jenkyns, professors, at the University of Oxford; Michael Ruhl, assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin; and Stephen Hesselbo, professor at the University of Exeter.

The modeling results, published in Scientific Reports, also suggest that there is an estimated 90% chance of record-breaking global mean surface temperatures occurring over the same period under a moderate or strong El Ni�o scenario.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																					The El Ni�o-Southern Oscillation, centered in the tropical Pacific, is a key driver of climate variability around the world. Both its warm phase, El Ni�o, and its colder phase, La Ni�a, influence weather conditions, with the heat released to the atmosphere from the western Pacific Ocean during an El Ni�o leading to an accelerated rise in annual global mean surface temperatures (GMST). A slight increase in GMST has been strongly linked to significant increases in surface air temperatures during extreme regional heating events.
Congwen Zhu and colleagues modeled the effects of the 2023�24 El Ni�o on the regional variation in average surface air temperatures from the 1951�1980 mean between July 2023 and June 2024. They used this period to ensure that the typical peak of an El Ni�o event, between November and January, was always included.
The authors found that under a moderate El Ni�o scenario, the Bay of Bengal and the Philippines were predicted to experience record-breaking average surface air temperatures over the period.
Under a strong El Ni�o, the Caribbean Sea, South China Sea, and areas of the Amazon and Alaska were also predicted to experience record-breaking average surface air temperatures.
The authors also modeled the effects of El Ni�o on GMST over the same period and found that under a moderate or stronger El Ni�o, there was a 90% chance that GMST would break the historical record. In the moderate scenario, the authors estimated the 2023�24 GMST as being 1.03�1.10 �C above the benchmark 1951�1980 mean, while for the strong scenario, they estimated GMST as 1.06�1.20 �C above that mean.
The authors warn that record-breaking average temperatures will likely challenge regions' current capability to cope with the consequences of excess heat.
They also note that high surface air temperatures can lead to a significant increase in the likelihood of extreme climate events�including wildfires, tropical cyclones, and heat waves�particularly in oceanic and coastal areas where the higher heat capacity of the ocean leads to climate conditions persisting for extended periods of time.

Climate change is disrupting the seasonal flow of rivers in the far northern latitudes of America, Russia and Europe and is posing a threat to water security and ecosystems, according to research published in Science.


										      
         
        
        
        
      
																																	A team of scientists led by the University of Leeds analyzed historical data from river gauging stations across the globe and found that 21% of them showed significant alterations in the seasonal rise and fall in water levels.
The study used data-based reconstructions and state-of-the-art simulations to show that river flow is now far less likely to vary with the seasons in latitudes above 50�N than previously, and that this could be directly linked to changes to the climate caused by human activity.
Until now, evidence suggesting that climate change has had an impact on river flow seasonality has been limited to local studies or has failed to consider the impact of climate change brought about by humans explicitly.
In this study, the team used monthly average river flow measurements from 10,120 gauging stations from 1965 to 2014.
For the first time ever, they were able to exclude direct human interventions such as reservoir management or water extraction, to show that widespread reduction in river flow seasonality was driven by climate change.
Lead author, Hong Wang, a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Leeds and the Southern University of Science and Technology in China, said, ""Our research shows that rising air temperatures are fundamentally altering the natural patterns of river flow.
""The concerning aspect of this change is the observed weakening of river flow seasonality, and that this is as a direct consequence of historical human-induced emissions. This signals a sustained and considerable diminishment of river flow seasonality if air temperatures continue to rise.""

																																						
    
     



																																			Human impact on river flow
Human activities are altering river flow patterns worldwide, both directly through flow regulations such as reservoirs, and indirectly through land use change and the impacts of climate change on air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and snowmelt.
Over two-thirds of the world's rivers have already been altered by humans even without considering the indirect impacts of increases in greenhouse gases and aerosols.
River flow seasonality plays a critical role in the predicted cycle of floods and droughts. A weakening of these peaks and troughs can threaten water security and freshwater biodiversity. For example, a substantial portion of the early meltwater from snowpack depletion may quickly flow into oceans and therefore not be available for human use.
Weakening river flow seasonality�for example, due to a reduction in spring and early summer river levels in snowmelt regions�can also have an impact downstream on riverbank vegetation and organisms living in the river itself.
Gauging the seasonal flow
In northern North America, the researchers found that 40% of the 119 stations observed showed a significant decrease in river flow seasonality. Similar results were also observed in southern Siberia with 32% of stations showing a significant decrease.

There was a comparable pattern in Europe, with 19% of the river gauging stations experiencing a significant decrease�mainly in northern Europe, western Russia and the European Alps.

																																			In addition, regions in the contiguous United States (the lower 48 states in North America, including the District of Columbia) showed predominantly decreasing trends of river flow seasonality overall, except for rivers in the Rocky Mountains and Florida.
In central North America, the research showed significant decreasing river flow seasonality trends in 18% of the stations.
By contrast, the researchers found a significant increase in river flow seasonality in 25% of the gauging stations in southeast Brazil, showing that changes to the water cycle are having a different impact in some parts of the world.
Dr. Megan Klaar, an Associate Professor in the University of Leeds School of Geography and a member of water@leeds, co-authored the research. She said, ""The highs and lows of river flow during the different seasons provide vital cues for the species living in the water.
""For example, a lot of fish use particular increases in the water as a cue to run to their breeding areas upstream or towards the sea. If they don't have those cues, they won't be able to spawn.""
The research concludes that there is a need to accelerate climate adaptation efforts to safeguard freshwater ecosystems by managing flows to try to recreate some of the natural systems and processes that are being lost.
Professor Joseph Holden, the Director of water@leeds and who supervised Hong Wang's research, added, ""A lot of concern is based upon what climate change will do in the future but our research signals that it's happening now and that increases in air temperature are driving huge changes in river flow.
""We should be very concerned about what the future holds given accelerating climate change and begin to think about mitigation strategies and adaptation planning to alleviate the future weakening of seasonal river flow, particularly in locations such as western Russia, Scandinavia, and Canada.""

Business,187,Pros And Cons Of Business Seller Financing,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2024/02/27/pros-and-cons-of-business-seller-financing/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/5f9ad70e7b83bbebb0ba9182/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,27-02-24,"Learn the reasons why business sellers may want to offer financing to buyers, along with a couple of reasons why they might not.",Pros And Cons Of Business Seller Financing,"An all-cash business sale may seem ideal, but it is quite rare. In the sale of both small and large businesses, it is common for the seller to finance a portion of the sale price.

For businesses with annual profits north of $2 million, there is an abundance of private equity and strategic buyer capital in the marketplace. Buyers of this type could easily cash out a seller, but they want leverage, so it is common for them to include seller financing in their offers.

For smaller companies, the Small Business Administration has popular loan programs for business acquisitions. In these deals, it is also quite common to see the seller finance a portion of the purchase price.


Why do so many business owners take less than 100% cash at closing for the business they poured their blood, sweat and tears into? Below, I�ll explore the reasons why sellers may want to offer financing to buyers, along with a couple of reasons why they might not.
The Pros Of Seller Financing
From the perspective of a business seller, here are some potential upsides of seller financing:
� In my experience, buyers typically view deals with seller financing as being less risky. Seller financing signals to the buyer that the seller believes in the business and its continued success. Moreover, when buyers perceive less risk along with growth opportunities, I�ve found that they tend to be willing to pay more for the business.

� Seller financing increases the pool of potential buyers and allows the seller and buyer to be more creative with deal terms than a bank would allow.
� In a seller-financed deal, the seller is like a bank, and like a bank, the seller will charge interest and can make significant returns on this interest. For example, with a 7%-8% interest rate with a 10-year amortization, a seller could realize a return in the ballpark of $30,000 to $40,000 for every $100,000 financed.


� The due diligence process is often more expedient because buyers feel assured by the seller having skin in the game.
� There are potential tax benefits. Seller financing typically involves spreading payments over five to 10 years. Taking a lump sum from a business sale would obviously increase the seller�s income in a year, which may result in them reaching a higher tax bracket. Spreading out payments may diminish this possibility; however, business sellers should consult a licensed tax advisor and a CPA on this potential benefit.
The Cons Of Seller Financing
There are some potential downsides to seller financing, as well:
� There�s a risk that the buyer could default on payment obligations. A buyer who turns out to lack managerial acumen or entrepreneurial skills could damage the business. This is why it is important for buyers to be vetted properly and for their loans to be secured. A business seller must think like a bank: Is the buyer a good fit? Does the buyer have transferable experience? Does the buyer have working capital to support the business?
� A seller-financed deal may attract a higher price, but it yields less immediate cash at closing. If the seller needs the cash for other investments or if the business has a lot of debt to pay off, then seller financing may not be a good option for the seller.
Careful Consideration Required
Using seller financing presents both opportunities and challenges. The potential pros are compelling: a widened pool of potential buyers, perceived lower risk leading to potentially higher sale prices, substantial interest income, a streamlined due diligence process and potential tax benefits.
However, one must approach seller financing with a prudent eye on the cons. Risk looms in the form of potential buyer default, necessitating thorough buyer vetting and robust loan security.
By carefully weighing the upsides and downsides, sellers can make informed choices and realize an attractive return for everything they poured into building a profitable business.

Business,188,How To Actually Enjoy Doing Your Business Finances: An Expert�s Advice,https://www.forbes.com/sites/biancabarratt/2024/02/29/how-to-actually-enjoy-doing-your-business-finances-an-experts-advice/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e0740fec2af010eb7a3146/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,29-02-24,"In my experience, nothing truly shines a light on how you feel about and interact with money as much as owning a business does.",How To Actually Enjoy Doing Your Business Finances: An Expert�s Advice,"In my experience, nothing truly shines a light on how you feel about and interact with money as much as owning a business does. When you're an entrepreneur, your business mirrors back to you every financial habit and assumption you've ever had and, without the safety net of a regular pay check and employee benefits, thrusts you into a world where financial responsibility rests squarely on your shoulders.


With countless tasks to juggle and multiple roles to assume simultaneously, it's all too easy to let financial matters slide until a pressing need�like filing taxes�forces you to confront them. Yet, as award-winning accountant Rachel Harris knows and continues to campaign for through her personal finance brand, @accountant_she, neglecting your financial wellbeing can have a profound impact on both your mental health and your business's success, stripping away the creativity and curiosity that led you to set up your own business in the first place.

�I�ve seen so many business owners who run successful, incredible businesses be absolutely crippled with financial anxiety,� Rachel comments. �Some people bury their heads in the sand, others overspend and others are frozen with fear. [That�s why] the transformation that financial wellbeing can have is so powerful.�


Growing up as a young carer for her twin sister and in a family where money was tight, Rachel knows first hand how difficult financial realities can shape you.

�I come from a family full of love, but not full of money. I was a free school meal child, wore charity shop clothes and my mum would walk us around [the supermarket] doing the food shop with a calculator in her hands, knowing to the penny how much we could spend on food for the week,� she recalls. �Having access to financial education through training to be an accountant and working with business owners has literally changed my life. It has changed my view of the world, my perspective of what a young woman who loves math can achieve and it�s changed my approach to nearly everything.�
Rachel�s journey to becoming an accountant certainly wasn�t conventional. Instead of attending university, she cared for her disabled sister, embarking on a business administration apprenticeship by day and studying for her Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) qualifications by night. It was whilst completing her training at a top 75 accountancy practice in Oxford that she became increasingly disillusioned with the lack of support provided to clients and the overwhelming corporate culture that prioritized profits over people.

Fuelled by this frustration, she pursued an MBA so that she could finally start her own practice, striveX, with her husband James in 2020. It was during this period, amongst lockdowns and working full time, that she also set up the instagram account @accountant_she (a play on the word Accountancy), creating fun and educational content on business finance and accounting. At the time of writing, striveX has since expanded from a one-person operation serving 50 clients to a team of 12 managing over 800 clients, they�ve opened a second branch in the north of the UK and @accuntant_she has become a brand in itself, reaching over 90,000 people across platforms. In both her business endeavors and her roles as a director and trustee of AAT, as well as a mentor and bursary trustee for aspiring accountants, Rachel�s message and mission is clear and consistent: business finances don�t have to be terrifying and you are not alone.

�I�m a disrupter in the accounting industry. I�m disrupting what it means to be an accountant, what it feels like to have an accountant and disrupting the concept that you can�t scale a business to seven figures without losing yourself,� she explains.


Of course, in order to achieve this, financial wellbeing practices are fundamental to Rachel�s own business and personal life and cultivating a mindset that reflects her goals has been paramount to her success so far. �Money is an amplifier of who you are,� she agrees. �I�m a great person, doing brilliant things in the world - personally and professionally for my industry and for women. Money gives me opportunities to extend who I am as a person.�
This concept is one that, theoretically, can seem appealing and obvious, but practically, can be overwhelming - particularly if running your own business is the first time you�ve had to get into the minutiae of finance. In fact, a 2023 study from Simply Business has revealed that 56% of small business owners in the UK have experienced poor mental health over the past 12 months and according to Tide�s new Female Business Owners UK Index, 37% of respondents said they struggle to manage cashflow.
Rachel agrees. �I specialize in tackling the way people feel about their finances, which seems to be the piece that lots of other accountants seem to miss.
�We all become self-employed to make money (in some way or another) but so many of us don�t tackle the piece that connects our wellbeing and emotions to money. By teaching sessions like financial wellbeing and mindful forecasting, I�m able to provide people with clarity on big topics whilst also reminding them that they come first,� she says. �It�s person centered, holistic finance, delivered in a way that makes people grow in confidence which ultimately, grows their business.�
In Rachel�s experience, the best way to build financial emotional resilience is to repeat certain helpful tasks over and over again. �It�s a muscle we need to build and use to maintain.�
Here are her top tips.
Start by defining your priorities
Injecting a simple yet impactful exercise into your financial planning routine can work wonders. Rachel likes to use the Wheel of Life with clients, which is a handy visual tool that lets you check in on different life areas like health, relationships, and work-life balance. By taking stock of these aspects upfront, you can make sure your financial strategies are in sync with your broader life goals. This way, your business plans don't just chase profits but also contribute to your overall happiness and fulfillment. Because, as Rachel says, �there�s no point planning a huge business [strategy] to triple their income for the coming year if fundamentally they are burnt out or desperately craving more time with their family. Instead, we could target them to make the same amount of income as last year, but by doing less.�
Manage your time
Prioritize your financial wellbeing by setting aside dedicated time. Block out at least 90 minutes for your initial financial deep dive, allowing yourself the opportunity to comprehensively assess your current situation. From there, schedule 30-minute sessions each month to maintain and refine your financial routine - consistency is key here and will ensure you keep on top of your financial health.
Financial tasks to keep on top of weekly
The best way to feel organized, Rachel says, is to stay on top of your accounting on a weekly basis. Begin by regularly checking your bank balance and the connection to your accountancy software so that you can monitor incoming and outgoing funds, then check that the records in your bank account match those in your accounting so that you can identify any discrepancies. She also suggests sending invoices quickly and inputting expenses and bills as and when they come up. If you can, use the cash flow forecasting tools available in your software to anticipate and manage any business income fluctuations effectively and finally, maintain meticulous records by uploading copies of your invoices and receipts as soon as you can after receiving them.
Financial tasks to keep on top of monthly
Rachel advises dedicating time each month to handle key financial tasks vital for your business's success. Begin by ensuring that your staff payroll records are kept up to date and that payroll processing runs smoothly. Next, dive into your profit and loss statement, meticulously analyzing your annual and ongoing turnover while setting aside funds for taxes. Take a moment to compare your margins and expenses to previous months and your budget projections, giving you a clear picture of your financial trajectory. Remember to prioritize your own financial well-being by paying yourself appropriately. Additionally, conduct a comprehensive review of your balance sheet, including your director's loan account and any outstanding taxes owed to HMRC. This ensures your business remains compliant and financially stable, setting you on the path to long-term success.
Bonus financial activities to boost your wellbeing 
If you�re finding it easier to keep on top of your weekly and monthly financial tasks, Rachel recommends improving your financial management practices even further with simple yet effective tasks that boost efficiency and forward thinking. Start by regularly reviewing your expenses and direct debits to ensure they're in line with your business goals, helping you make smarter financial decisions. Keep track of upcoming payments and renewals to avoid missing deadlines and seize opportunities to save money. Take a proactive approach to saving by setting aside a portion of your earnings each month for anticipated yearly expenses, helping you avoid financial stress during busy periods.
Lastly, make sure your business runs smoothly by planning ahead for the replacement of essential assets. By incorporating these easy-to-implement tasks into your financial routine, you'll strengthen your financial foundation and set the stage for steady growth.
�To me, financial wellbeing (much like our physical or mental wellbeing) is not somewhere you arrive, but a state,� Rachel concludes. �A state of feeling comfortable, confident and happy with your finances. It doesn�t mean you have millions in the bank, nor does it mean you have a perfect money mindset, but it�s an improvement to the way you feel about [money].�

In the cases of Xerox and Apple, it�s obvious that innovators who aren�t applicators can get left behind.

Though innovation can be a major driver of success, overall, those who learn to apply new ideas may be able to achieve a better top line than those who stick to their old ways.

I find myself operating in the world of investment, where ROI is king. Because I�ve learned how to apply creative financing techniques that have already existed for hundreds of years to my businesses, I�ve had a world of opportunity open to me that most investors and entrepreneurs can only dream of.

This can be the possibility for any business owner who is not only willing to learn, but also to apply new ideas that challenge the �traditional way� of doing business�especially those who believe their options are limited by traditional financial constraints.
Challenging The Status Quo
The traditional path to investment, especially in real estate, has long been paved by bank loans and significant personal capital. This means that only those with a significant upfront payment and strong credit scores could hope to even throw their hat in the ring.

However, this conventional route isn�t the only way, and I�ll argue that it�s not even the safest or smartest way to get started for some. By challenging the status quo and embracing �unconventional methods,� investors can uncover avenues previously thought inaccessible.

The Power Of Perspective
The key to unlocking your potential and the potential earnings of your business lies in perspective. Your perspective influences your outcome. When investors shift their focus from ""what is"" to ""what could be,"" they discover possibilities they haven�t even thought were possible before. This mindset change is critical for recognizing and capitalizing on opportunities that others might overlook.


I�ve used a variety of nontraditional funding methods�like seller financing and private money lending�that bypass the need for traditional bank loans or large down payments.
Investing In Your Perspective
I am one of literally a dozen kids.
When your parents make a living but aren�t millionaires, finding housing for 14 people can be challenging. My dad learned about creative financing and used it to his advantage to house our family. He saw creative financing as an investment in his family.
Now, I see creative financing as an investment in my family too, but I also see it for the potential it has to help my family have a better financial future. In tandem with my father�s perspective, I�ve used nontraditional financing techniques to change my career path and my income and hopefully change the lives of entrepreneurs everywhere.
Breaking Barriers To Entry
One of the most significant advantages of creative financing is its ability to lower the barriers to entry for new investors. Traditional investment routes often require substantial capital, which is not just a deterrent to the hesitant and skeptical, but also an insurmountable obstacle for some. Some creative financing strategies, on the other hand, can provide pathways to investment with minimal or even no initial capital requirement.
A New Era Of Inclusivity
The investment landscape can become more inclusive with nontraditional financing techniques like seller financing and subject to agreements.
Strategies like these can open doors for individuals who have the acumen and ambition but lack the financial means to embark on investment ventures through conventional routes. This inclusivity not only benefits individual investors but can also contribute to a more diverse and dynamic market.
Who Can Benefit And Where To Start
The landscape of investment is not just evolving; it's undergoing a revolution that�s calling for a new breed of investors�those who don't just adapt to change but drive it.
And this revolution isn�t reserved for a select few, either. It's accessible to all entrepreneurs willing to embrace the journey of continuous learning and diligent application, and the doors are open for anyone prepared to invest time and effort into understanding its intricacies.
But it's about more than just learning the ropes of unconventional financing methods. It�s about cultivating a mindset that sees beyond limitations and perceives opportunities where others see barriers.
Now, entrepreneurs looking to explore creative financing need to start by thoroughly understanding their own financial situation, goals and needs. To help you determine how you as an individual can get started, you can ask yourself questions like:
� How much funding do I need to meet my long-term goal?
� How comfortable am I with identifying and managing risks?
� Do I fully understand the creative financing model, or do I need to build a team to help me accomplish my goals?
Most challenges in creative financing come from navigating the complexity of new financial tools rather than understanding them in concept. Adhering to regulatory and compliance requirements and managing the potential impact on business operations is hard for many small businesses to do on their own.
While it's possible to start using creative financing to pursue success, no one man is a master of all. Preparation for success means educating yourself about methods, seeking advice from financial experts, staying informed about market and regulatory changes, and building a team to help manage all of these things
Creative financing offers more flexibility and potentially quicker access to funds than traditional methods when you understand how to mitigate risks. People who want to utilize creative financing can mitigate risks by doing their due diligence and research to make sure that the long-term financial flow is a net positive, not just in the short term. People may be at risk if they do not use every proper contract and precaution, which can lead to legal trouble. To avoid both of these risks, consider working with a transaction coordinator whose entire job it is to guide you through the right steps.
As you reflect upon your own business practices, consider that the path to success is no longer linear. The future of investment is not just about where you're going and the returns you receive, but also about how you choose to get there.

Business,190,How Ditching Checks Can Reshape Finance For Small Businesses,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2024/02/27/how-ditching-checks-can-reshape-finance-for-small-businesses/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/616ecfb38ace5c9943252b6e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,27-02-24,"Regardless of the industry, managing finances poses challenges, but adopting digital payment solutions can streamline processes.",How Ditching Checks Can Reshape Finance For Small Businesses,"Digital payments have taken over our personal lives, but many businesses still rely on old-fashioned paper checks despite their often being slower and costlier. There are some perceived advantages to paying by check. Some businesses appreciate the reliability of the check system and find comfort in its familiarity; old habits die hard. Also, writing checks gives businesses a perceived sense of control over their cash flow. But the statistics tell a different story.

Check usage is decreasing, with only 45% of Americans using them in 2022. Australia also plans to stop using checks by 2030, aiming to improve efficiency and regulation through digital payments. Regardless of the industry, managing finances poses challenges, but adopting digital payment solutions can streamline processes, ushering in a new era of efficiency and effectiveness in businesses� financial management. It�s time to break free from old habits and adapt to evolving digital payment trends.


Why Saying Goodbye To Checks Works Wonders
Faster Transactions
Digital payments speed up financial transactions, ensuring faster payment processing. Unlike the slow process of handling paper checks, businesses become more efficient with the rapid pace of digital transactions. Checks usually take three to 10 days, making business owners wait a long time to get paid. In contrast, digital payment options like instant payments and same-day ACH transfers only take a few seconds to a few days, making the payment process much faster.


Streamlined Cash Flow
Effective cash flow management relies on predictability. Digital payments remove the uncertainty linked to check clearance times, offering businesses a smoother and more predictable cash flow. A significant 82% of small and medium-sized businesses report altering their payment methods for improved efficiency in sending or receiving payments. Digitizing accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) processes improves cash flow management, making it easier for business owners to run their operations smoothly.

Security First
Modern payment solutions take security seriously, using strong measures to lower the risks of check fraud and create a safe place for financial transactions. Shockingly, reported cases of possible check fraud went up from 350,000 in 2021 to 680,000 in 2022. Paper checks can be stolen or lost, causing potential problems for financial management.


The increase in check fraud cases shows how checks are not the safest option. They can be easily taken or misplaced, leading to financial issues for businesses. Going for digital payments is a smarter and more secure choice in today�s digital world. It not only protects businesses from the growing risk of check fraud but also makes sure their financial systems stay safe and up to date.
Customer-Friendly Payments
Digital payments bring a big advantage�flexibility in how customers pay. Saying goodbye to checks means businesses can offer various payment methods, giving customers the convenience and choices they love. For businesses looking to receive payments quickly or send bill payments ahead of time, having options like instant payments and same-day ACH transfers becomes essential. It�s all about making the payment experience smooth and flexible for both businesses and their customers.
Real-Time Tracking
Paper checks stand as a barrier to efficient financial management. Unlike digital payments, checks lack the immediacy needed for informed decision-making in business. Digital transactions offer real-time visibility, allowing businesses to track their financial well-being and strategize effectively�something checks simply can�t match. With online payments, control over fund transfers is at your fingertips, and the entire process is traceable. This transparency not only supports effective cash flow management but also eliminates the uncertainties tied to check processing times and outstanding payments.
Effortless Automatic Reconciliation
Digital payment solutions effortlessly integrate with accounting systems, automating the reconciliation process. This not only saves valuable time but guarantees precise financial records. Manual reconciliation tasks are time-consuming, causing significant delays for the AP and AR teams. The automation of this process not only saves time but also streamlines the workflow, allowing teams to focus on more strategic and impactful aspects of financial management.
Error-Free Finances
Handling paper checks is time-consuming and error-prone, involving matching payments with invoices and manual data entry. Don�t even get started on sorting out payment disputes�it�s a headache! This increases the risk of errors, impacting cash flow and customer experience. Digital payments streamline and automate these tasks, saving time and resources previously spent on manual corrections.
Welcoming A Check-Free Tomorrow
The transition from checks to digital payments isn�t merely a trend; it�s a strategic move toward a future of efficient and effective financial management for small businesses. As we stand on the brink of a check-free future, small businesses have a choice to make�adopt the efficiency and advantages of digital payments or linger in the outdated practices of the past. The decline in check usage is a clear signal that the financial landscape is evolving, and those who adapt stand to reap the benefits of streamlined processes, improved security and a brighter, more sustainable financial future.

Business,191,2024 And Beyond: Digital Transformation Trends And The Finance Function,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/01/2024-and-beyond-digital-transformation-trends-and-the-finance-function/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e0db35e5e2b299722586c2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,28-02-24,"While digital transformation is necessary, it is particularly beneficial for finance, which gains efficiency in transactional and decision-making processes.",2024 And Beyond: Digital Transformation Trends And The Finance Function,"The challenge of digital transformation is more vital than ever. Indeed, to assimilate the various changes underway while remaining resilient in the face of one crisis after another, new technologies represent a significant reinforcement for companies to:

� Comply more easily with regulatory requirements.

� Enhance their operational efficiency.


� Facilitate decision-making.
While digital transformation is necessary, it is particularly beneficial for the finance function, which gains efficiency in transactional processes�the vast majority of which can be automated�and decision-making processes, facilitated by the exhaustive exploitation of data, rich in insights into customer behavior and market fluctuations.
From embedded finance and open banking to decentralized finance (DeFi) and generative AI, I will explore the five crucial trends for financial management in 2024.
1. The Rise Of AI In Finance

The exceptional progress made in AI, particularly in generative AI solutions, has enabled AI-powered tools to become so widely available that they have profoundly transformed many businesses and markets. With the rise of AI, finance teams will be empowered to save time on several fronts, including

� The automation of repetitive tasks.
� Mass data analysis and analytics.


� Cash flow and risk prevention with greater precision.
The predictive power of AI makes it a potent tool for finance teams. Indeed, when there has never been so much data available, and demand for prediction is on the rise, AI represents an opportunity to increase predictive capabilities while improving the reliability of projected scenarios.
Many use cases are still at the experimental stage, but some applications are already having a decisive impact on the financial processes of companies.
In 2024, it will be a matter of deploying AI with practical use cases for businesses and not just for the trend. A study conducted by KPMG in 2023, for example, showed that 59% of finance managers at companies with sales of over $1 billion were already using AI tools in their tax or financial processes.
2. Standardizing The Use Of The Cloud To Optimize Embedded Finance
The cloud is a key player in businesses' digital transformation.
By making data accessible in a unified way, anytime and anywhere, the cloud is moving toward automating transaction processes. ?Real-time data updates foster team collaboration and improve companies' visibility of both financial and non-financial information. Last but not least, the high adaptability of cloud technology means that IT costs can be better adjusted.
Indeed, cloud offers are flexible, making it easy to increase or reduce allocated resources according to business needs. As KPMG points out, the cloud can be important in optimizing embedded finance.
Embedded finance means integrating financial services into non-financial platforms and applications, blurring the lines between traditional banking and everyday activities. In 2024, anticipate a surge in embedded finance solutions across various sectors, including e-commerce, ride-sharing and healthcare.
By embedding financial services seamlessly into existing platforms, businesses can enhance customer engagement, streamline transactions and unlock new revenue streams, driving greater innovation and accessibility.
3. Keeping Up The Blockchain Momentum To Look Toward DeFi
Although blockchain technologies are particularly popular with FinTechs, their use is still restricted to certain players. Yet the possibilities offered by blockchain make it a particularly effective tool for:
� Immediate and infallible authentication of a security or certificate, as well as its provenance.
� Traceability of all elements recorded on it.
� Secure transfer of assets.

?This self-regulating, tamper-proof environment, open to all, represents a trusted, low-cost solution, expediating audits or accounting exercises free from error or fraudulent manipulation. For these reasons, blockchain is a reliable way of increasing tax efficiency while reducing tax-collection costs and meeting cybersecurity challenges.
But what's more interesting for 2024 is DeFi, which represents a paradigm shift in traditional banking and finance. Built on blockchain technology, DeFi platforms offer financial services including lending, borrowing and trading, without intermediaries. In 2024, DeFi should gain further traction, fueled by growing interest from both institutional investors and retail users.
As regulatory frameworks evolve to accommodate this burgeoning sector, DeFi has the potential to democratize access to financial services on a global scale.
4. Modernizing Financial Tools With Open Banking ?
Developments in the banking sector, notably the 2015 adoption of the Payment Services Directive (PSD2), have recently led to the emergence of the open banking system. Thanks to standardized APIs, open banking allows the sharing of customer banking data with third-party services.
If open banking is presented as a sum of considerable advantages for customers, who now have access to personalized and more efficient services through the various APIs, it is also an asset for businesses.
Indeed, thanks to open banking, finance functions have new technological levers at their disposal, revolutionizing the financial landscape. Sharing banking information in real time opens up new opportunities for automating financial processes.
5. Building Future-Oriented FinOps Solutions
Automated financial operations, ?payments and reconciliation should continue to disrupt the finance and accounting function.
By linking platforms with customers' ERP and accounting information, financial processes can be more effectively centralized and automated, evacuating any need for manual data entry. With APIs, companies can launch payments directly from their accounting software or ERP system. The transaction is faster but still just as secure with the available information.?
Finally, modern digital tools enable invoices to be systematically reconciled in an error-free manner with their corresponding bank transactions. This makes the company's accounts much easier to manage while improving accuracy for finance teams.
Tech And Finance�Two Communicating Vessels
Tech trends can sometimes seem excessively complex to integrate, encouraging CFOs to adopt a conservative stance by focusing exclusively on their fundamentals.
Yet, competition will inevitably force all companies to adapt or suffer the advantages other players acquire. Therefore, continuous learning and innovation are the only options available for businesses to thrive in 2024.

Business,192,Is AI The Future Of Business Finance?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2023/12/16/is-ai-the-future-of-business-finance/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/657e32f232799ae65a4ed52d/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,16-12-23,"Let�s explore the benefits of AI in finance, its limitations, and its potential impact on the future of business finances.",Is AI The Future Of Business Finance?,"As technology rapidly advances, many business owners are wondering if artificial intelligence (AI) will replace traditional financial management practices. The idea of being able to manage finances and complete tax returns without the need for an accountant may be appealing to some, but can AI truly replace the expertise and knowledge of a human accountant?


Let�s explore the benefits of AI in finance, its limitations, and its potential impact on the future of business finances:
1. The benefits of AI in finance
AI has many benefits that can greatly improve financial management practices in businesses. It can quickly analyze large amounts of data and make accurate predictions based on that information.


AI can provide real-time reporting, reducing the time spent manually compiling reports. Automation of accounting processes, such as invoicing and financial statements, can also save time and reduce the risk of human error.

With AI handling these tasks, business owners can focus on more strategic decision-making and growth opportunities.

2. Limitations of AI in finance

While AI has many benefits, there are also limitations to its capabilities. For example, AI algorithms can only make predictions based on the data they have been provided, making it essential to thoroughly validate and verify data inputs.

AI lacks the human intuition and judgment that human accountants possess, making it difficult for AI to make complex decisions based on non-numerical data and subjective factors.
3. Impact on the future of business finances


AI has the potential to significantly impact the future of business finances. With automation and real-time reporting, business owners can make faster and more informed decisions. The results are increased efficiency and profitability for the business.
However, it is unlikely that AI will fully replace human accountants. Instead, AI will most likely be used to augment the work of accountants, allowing for more strategic decision-making and deeper insights. Human accountants can focus on providing high-value services such as strategy consultation, audit services, and business advisory work.
4. Risks and concerns
One concern is that AI could compromise data security and privacy by making confidential financial information more accessible to cybercriminals. It is essential to have proper cybersecurity measures in place to ensure data is secure and protected.
Another risk is job displacement. While it is unlikely that AI will fully replace accountants, it may replace some of the more repetitive and mundane accounting tasks. This could lead to job loss in those areas and require accountants to develop new skills and expertise to remain relevant in the workforce.
While AI has its advantages, it cannot replace human judgment and decision-making. The future of business finance services will involve a partnership between AI technology and human expertise. Business owners should embrace AI technology as a tool to improve efficiency and accuracy while preparing for the future by investing in AI. By doing so, you will remain competitive in the market and stay ahead of technological changes.
The bottom line is that AI is a game-changer in the finance game, with a range of benefits that leverage several areas in the market. The future of business finances will certainly lean toward integrating AI into the financial management of companies. By doing so, business owners can optimize expertise, maximize efficiency, and achieve more informed and strategic decision-making in the industry.
As much as AI is bound to influence and control aspects of financial management, the expertise of human accountants remains a valuable asset that must not be neglected or ignored. The perfect blend of both AI and human expertise can create a futuristic and sustainable business environment."
Business,193,Embedded Finance Is The Minimum Standard For Modern Companies,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2024/02/26/embedded-finance-is-the-minimum-standard-for-modern-companies/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/630d25cef7ce17a751bf73ad/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,26-02-24,"The move to embedded finance can be a major boost, and using the connectivity now provided by APIs can actually improve companies� bottom line.",Embedded Finance Is The Minimum Standard For Modern Companies,"It�s easy to think of embedded finance as a bit of a techy buzz phrase, but in reality, it is something that affects each and every one of us every day. As consumers, we expect things to be seamless and to just work, and embedded finance has become that minimum service level for customer-business interaction.

For any customer-focused company, it is imperative to do away with a clunky website that requires its customers to leave the environment to process financial transactions. The move to embedded finance can be a major boost, and using the connectivity now provided by APIs can actually improve companies� bottom line.


What Is Embedded Finance?
Embedded finance isn�t a new technology by any means. It has, in fact, been around for a while. But the increasing availability of API connectivity means that including finance aspects into a consumer interaction is now possible for businesses large and small.

At its most simplistic, embedded finance is the completion of a transaction, with the seamless inclusion of a finance aspect from within the same platform.
The most obvious online example is when you buy from a seller on their website without being redirected to an entirely different payment website.

But it can also mean including a finance product as an upsell or cross-sell for an initial purchase. A good example here may be buying a car online and being able to buy insurance, breakdown cover and an extended warranty all at the same time and in the same place.

Businesses That Don�t Embed Are Missing Out
How you ask? There are two answers here.


The first is that for any customer-focused business, giving people the best user experience must be paramount. As consumers, we expect to be able to do most things online, and in the post-pandemic world, we can do much more than we ever thought possible. Embedded finance helps customers to complete their journeys with maximum speed and minimum fuss.
The second answer is that embedding finance products that allow cross-selling can not only improve revenue but also increase customer retention and leave buyers happier with their purchase.
Ultimately, the more your customers can do on your site, the more likely they are to stay with you.
The Rise Of The Specialist
Over the past few years, we�ve seen a general rise in the number of companies that are tightly focused around providing one service to the best of their ability, and there is good reason for this. Years ago, I remember the obvious concern with using specialist services was that managing all of the different connections between systems was a nightmare.
But as the U.K. rolls out open banking and the online world adopts the security of API connectivity, the opportunity for seamless integration using common standards means that this is no longer an issue.
Specialists aim to provide the ultimate quality in what they do without trying to be a jack-of-all-trades. This naturally means that businesses that choose to partner with a specialist get the best systems embedded within their own platforms almost as though they had developed the service themselves.
The big benefit of APIs is they are widely understood and development is much simpler than trying to sync up two systems old-school style.
Making The Move To Embedded Finance
The first port of call has to be thinking about what you want to achieve.
Once you have the strategic aims in place, you can start to look for best-in-class providers that will be able to offer the individual services you need that have the quality your customers demand.
Having the best provider for each type of service will ensure that your customers will be better served, but embedding these means they will probably never know these services aren�t native to your company. Among the options are a whole host of providers, regulated and compliant per U.K. law, or one of many high street banks.
Seek recommendations from peers within your industry, and ask potential vendors to provide credible case studies showing how they have made a difference in the past.
The Online Future Is Embedded
The truth is that businesses with an online sales presence that have already adopted an embedded approach will be better placed to service their customers� needs and will likely have a lower abandonment rate and better customer retention.
We all know that customers place a value on convenience, and if they have had a simple, successful and seamless experience with your company in the past, then they will likely return and may also recommend you to others, too.

Business,194,New Lab Launches To Shift Finance Focus To Just Transition,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amynguyen/2024/02/28/new-lab-launches-to-shift-finance-focus-to-just-transition/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ddc869a89f0aa722b3ca0f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,28-02-24,"Through innovative research, stakeholder engagement, advocacy and testing solutions, the Just Transition Finance Lab will advance the principles of the just transition.",New Lab Launches To Shift Finance Focus To Just Transition,"As it stands, the vast majority of financing decisions for climate action do not explicitly consider the social opportunities, risks or dialogue needed to ensure success. That�s what the Just Transition Finance Lab sets out to alter following its launch in London on February 20th.


Formed by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the LSE, the Lab seeks to bring the just transition to life through research, advocacy, stakeholder engagement and designing and testing solutions to embed within organisations.

�Given the scale of the climate crisis and need for rapid action, we now need to move from promising early signals to the transformation of the nearly $500 trillion global financial system for the just transition.�, shared Nick Robins, executive director of the Just Transition Finance Lab. 


The International Labour Organisation (ILO) unpacks the just transition as a scenario where social and economic opportunities of climate and environmental action can be maximised. Achieving this all whilst minimising and carefully managing challenges through effective social dialogue, stakeholder engagement and stewardship of the fundamental principles and rights at work.

Whilst social indicators may be somewhat integrated into existing approaches for financing climate action, the Lab will focus on innovation around critical leverage points to drive exponential change. Doing so will be key to unlocking social advancement to ensure a shift to a green economy encompasses better jobs, gender equality, community renewal and universal access to key commodities.
Following the agreement made by countries at COP28 to triple renewables and double energy efficiency, the immediate need for financing is clear. In its �Financing a just transition� report, the Lab�s team write that, �There is a historic opportunity to make sure that the clean energy expansion produces decent work, with social dialogue, shared value for communities, and universal access to clean energy for the 2.3 billion consumers without access to clean cooking and the 760 million without clean electricity.�

The Lab has four main priorities. This includes designing and deploying financial instruments and strategies as well as establishing effective metrics to measure performance and impact on advancing a just transition. Not only this, but it will work to identify and achieve necessary policy reforms and stimulate breakthrough innovations with best-in-class case studies.


This work builds on the foundations of the Investing in a Just Transition Initiative borne in 2018 as well as the Banking on a Just Transition project and plays into wider conversations about the role of finance and asset allocation in facilitating and funding climate adaption and mitigation strategies.
Embedding a just transition into net zero strategies
The appetite for change is there, especially as net zero economies, like the U.K.�s continue to grow. Robins recounted that �We've experienced a real growth in strategic recognition from investors and banks that climate and nature progress simply won't be achieved without a focus on people. This has gone furthest in the area of shareholder engagement, as seen from the ClimateAction 100+ initiative.�
The Lab has already worked with Scottish energy company SSE to develop a just transition strategy, which is embedded into its wider net zero roadmap. For a company with a capitalisation of �17.7 billion as of January 2024, this is no small feat and has even brought the conversation of just transition into its annual general meeting (AGM). With the support of the Lab, SSE became the first organisation globally to have a dedicated just transition strategy set out over five aspects such as green bonds, consumer fairness and supporting communities with a subset of 20 principles.
After working on this with businesses, a logical next step is to integrate just transition factors throughout financial decision-making, comments Robins. He assesses where the entry point could be, �The appetite for this is strongest in terms of net zero planning where banks, investors and corporates are starting to show they are managing the social risks and opportunities for workers, communities, suppliers and consumers, and crucially how they are involving them in the process of change.�
What are the obstacles standing in the way of financing a just transition?
What stands in the way of progress on financing the just transition? The Lab outlines a handful of systemic challenges and leverage points on how to address them.Source: The Just Transition: Transforming the financial system to deliver action � Just Transition ... [+] Finance Lab, 2024Credit: Just Transition Finance Lab 
Are some obstacles more prevalent than others? �We see a set of interlocking obstacles holding back progress on the just transition. Linking them together is the overarching need for a shift in mentality for social factors to become absolutely intrinsic to climate policymaking, corporate climate action as well as the financing that underpins both.�, noted Robins. He calls out the need for braver and bolder leaders who are willing to break with finance and business as usual to traverse this space.
Place-based context is a priority for the just transition
Place-based context and a localised approach is fundamental to a just transition as each geography has its own nuances, be that related to the level of economic growth derived from fossil fuel industries or the development of social labour laws enshrined in the workplace.
The focus for the Lab will initially be on two countries, the U.K. and India. For the U.K., efforts will centre around place based just transition investment plans. Whereas in India, the Lab will link with partners to develop sustainable finance innovations that support a just transition to achieve the country�s 2070 net zero target.
Social justice is at the heart of a just transition which the Lab recognises as a key pillar. Most often, creating the social conditions for workers in the Global South dispersed across supply chains to thrive, remain ignored or fall as a lower priority than other �sustainability� indicators, especially environmental ones.
Robins believes that the real test of the just transition will be in the Global South. �It has less than 4% of global assets, yet the biggest investment needs for climate and nature and the most profound social challenges to be faced, along with the greatest social opportunities�, he noted.
Continuing, Robins outlined that finance should focus on the needs of vulnerable workers in supply chains and also tailor financial solutions for SMEs and communities. He added that �The Global North has a lot to learn from developing countries in how green transitions can be done with social uplift.""
How to mobilise global debt markets for a just transition?
Another opportunity to encourage the take up of the just transition is in the green, social, sustainable and sustainability linked bond and loan market amongst sovereign, multinational, multi-lateral development banks and corporate issuers. That�s why, the LSE teamed up with the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) in the Autumn of 2023 to identify and promote the role of bond issuance to drive a just and inclusive transition to net zero across the globe.
The partnership looks specifically at the needs and demands for bond instruments to support a just transition and developing the type of bond strategies that could be used to achieve greater impact. Together, they are exploring its application in different geographies such as the U.K., Central Europe, India, Indonesia and South Africa to promote issuance. At COP28, the LSE and CBI released a report on mobilising global debt markets for a just transition which estimated that there could be already $548 billion of bonds which are relevant for the energy transition.
Robins set out the ideas for the next phase of this partnership. �We want to bring key bond market actors together to understand the barriers and identify solutions. We are not predetermining the outcome - we're interested in green bonds which could support workforce and community development, sustainable bonds which could channel investment to both the environmental and social pillars of the just transition, as well as sustainability-linked products where just transition becomes a KPI.�, he shared.
Just Energy Transition Partnerships facilitate initial financing to Global South
The mission of the Lab is complimented by developments in recent years, including the formation of Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) which emerged for the first time at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021.
In their infancy, JETPs are a financing cooperation to coordinate resources and technical assistance from the Global North to recipient countries most vulnerable to climate change. The aim is to do so in a way that helps to address social consequences of the transition with the support of training, alternative job creation and new economic opportunities.
As a mechanism they stand to support the mobilisation of the $100 billion attributed to the Global North�s climate bill and climate financing, a somewhat broken promise has yet to be realised in full, having been agreed in 2022 at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt.
The first of its kind came in 2021, when South Africa was promised $8.5 billion in financing by France, Germany, the U.K., the U.S. as well as the European Union. Since then, countries including India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Senegal have all been beneficiaries of JETPs. For example, at the G20 Leaders' Summit in Bali in November 2022, Indonesia's JETP deal was announced with $20 billion in finance to be allocated over 3 to 5 years. Such efforts stand to show that capital is being mobilised to finance the just transition but, not at the speed necessary.
Making the just transition a bipartisan issue
How can we vote, advocate for and advance a just transition? As of October 2022, the ILO notes that only 49 countries have committed to placing employment at the heart of ambitious climate action and to promoting a just transition, whilst 65 of the 170 countries that submitted updated NDCs included references to a just transition.
With 2024, being a historic super election year as 64 countries head to the polls, what are the best-in-class examples of policy reform and implementation that Robins and his team have come across? �The fairness of the transition is a major political issue in country after country�, he said, recounting that �We're already witnessing policy responses in a range of jurisdictions including the labour and community provisions of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, Spain's just transition programme for coal, the wider EU just transition mechanism for carbon intensive regions as well as the JETP in South Africa.�
Robins adheres that it is crucial for the just transition to become a bipartisan issue so that policymakers at any point on the political spectrum can work to understand the hopes and fears of their people in terms of climate action. �Then, it�s the role of finance to allocate the capital at scale to where it�s needed to reduce climate loss and damage and realise the huge human potential of climate action�, he finalised."
Business,195,How Alternative Finance Is Reimagining Credit,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2024/02/23/how-alternative-finance-is-reimagining-credit/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65a16a750352a458d74fec59/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,23-02-24,Alternative financiers have distinct characteristics that allow them to offer more flexible lines of credit.,How Alternative Finance Is Reimagining Credit,"Credit is a cornerstone for businesses�influencing their ability to make purchases and achieve financial goals. Any business with serious intent to grow must actively manage its established lines of credit, understand additional options and have plans for optimizing its credit when scaling up.

In the past, a business�s credit options were limited to the banks with which it held accounts. Bank credit is, by nature, slow, inflexible and stringent due to the regulatory background and resistance to risk that drives established finance. Alternative financiers have distinct characteristics that allow them to offer more flexible lines of credit, which businesses can leverage for greater agility and sustainable growth.


What Is Alternative Finance?
Alternative finance is a wide-ranging term in the financial industry for any non-bank entity that engages in lending or investing. In practice, alternative financiers are typically more technologically savvy and less risk-averse. They are often motivated to connect people who are underserved by traditional banks with the funds they need.

This sector is still in its adolescence, and in previous years, the typical alternative financier only offered short-term loans with little variety. In recent years, the industry has been flush with innovation. One service that has evolved is the line of credit.
How Lines Of Credit Are Changing With Alternative Finance
At its most basic level, a line of credit is a simple agreement in which a lender provides funds up to a predetermined limit and the business pays interest on the rolling amount of money borrowed. Different variations include fixed or variable interest rate agreements, the use of collateral, repayment terms and minimum monthly payments.

Banks have traditionally used a business owner�s credit score to gauge the funding limit on a line of credit; however, alternative financiers have shied away from this practice, which can result in better service to their clients. For instance, a business owner can establish a line of credit with an alternative financing firm the same day by providing simple cash flow and account summary documents, which most business owners have easily available, in my experience.


Alternative financiers are typically more flexible than banks. For example, when I have a client who has arranged for multiple funding opportunities, I make it a point to offer a tailored line of credit based on the scale, term and interest rates that work for their business.
Alternative finance firms are also generally less risk-averse. As a result, the application and approval timelines are often significantly shorter with alternative financiers. Likewise, there may be multiple loan offerings with different collateral requirements available, which can be good for business owners at different stages of their growth path.
By taking a customer-centric approach and prioritizing flexibility, alternative financiers are reimagining lending for modern businesses and their needs.
Understanding Risks And Drawbacks
Of course, as in any financial service agreement, businesses must exercise caution and properly vet lending sources. Traditional banks have the advantage of a tight market with significant compliance and regulatory practice.
It�s essential to acknowledge the potential risks and drawbacks associated with these alternative avenues. Costs may be higher compared to traditional bank loans. While alternative finance providers may offer faster approval processes and more lenient eligibility criteria, they often do so at the expense of higher interest rates, fees or revenue-sharing arrangements. It�s important for businesses to carefully assess the total cost of borrowing to ensure it remains manageable and sustainable for their operations.
Another consideration is that alternative finance markets may face less regulation. While this can sometimes mean greater accessibility for businesses, it also increases the risk of encountering predatory lending practices or unclear terms and conditions. Without the oversight provided by traditional banking regulations, businesses may find themselves vulnerable to unexpected fees, unfavorable contract terms or disputes with alternative finance providers.
Therefore, while alternative finance options can offer flexibility and opportunities for businesses, it�s crucial to approach them with caution and conduct thorough due diligence to mitigate potential risks. However, alternative finance as an industry is undergoing a compliance overhaul, which is reducing the prevalence of bad actors.

But it may be especially challenging this year since there are so many innovations and potential changes in areas like community building, personalization, finances, marketing, technology, and more.

To help figure it out, I asked several small business experts to share their insights on 2024 trends to better prepare you to navigate our ever-evolving entrepreneurial world.

Small business trends for 2024

Building community
Businesses should make commitment to communities a strategic imperative in 2024

Businesses of all sizes will make fostering the growth of their local communities a top priority in 2024. It�s of strategic importance and can provide a competitive advantage. As businesses, we are all responsible for building stronger economies and more resilient communities.

Customer experience
Maintaining a strong brand identity and foothold within the market boils down to how you manage your customer relationships


The �customer is always right� mantra is one many business owners know, abide by, and incorporate into their company cultures. This is why in 2024 I predict businesses of all sizes will invest more in the customer experience to keep their clients happy and returning. Entrepreneurs will seek tools to help them go the extra mile for their customers. Businesses will invest in customer experience (CX) teams to ensure clients are happy from start to end and, most importantly, return for future and repeat business.
�Nellie Akalp, CEO, CorpNet
Personalization will be crucial for continuing to build client relationships
Managing the client flow process with a personalized touch from start to finish is crucial for success, continued growth, customer satisfaction, and retention. Ensuring clients feel cared for and their unique needs are met is a win-win for both independent workers and customers.
�Oz Alon, CEO, HoneyBook
The future of marketing is going to be incredibly personal
It�s not about a hard sell anymore�you need to create a memorable customer experience that makes [customers] feel a mutual connection to your business. And that gives them a reason to keep coming back for more.
In 2024, I expect small businesses to steer even further into this trend and truly put a personal touch on their marketing communications. They will learn new technologies and leverage them to understand their customers� experiences, preferences, and consumption habits to make them feel like the stars of the show. This approach will create a much more intimate and trusting relationship, ultimately leading to more clicks, opens, donations, followers, sales, and growth.
�Laura Goldberg, CMO, Constant Contact
Finances
Small businesses continue grappling with significant challenges impacting their growth and sustainability
According to insights recently gathered by Hello Alice, the struggle to secure capital or find accessible loans remains a pressing issue, with a substantial 31.4% of small business owners reporting this challenge. Moreover, the elevated rate of inflation poses a considerable hurdle for these businesses as well.
Unlike larger competitors, small businesses often lack the purchasing power to handle this escalating issue, facing a dual challenge: navigating inflation�s impact while competing in a market where larger counterparts possess greater financial leverage. This imbalance not only affects their day-to-day operations, but also restricts their ability to invest in critical areas such as innovation, technology, and expansion efforts necessary for long-term success. However, small business owners are resilient and the backbone of our economy, so they will make it through and lead us all into a stronger economy.
�Elizabeth Gore, President/Co-Founder, Hello Alice
How to weather a recession
We are seeing a steady reduction in inflation while employment levels remain strong. The Federal Reserve�s interest rate policy seems to be working, and it is reasonable to assume that inflation will continue to decline from current levels. Given these indicators, we expect the economy to achieve the �soft landing� the Fed has been targeting, which means that if there is a recession, it will be short and relatively minor for most.
Industries that would be most impacted by a down economy:
We expect transportation to be one of the hardest-hit sectors in an economic downturn. The long-haul trucking industry is already struggling as consumer spending has shifted away from goods and toward services in recent months. We also expect auto purchases to dip as financing costs have risen dramatically while used car values have declined. As a result, many car owners cannot afford to trade in their existing cars to purchase new ones.
What small businesses can do to prepare themselves financially for a potential recession in 2024?


 Small businesses should determine whether they will need capital in 2024 and, if so, work to secure it now. Banks have been reducing exposure to small businesses ever since the pandemic, and now, with higher interest rates putting pressure on bank deposits and greater regulatory scrutiny, banks are reducing their loan books even more. Fortunately, several small business lenders have been expanding their ability to provide small business capital in the face of this bank contraction. Small business owners should consider exploring options with their banks and non-bank lenders.
 Small businesses that streamline operations and leverage technology to do more work with less labor will be the best prepared to weather a recession. Many businesses are implementing self-service technologies or outsourcing customer service and accounting functions, allowing them to spend more time running daily operations. Small businesses that can reduce costs without sacrificing customer experience will be the biggest winners in 2024.
 Small businesses should be very judicious when reviewing new projects or plans for expansion. If the company chooses to expand, the unit economics of the expansion should be examined to understand how much it will cost to execute and what profits can be expected. The market must then be assessed to determine the volume of goods to be sold at these price points. Prices are set where the business owner believes that profits can be maximized while contributing an acceptable level of effort. If the economics appear marginal, the business owner will want to put a hold on expansion plans until the market improves.


�Ben Johnston, COO, Kapitus
Whatever the obstacle, small business owners get creative and find ways to problem-solve and grow their companies
Last year, according to our small business data, small businesses continued to show a true spirit of resiliency. A key finding from one of our recent small business owner surveys found that half of the companies surveyed agreed that cash flow management tool consolidation positively impacts profitability, and 71% said it positively impacts efficiency. Small business owners are now prioritizing their digital financial toolkits to improve their businesses. No matter the challenges, ongoing cash flow management is essential to effectively running a business.
This year, we anticipate cash flow management will remain paramount in day-to-day operations. The need to streamline management to unlock new efficiencies continues with the help of enhanced cash flow tools, including analytics, funding, and banking. Many (41%) of the small businesses surveyed in our inaugural Financial Confidence Report said they ""often"" or ""always"" turn down potential growth opportunities because they are unsure about their cash flow. There is a wide array of benefits for small businesses when it comes to consolidating cash flow management tools, and our data indicates the critical role it plays in helping small businesses garner additional revenue, time, and productivity in the new year.
�Brett Sussman, Vice President, Business Blueprint & Banking at American Express
Franchising
This will be a good year for franchising
There will be continued interest in franchise ownership, especially from people who want to change careers. That is nothing new, but ever since the pandemic, the need to do so has increased. Today�s employees want more control over their hours and their lives. And a good number of them want to continue working from home. So, look for more home-based franchise concepts to be developed to meet this need.
On the financing front, although the Fed will start loosening things up, don't expect small business loan interest rates to lower in a significant way in 2024. And new franchisees will still need to submit solid business plans and put down fairly generous down payments for loan approvals.
The franchise sectors that will be the strongest this year are food, fitness, and businesses that service the senior population.
Finally, franchise buyers need to do their homework. But they shouldn�t only focus on the numbers. Contacting and visiting franchisees in person must be top of mind for anyone serious about becoming a franchisee in 2024.

Creators and SMBs are going global
From the creator and sharing economies to e-commerce and traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, 2024 is the year SMBs go global. For businesses of all sizes, the mindset has largely shifted beyond the local neighborhood to the global digital economy. Some 79% of SMBs [have] cited selling across borders as a focus for their growth, and consumers are ready for it�72% said they�re comfortable buying from businesses in other countries.
Digital payments are transforming opportunities for SMBs to pay and be paid, making it possible to reach new audiences, easily accept secure payments, track and monitor spending, increase security and safety, improve efficiencies, and grow like never before. And with payment innovations allowing for access to earnings in real-time, making it convenient to receive consumer and B2B payments, getting paid has never been easier. Payment solutions like virtual cards also help SMBs with the cash flow, purchasing power, and expense management capabilities needed to thrive in today�s digital-first world.
In 2024, we expect small and micro businesses to benefit from increased digitization that speeds and protects payments, making expanding beyond geographical borders easier than ever before.

Marketing
Marketers must continue to innovate and stay ahead of the curve by examining how companies strategically utilize the tools at their fingertips
[Our] LocaliQ team identified three key 2024 marketing trends to help best connect with your audience and make an impression.


 AI is here to stay. Between ChatGPT, Google�s Search Generative Experience and Bard, and a whole host of other AI tools cropping up, it�s imperative to understand the right way to use AI to your advantage.
 Zero and first-party data will be critical. With upcoming changes to Google and iOS, companies must be more creative with tracking marketing. Building an email list, sending a survey, and creating a lead magnet are a few ways to collect zero and first-party data.
 New advertising and content formats will be an advantage. Diversify your strategy to reach customers in new ways, like trying short-form videos, testing OTT ads, and texting your customers to stand out from the competition.


�Chris Cho, President, LocaliQ, Digital Marketing Solutions, Gannett
Marketing leaders will face serious challenges to growing brand value and loyalty next year amid an economic rough patch and changing digital habits. SMBs will need to prioritize communication tools to combat adversity.
AI can only take marketers so far; personalization and connection will be critical in 2024. AI will improve performance in three significant ways: optimize media buys, improve dynamic customer journey mapping, and boost SEO performance.
�Tami Cannizzaro, CMO, Thryv
AI is not just a trend but a fundamental shift in how small and medium-sized businesses approach marketing
AI�s integration into marketing strategies marks a new era characterized by data-driven insights, creative innovation, and personalized customer experiences. SMBs and marketers will increasingly leverage AI to uncover hidden patterns and insights, and transform this data into innovative marketing strategies, necessitating a move to understand and actively engage with the data. The role of marketers will evolve, requiring a blend of analytical insight and creative thinking, setting their strategies apart in a highly competitive market.
With AI�s ability to process and interpret consumer data in real-time, marketing personalization will reach new heights. Our 2023 Holiday Report shows personalized emails have an 87% higher click-through rate. In 2024, we expect AI-driven personalization to emerge as a fundamental aspect of marketing strategies for small businesses. Marketers will harness the power of AI to deliver more intimate and connected customer experiences, fostering deeper customer engagement and loyalty.
�Michelle Taite, Global Chief Marketing Officer, Intuit Mailchimp
Solopreneurs
Independent businesses will continue to adopt and embrace innovative tech to augment their businesses
AI will not completely replace workers. Instead, in 2024, technologies like AI and automation will augment independent businesses and help them become more productive, giving back time to focus on doing what they love. According to a recent Visa report, 91% of businesses would consider adding automation and AI over the next 12 months to elevate their companies over their competitors.
The number of entrepreneurs leveraging passive income will continue to rise.
Independent workers are monetizing their knowledge and exploring diversified revenue streams, like affiliates and digital products, converting their service talent into a digital product to hustle and generate passive income.
�Oz Alon, CEO, HoneyBook
More technology will be built specifically for solo business owners to do more with less
We expect to see an increase in the number of solopreneurs and side hustles this year. In the U.S., 27.1 million small businesses are run by a single owner without employees. Building technology for solopreneurs is critical to their success as they�re forced to do more with fewer resources, and technology serves as their extra set of hands.
�Matt Feierstein, President, EverCommerce
Technology
SaaS companies will shift their focus to more inclusive technology with intuitive points of entry to cater to older business owners
This year, small business-focused technology companies will focus on products that meet older business owners where they are. Generation X and baby boomers made up 86.8% of all small business owners in 2023. Older generations didn�t grow up with the technology that younger business owners are accustomed to�and today�s SaaS platforms will need to include business owners who are slower tech adopters to provide more opportunities and access to new solutions.
�Matt Feierstein, President, EverCommerce
SMBs embrace AI and scale back on SaaS providers
The euphoria of AI will start to fade as focus shifts to efficiency: As we brush off the newness of AI and automation, companies will begin to phase out of the trial period and start adopting helpful tools and solutions that create meaningful improvements across the front end and back office.
Tentativeness in the market will begin to ease. Coming out of today�s volatile economy and the increases in the cost of capital, SMBs will start to invest more across the tech sector, with a large focus on manufacturing advances across the supply chain.
SMBs are leveling up by scaling back on SaaS providers; if they already haven�t, most small businesses will migrate to become digital natives. To reduce costs and increase productivity from a management perspective, companies will seek to limit SaaS providers and target partners that offer multiple solutions on one platform.
�Aparna Khurjekar, Head of Small Business, Verizon Business
Change is the only constant in the small business landscape
2024 is sure to bring new challenges and opportunities for business owners. Despite the uncertainty, specific trends will continue to impact the small business landscape, including the proliferation of technology into small business operations.
According to Bank of America�s 2023 Small Business Owner Report, 80% of business owners digitally optimized their businesses in the prior year. I expect entrepreneurs to continue integrating new technologies into their companies in 2024. Whether it�s artificial intelligence to streamline payroll and bookkeeping, or augmented reality to provide customers with a more immersive experience, entrepreneurs� continued embrace of technology will help them save time, stay organized, and reach new audiences as they grow their businesses in 2024.
�Sharon Miller, President of Small Business and Head of Specialty Banking & Lending, Bank of America
Generative AI will transform SMBs
Across various domains, such as climate change, healthcare, education, and transportation, organizations of different scales are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to address intricate global issues. To successfully harness this power, companies must commit to providing inclusive access to generative AI, a technology I consider to be the most transformative of our era.
To see impact, cutting-edge technology must become more readily accessible, allowing for more opportunities to leverage these tools to make a positive impact on the world�which is specifically relevant for SMBs. By integrating AI into their operations across diverse industries and geographies, I firmly believe that SMBs can leverage advanced technologies like AI to address some of our most pressing societal challenges in 2024 and beyond.

Despite coming around only every four years, the date has importance in baseball's financial history.",February 29 Has Been A Rare Yet Interesting Date In Baseball Finance,"Welcome to February 29, the day that occurs every Leap Year. For precocious prospects Jackson Holliday of the Baltimore Orioles or Jackson Chourio of the Milwaukee Brewers, this is only the sixth time they have experienced the date. So it is �rare� for them at ages 20 and 19, respectively.

Still, the date has importance in the financial history of baseball

Since the first Major League game was played in 1876, a total of 23,114 men have made at least one appearance. Only 16 of them were born on February 29. Two of those were among the game's finest � Pepper Martin of the St. Louis Cardinals and Al Rosen of the Cleveland Indians.


Martin was part of the legendary Gashouse Gang. That talented group of wild and crazy guys helped St. Louis rule the National League in the 1930s. In a 13-year career, Martin batted over .300 six times, was a four-time All-Star and led the NL in stolen bases three times. Despite being wildly popular, his top salary was a reported $9,000 in 1934, which equates to $209,145 today. The MLB minimum for 2024 is $740,000.

Rosen was a slugger for 10 years (1947-56) in Cleveland. He missed four years due to World War II, then hit well over .300 with power in the minors. He did not become a regular until 1950. All-Star Ken Keltner held the Indians' third-base job until then.
Over the next five years, Rosen averaged 31 homers, 114 RBI, a .298 average -- and won the 1953 American League Most Valuable Player Award.
Despite that, Cleveland cut his $42,500 salary ($478,934 today) to $37,500 ($425,078 today) for 1955. A broken finger that did not heal properly and back injury from an auto accident curtailed his production in 1955-56. He retired at age 32.

Rosen later was team president of the New York Yankees (1978-79), Houston Astros (1980-85) and San Francisco Giants (1985-92).
Big Bucks 60 Years Apart

Economics sure has changed over the years. Nothing underscores this more than two financial transactions that occurred in Cleveland on Feb. 29.
On that date in 1956, the Indians were sold to a group that included Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg. The former Detroit Tigers slugger had become general manager of the Indians, a club two years removed from a 111-win season and which finished second in 1955 with 93 wins. Attendance was great.

The roster was loaded. Hall of Famers Bob Feller, Early Wynn and Bob Lemon led a pitching staff that included rising star Herb Score. Hall of Famer Larry Doby and Rosen led the offense. Future fan-favorite slugger Rocky Colavito was a rookie.
And for all of that, Greenberg's group paid a whopping $4 million for the franchise.
Fast forward to Feb. 29, 2016, in Cleveland where ownership opened the purse strings for a different $4 million payout. It all went to 37-year-old infielder Juan Uribe. He hit .206 in 73 games and retired.
Big Money � At The Time
On Feb. 29, 1972, the great Henry Aaron became the first MLB player to sign a contract for $200,000. Hammering Hank was 38 years old, had already hit 683 homers and was chasing Babe Ruth's cherished long-ball record of 714.WEST PALM BEACH, FL:  Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves takes batting practice at Spring Training on ... [+] March 5, 1972.  
The sum of money was something that Aaron never imagined when he was a 20-year-old rookie in 1954 and made $6,000. For his 23-year career through 1976, he was paid about $2.1 million total according to Baseball-Reference.com estimates.
For those wondering, Joe DiMaggio got the first $100,000 contract, with the New York Yankees in 1950. That means it took 22 years for the game's top salary to double.
Fast forward another 22 years to 1994. Bobby Bonilla of the New York Mets was the game's highest-paid player � at $6,300,000 a season � an astronomical 3050% increase.
Add another 22 years to 2016 and the game's richest deal for that year belonged to Los Angeles Dodgers' ace Clayton Kershaw at $32 million � an increase of another 407.9%.
By 2038, the top contract may be as mind-boggling to baseball fans then as those increases are to us today. Mind-boggling by leaps."
Business,198,Why Organizations Should Care About Their Employees Finances,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2024/02/23/why-organizations-should-care-about-their-employees-finances/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d7a8dd9f4c68779aa73888/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,23-02-24,Investing in your employees� financial health is not just a moral imperative; it�s a strategic business decision that fosters a thriving and dedicated workforce.,Why Organizations Should Care About Their Employees Finances,"Financial stress has grown significantly over the past couple of years, with financial stability quickly becoming a major cause of stress for individuals. Escalating inflation and a rising cost of living have outpaced increases in most employees� salaries; leaving them grappling with mounting stress. Consequently, this heightened financial stress has far-reaching implications, negatively impacting the bottom line of numerous organizations.

In a recent Forbes article, it was highlighted that 70% of millennials find themselves living paycheck to paycheck. As millennials make up a growing portion of the workforce, it becomes increasingly imperative for employers to proactively address their employee�s financial concerns and support them in attaining financial stability. By providing opportunities for employees to effectively manage their financial concerns, and by offering resources aimed at easing these pressures, employers have the opportunity to boost productivity and strengthen employee loyalty.


Benefits
Employees accomplishing their financial goals with the support of their employer fosters deeper connections, enhances loyalty, boosts engagement and builds trust in the organization�s leadership.

In addition, the support leads to increased productivity with employees focusing less on their financial worries. In an era of high turnover rates, cultivating employee loyalty and dedication is more crucial than ever. When employees feel their personal goals are valued, it instills confidence and deepens their commitment to the organization.

Impacts
Productivity has been falling at the fastest rate since 1983, paralleling an all-time high in financial stress. Canadian businesses are losing billions due to repercussions of employees' financial worries, as noted by the Canadian HR Reporter: ""With ongoing labor shortages, a business must ensure that the employees they already have on payroll are focused and engaged.""

The impacts of employee financial stress are multifaceted, manifesting in:
� An increased number of sick days.


� Diminished engagement and morale.
� Higher levels of frustration affecting interoffice dynamics.
� A decline in focus and motivation.
� A rise in anxiety diagnoses and subsequent health benefit utilization.
� An uptick in both short-term and long-term disability claims.
For businesses, the impacts are equally detrimental, including:
� A significant drop in productivity.
� A heightened risk of administrative errors.
� Deterioration in communication and customer service quality.
� Widespread employee disengagement.
� An increase in employee turnover rates.
Implementation 
Organizations of varying sizes have a multitude of options when it comes to supporting their employees' financial health. Depending on the depth of engagement desired, here are several strategies:
� Maximizing existing benefits.
� Promoting financial literacy.
� Enlisting external experts.
� Utilizing in-house financial experts.
In all of these approaches, the key is to provide accessible, relevant and continuous support. By offering these resources, organizations not only aid their employees in achieving personal financial stability but also contribute to a more focused, productive and loyal workforce.
Outcomes
Successfully integrating financial wellness services hinges on the visibility and accessibility of the services. Actively promoting the use of these services and strategically scheduling advisor sessions can significantly enhance the program�s effectiveness. Aligning financial consultations with performance reviews or before traditionally stressful financial periods like holidays or summer vacation can help employees budget more effectively and alleviate financial strain. Introducing financial advisory services as part of the orientation process encourages new employees to establish a solid financial foundation early on.
If your organization does not currently have a financial advisor, thorough research is essential to ensure their services align with employee needs. Consider advisors who offer flexibility in meeting arrangements such as both in-office visits and virtual consultations through platforms like Zoom, to accommodate both on-site and remote employees.
For larger organizations, consider implementing financial wellness programs like savings matching, debt repayment assistance and raise deferrals into savings accounts. These initiatives can particularly benefit employees who find self-managed savings challenging by automatically deducting portions of their salary into designated accounts (savings, debt, RRSP, RESP, etc.). Such programs not only help employees build financial security but also enhance loyalty and retention by directly addressing a common source of stress.
Out-Of-The-Box Thinking For Financial Wellness
For organizations looking to be pioneers and trailblazers in employee support, here are some out-of-the-box yet impactful strategies.
Reevaluate your rewards strategy: Instead of traditional salary increases, establish a way in which to foster financial stability among employees. This can start as early as the interview process by understanding potential hires� financial goals. Upon employment, facilitate sessions with financial advisors to create personalized plans that align with their goals. This approach not only aids in financial planning but also demonstrates a deep commitment to employee well-being. When they start, you can have them sit down with advisors to assist in setting up a plan for how to achieve their goals.
Consider offering a range of benefits that address the diverse needs of your workforce. These might include:
� Child care assistance.
� Flexible work schedules.
� Mortgage and rent assistance.
� Student loan assistance.
� Educational assistance.
By 2026, Forbes predicts over 50% of employers will offer some form of financial assistance, while 40% will provide mechanisms for emergency savings. Positioning your organization at the forefront of this trend not only sets you apart as an employer of choice but also significantly contributes to a more stable and content workforce.
Conclusion
Every employee carries unique financial aspirations, be it saving for retirement, purchasing a home or eliminating debt. Organizations that proactively assist in realizing these goals stand to benefit through enhanced loyalty, productivity and retention, ultimately leading to substantial cost savings.
The recent surge in mental health issues underscores the necessity of addressing financial well-being as a fundamental aspect of overall health. The stress induced by financial uncertainty has been particularly acute in recent years, exacerbated by the global upheaval caused by the pandemic. By providing the necessary tools and support for financial stability, organizations can uplift their employees and contribute positively to the broader economy.
Embracing the wisdom of companies like WestJet, which famously noted, ""When you take care of your employees, they take care of you,"" underscores the reciprocal benefits of employee well-being initiatives. Investing in your employees� financial health is not just a moral imperative; it�s a strategic business decision that fosters a thriving and dedicated workforce.

In just a decade and a half, bitcoin has transformed from an experimental digital currency to a global asset, outperforming traditional assets. Its adoption rate, accelerating nearly twice as fast as the internet's, is a remarkable shift in mainstream finance.

Happy 15th Birthday to the Bitcoin Genesis Block featuring the headline 'The Times 03/Jan/2009 ... [+] Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,' This image symbolizes the foundational moment of Bitcoin, marking its inception and the context of its creation during financial instability.Satoshi
As bitcoin continues to revolutionize finance, businesses are adopting a bitcoin standard. MicroStrategy leads the charge, with its strategic mastermind, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, at the helm.


Their bold move into bitcoin has paid off and set a precedent, with a staggering $2 billion in returns. This is a clear signal to the business world: as we approach a bitcoin bull run. The transformative power of bitcoin is not just a future promise�it's today's reality, reshaping how companies operate and strategize in a digital economy.

This firm has integrated bitcoin as a critical component of its reserve assets. The bold move has resulted in substantial profits and enhanced their decision-making processes, reflecting a significant shift in corporate asset management strategies. MicroStrategy's success story, rooted in a long-term commitment to bitcoin, is a benchmark for other enterprises exploring similar paths.

 Bitcoin And Ether Gains
Real Bedford: Kicking Off A Bitcoin Revolution in Football
Real Bedford, excelling in both the Men's and Ladies' Leagues, is more than just a football club; it's a leader in integrating bitcoin into its core operations. Their strategy of utilizing bitcoin for sponsorships and fan engagement has established them as a unique 'bitcoin team' in football and a catalyst for a broader bitcoin-centric economic plan for the English market town of Bedford.

This initiative, injecting new life and financial vitality into the often-overlooked town, is the brainchild of Peter McCormack from the �What Bitcoin Did� podcast. McCormack suggests that all businesses should view bitcoin as a 'cheat code' for unlocking new customer bases. Real Bedford's success is a testament to how sports, intertwined with bitcoin, can play an important role in revitalizing local economies and communities.


By cautiously managing their exposure, Real Bedford allocates a small portion of their turnover to bitcoin, striking a balance between potential gains and risk minimization.This approach is similar to a strategic game where every move is calculated for long-term success.

The team is not just playing the game on the field; they're also modernizing the football business. By integrating bitcoin into their business model, they've unlocked new financial opportunities crucial for their ambition to climb the football league ladder. This approach focuses on securing sponsorships related to bitcoin, boosting fan involvement by appealing to bitcoiners, and establishing a distinctive 'bitcoin team' identity.
CoinCorner: Playing a Strategic Game in the Isle of Man
 CoinCorner, an exchange and financial services company, is steered by Danny Scott as its co-founder and CEO. While concerns about bitcoin bans are prevalent worldwide, CoinCorner remains steadfast, thanks to its strategic location in the Isle of Man, UK. This advantageous positioning gives them a strong defence against fluctuating regulations and allows them to concentrate on their core business. Their business model demonstrates how an enterprise can survive under the regulatory scrutiny of an emerging asset class.

Since 2014, CoinCorner's decision to hold bitcoin on its balance sheet has been pivotal. This approach maintains its focus on bitcoin, steering clear of other cryptocurrencies and ensuring decisions resonate with their strong bitcoin ethos.
The company has established strong banking relationships and structured its business to pre-empt future regulations like the MiCA framework. There are concerns around regulation, which it is forcing smaller entities out of business and leading to concerns of a wave of industry consolidation and the loss of independent companies.
CoinCorner stays ahead by identifying key trends, such as the increasing use of bitcoin for cross-border business payments. They also focus on improving user bitcoin accessibility, leveraging AI to enhance internal efficiencies � a testament to their commitment to continuous innovation.
Coach Carbon Life: Health And Wealth With Bitcoin Principles
Coach Carbon Life, focusing on integrating bitcoin principles into health, wealth, and life, is led by Josias Carbon. Leveraging CoinCorner's versatile business account services, the company handles both fiat and bitcoin payments. This is made possible through the efficiency of CoinCorner's mobile checkout app and its integrated online payment systems, embodying a seamless blend of financial innovation and wellness services.
At the heart of Coach Carbon philosophy is understanding time preference, delayed gratification, and personal responsibility, concepts deeply rooted in bitcoin's culture. The ability to convert fiat sales and process bitcoin transactions is crucial to their financial strategy. This capability enables them to operate a dynamic business, adapting to the needs and preferences of their clientele.
Incorporating bitcoin fundamentals into its business model mirrors these bitcoin businesses' strategic and forward-thinking practices. This synergy bolsters operational efficiency and positions them at the forefront of embracing a global currency within health and wellness services.

Solidi: Establishing Solid Ground
Under CEO Jamie McNaught's leadership, Solidi steps into the spotlight as a UK FCA-regulated exchange, showcasing the importance of regulatory compliance in bitcoin trading. Their approach underscores the necessity of trust and security in digital currency transactions, setting a benchmark for future businesses.
With its unwavering commitment to the UK market, this company is uniquely positioned with an advantageous relationship with regulatory authorities. This rapport, born from an in-depth understanding of regulatory frameworks, empowers them to offer services that set them apart from other exchanges. Their ability to onboard clients without stringent ID requirements is a testament to their regulatory expertise and the trust they have established with the authorities. This proven relationship underscores Solidi's position as a leading, compliant, and innovative player in the UK.
Compliance and regulation in the UK might seem dry, but they're crucial. Solidi understands this and has forged a trustworthy platform amid regulatory challenges. They adhere to the highest compliance standards, earning them a reputation as a reliable and regulated destination for secure bitcoin trading in the UK.
New Financial Accounting Standards Board Rules For Bitcoin
 New FASB rules mark a significant shift for bitcoin businesses. Previously, companies had to record bitcoin at the lowest price since buying it. Now, they can value it at its current market price. This change allows businesses like Real Bedford, CoinCorner, and Solidi to accurately report bitcoin's gains and losses. This move reflects bitcoin's growing acceptance in industry, encouraging more companies to adopt it.
Setting the Stage for Future Innovators
These companies represent more than just businesses adapting to the world of bitcoin; they are the front-runners of a broader movement. They demonstrate that bitcoin can be integrated into diverse business models, from sports to financial services. Their experiences offer valuable insights into embracing the potential for digital currencies and their hurdles.
These pathfinders are reshaping their sectors and laying the groundwork for future enterprises to explore bitcoin's possibilities. Their blend of innovation and strategic foresight is a blueprint for success. On the 15th anniversary of Bitcoin's Genesis Block, we see a reflection of its innovative essence in these leading companies, guiding the way for the next generation.
Similar to the impressive gains seen by MicroStrategy, companies like Real Bedford, CoinCorner, Coach Carbon Life, and Solidi demonstrate the transformative impact of integrating bitcoin with a practical and forward-thinking approach. As they continue to navigate, they pave the way for a new generation of businesses ready to harness the power and potential of bitcoin."
Business,200,"AI Will Transform Finance, But Not With Personalized Card Offers",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2024/02/22/ai-will-transform-finance-but-not-with-personalised-card-offers/,"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d728ec8c836a16d40b9391/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3600,2025,x0,y186,safe&width=440",22-02-24,"It is the customers� use of AI that will take the sector in some unexpected directions, not the banks� use of AI to make marginal improvements to existing processes.","AI Will Transform Finance, But Not With Personalized Card Offers","Armed security personnel stand guard on the rooftop of a hotel, next to letters reading ""Davos"" ... [+] surrounded by snow, near the Congress Centre on January 25, 2018 in Davos, eastern Switzerland.  
If you read any business or finance news, you would have found it impossible not to notice that there was another Davos last month. I rather agree with Andrew Curry, who says that the worst thing about the event is the temptation to take it seriously, but business leaders do turn up there to make speeches and it can be useful to listen to them to spot key themes. This year, as would expect, artificial intelligence (AI) was centre stage.


AI Is The Future of Fintech
Bryan Zhang (the executive director and co-founder of the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance at The University of Cambridge Judge Business School) presented the results of their research on the future of global fintech. The study gathered data from 227 fintechs across five verticals (digital lending, digital capital raising, digital payments, digital banking & savings and insurtech) across the Asia-Pacific, European, Latin America and Caribbean, Middle East & North African, North American and Sub-Saharan African regions. Almost three-quarters of those surveyed identified AI as the most important factor in the development of fintech in the next five years (and almost half of them pointed to embedded finance, open banking and the digital economy as the second most important factors).

I think these findings are uncontroversial. We can all agree that the fintech sector is poised to be significantly transformed by advances in artificial intelligence (AI) across a number of areas. But how, exactly? And where will the biggest impact be? Scanning through various reports, news feeds and post I can see a number of key business functions that will be affected. Here are a few of them:


Personalized Banking and Services: One of first and most obvious uses of AI, building on the masses of historical data available to banks, will be to push much more personalized products and services to customers. AI can help banks and their fintech competitors to create tailored offerings for each individual, ranging from from customized credit cards to unique savings plans;

Regulatory Compliance (RegTech): AI will help in the development of systems that can automatically adapt to new regulations and ensure compliance more efficiently. In my view, the next really big fintech businesses will actually be regtech businesses and AI is certain to power them;

Enhancing Robotic Process Automation (RPA): In their book �The Future of Finance�, Henri Arslanian and Fabrice Fisher pointed out that while automation can be enabled with relatively unsophisticated RPA technology, for more complex processes with more varied inputs, more sophisticated techniques are needed. Thus AI, combined with RPA, will result in cost savings and increased efficiency for financial institutions;

Credit Decisions and Risk Management: AI systems will help financial institutions make better lending decisions and manage risk more effectively. As a result, the market is moving towards insights-driven lending rather than expert judgement, which helps maximise rejection of high-risks customers and minimise rejection of creditworthy customers;


Investment and Trading: Mihir Desai, a Professor of Finance at Harvard Business School, points at two significant disruptions: the rise of passive fund managers and the growing dominance of quantitative investing because of the ability to analyze large amounts of data quickly. He thinks that these trends in finance suggests that an AI-dominated future can create �outsized� winners and losers pretty quickly;
Customer Support and Chatbots: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants will become more nuanced and capable of handling complex customer service inquiries, providing instant support and freeing up human resources for more strategic tasks. Personally, I am interacting with a bank chatbot, I don�t really care whether it is a person or not provided it does what I want; and
Fraud Detection and Security: I think this area is particularly concerning, because of the tidal wave of fraud that AI will unleash and the corresponding fintech opportunities to harness AI to get us to higher ground, as discussed in the recent U.S. Financial Services Committee hearing about the opportunities and risks associated with AI.The art of the new deal.� HELEN HOLMES (2024).
All of these uses of AI are, frankly, pretty unremarkable. But I think what a lot of this kind of analysis lacks is a recognition of the fact that it is the customers� use of AI that will take the sector in some unexpected directions, not the banks� use of AI. As I have written here before, financial services organisations need to pay strategic attention to the impending switch from human to machine customers.
Persuade My Bot!
The brilliant Cathy Hackl wrote about this a few years ago, noting that traditional marketing is all about the consumer, so marketers spend their effort of creating compelling narratives to connect with those consumers.

Maserati is a Stellantis brand. 
Investors in multi-car brand giant Stellantis are riding the crest of a wave as the share price hits new highs and profit margins remain more Porsche-like than Volkswagen.
Stellantis�s 2023 profit margin fell a bit to 12.8% from 13.4% in 2022. VW margins are close to 7%, and Porsche�s in the high teens. Stellantis reported in the middle of February that net profit rose 11% last year to �18.6 billion ($20.1 billion) and sales increased 6% to �190 billion ($206 billion). That propelled the shares to a new 12-month high of just over �24.

The shares have risen from a low of just over �14 last May to a new peak of �21.50 in December followed by a pause for consolidation, then on to a new closing high Thursday of �24.26, according to Reuters data.

The strong finances prompted enthusiasm from some analysts, but not all.

You can�t get much more ardent than �Stellantis: A New Toyota?� according to a report from investment researcher Jefferies.
Bernstein Research was more restrained, talking about solid results, but not liking what it called �vague� profit guidance, and worried about a build-up in stocks.1968 Alfa Romeo 1750 Spyder. Alfa Romeo is a Stellantis brand. �The company maintained its vague company guidance of �double-digit� adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margins and positive free cash flow, adding a �Supportive revenue backdrop�, while omitting to include its usual regional market outlook, which will show consensus upgrades,� Bernstein said in a report.

�Inventories have continued to rise since the 3rd quarter of 2023, despite U.S. strikes, which will add to investor concern over market weakness. While these remain below pre-pandemic levels, so is consumer demand escalating days of sale. Investors will remain worried that more incentives will weigh on 2024 margins,� according to Bernstein.

Jefferies said investors usually compare Stellantis with its �Detroit peers�, but Toyota might be a more appropriate benchmark given what it called the Japanese company�s comparable global presence, capital efficiency and balanced strategic thinking. There was a widening gap between Stellantis and its U.S. peers.
�Stellantis seems to have outperformed north American peers by between 4 and 5 percentage points. Sustained profits outside north America and higher EV losses at Ford and GM account for part of the difference, the latter putting Stellantis under the spotlight as it rolls out its new family of BEV-first platforms,� Jefferies said.
HSBC Global Research liked Stellantis�s cost savings record and said increasing sales are likely to be the key to earnings growth and new products should help. HSBC was also concerned about vague profit guidance.
�Since its creation, the key focus at Stellantis has been cost reduction,� HSBC said.
Stellantis was formed in 2021 by a merger of Fiat Chrysler and Groupe PSA. Its mass-market brands include Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat, Citroen, Opel and Vauxhall. Other marques include premium wannabes Alfa Romeo and DS, and the iconic Italian luxury-sports car maker Maserati. Stellantis is headquartered in the Netherlands.
�In this regard the company has far exceeded its own targets and expectations. This has made the stock a firm favorite with long-only investors. That focus on costs is not going away, but there is a limit to how much cutting can be done � especially when you already have industry-leading margins,� HSBC said.
Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares ruffled some feathers earlier this month with talk about how the electric car revolution might be a �bloodbath� for some companies, particularly those most exposed to China�s threat. In an interview with Bloomberg, he questioned Renault�s strategy, a company he used to work for, wondering if it had the scale to compete with the likes of BYD of China and Tesla. Tavares speculated that likely consolidation might include Renault seeking alliances with perhaps Chinese companies or Volkswagen.Peugeot e-3008. Peugeot is a Stellantis brand. 
Renault CEO Luca de Meo responded saying quality would defeat scale. He later suggested that for European companies to fight off the China threat, particularly for mass-market cheap cars, European carmakers should get together and form an �Airbus for Autos�. Airbus Industrie was set as a pan-European counterweight to the dominance of Boeing of the U.S. in the plane business.
Stellantis also said it had no current merger or acquisition plans after reports it wanted a merger with Renault. The reports had said France, which owns about 15% of Renault and 6% of Stellantis, was studying a merger plan."
Business,202,Best Practices For Scaling Your Business,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/03/01/best-practices-for-scaling-your-business/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/61313dab411ad5a74a09b482/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,23-02-24,"Your why will keep you and your team going so that you can have the kind of impact you�ve always dreamed about. In the end, scaling is worth the hard work.",Best Practices For Scaling Your Business,"If you�re an entrepreneur, chances are you�ve considered scaling your business for various reasons. It might be for the continued growth of your company and brand, or maybe it�s a part of your exit strategy. Whatever your reasoning may be, scaling can take your business to new heights�but to get the benefits, you need to execute it well.

Over the past several years, I�ve scaled my childcare center business to multiple locations while also launching four other organizations along the way. Needless to say, I�ve learned some valuable lessons through it all�ones I wish someone else would�ve shared with me. I hope this insight helps you to scale with fewer headaches than I had!


1. Get Your Leadership Team On Board
Before scaling your business, you should get clarity on your vision and share it over and over and over again with your team. It�s vital to understand the why behind wanting to scale. In other words, what�s your motivation for scaling? The answer to that question will help you navigate other key questions, such as how you want to scale and what value you want to add by scaling.

Casting the vision, and getting your team on board with the why, how and what is of utmost importance. It�s been said that when you get tired of repeating the vision, your team is just starting to hear it (or maybe just starting to take it to heart)! They need to be fans of the expansion and have clarity on direction so everyone can move forward together. Unity amongst your leadership is a must to successfully scale.
 
2. Keep A Pulse On Your Company�s Culture
Culture is paramount in companies, and a healthy culture is the foundation that will help you successfully scale. If your original site has a negative culture, it can seep into your new locations. And surprisingly enough, a healthy culture isn�t necessarily transferable from one location to another, as I quickly discovered when scaling my first time around.

Just like repeating the vision to your team is vital, keeping a pulse on the status of your culture is of equal importance. A unified team will hold the same values, thus embracing the importance of a healthy culture. However, through the process of scaling, a variety of emotions can derail your team before your very eyes. New responsibilities exist amongst your direct reports that can breed anxiety, stress, frustration and the like. I cannot stress how important it is to consistently evaluate the morale of your people as you go through this growth process. Remember, you can�t successfully scale your company alone. You need your team to be operating at their highest capacity�with a healthy approach.


Your leaders and other team members need to have good communication with each other. There should be transparency and accountability. Team members should be building each other up, not tearing each other down. If you notice any issues with your company�s culture, address and correct them before scaling because no one wants to duplicate a negative culture!
3. Don�t Assume What Has Always Worked, Will Always Work
When I started scaling my business, I thought what was working at our original site would work at our new ones. I was expecting that there would be little tweaks here and there. But I quickly realized that the adjustment was going to take more than I anticipated.
The reality is that your original site has a unique blend of factors�such as team members, customer base and location. Chances are, the processes and systems you put in place at that site work well because of those factors. A new site brings new circumstances, and the same processes and systems aren�t guaranteed to work out. Before you scale, evaluate your existing procedures to understand how they currently operate�their strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement. Identify any dependencies or potential roadblocks that could impact the transition process. It�s important to pinpoint the pain points or limitations of your current systems and processes early on and highlight the potential benefits of new ones.
Before fully implementing new systems and processes, conduct thorough testing to ensure they function as expected and meet your requirements. This may involve testing in a controlled environment or running pilot programs to validate the changes. The first time I scaled would have been a much smoother transition if I had done this prior to the expansion. Instead, I had to quickly change my approach. I had to readjust and implement for months after opening our second location. It was a nightmare and cost us team morale and business growth in the first few months of operation. By getting ahead of things by implementing strategies and structures long before you scale, you�ll have an easier time.
4. Strike A Balance Between Uniformity And Variation
As you discover which systems and processes are and aren�t working, you�ll likely make some changes. But you don�t have to apply every change to every location. As you scale, you should strike a balance between uniformity and variation.
For instance, as my company scaled, my team and I created a color-coded campus management system. Items marked red are nonnegotiable; every campus has to follow those procedures. Items marked yellow are negotiable; the leadership team has some leeway in how they approach those procedures. Items marked green are in the purview of the leadership at each location�it�s up to them to decide how they want to handle those situations. By balancing uniformity and variation, we�ve ensured that every school isn�t a free-for-all and that there is consistency between locations while not micromanaging things.
5. Be Mindful Of Internal Competition
When business leaders think of competition, they might be more likely to consider external competition�competing companies. But when you scale, you also have to consider internal competition. Your new locations might start competing with your original one�and with each other.
Internal competition wasn�t something I was anticipating when I scaled. But eventually, I realized that some of my leadership team felt like they were in competition with one another instead of being one-minded as part of a single company. To turn things around, I started emphasizing our culture more and rotated leadership to different locations so they could see the entirety of our corporate vision. If you notice internal competition bubbling up, I recommend implementing similar strategies�it�s imperative that you remind your team that they�re working for one company toward common goals in order to have the greatest impact. When your different locations work in harmony with each other rather than in competition, you�ll ultimately see the many benefits of scaling, including the value added to your team and customer base.
Scaling to two or more locations is a large undertaking. It�ll require a lot of money, time, effort and energy. It will be challenging at times. But throughout the process, don�t forget your why. Reflect on it during the hard times when you face unforeseen obstacles or are just flat-out exhausted. Your why will keep you and your team going so that you can have the kind of impact you�ve always dreamed about. In the end, scaling is worth the hard work.

Business,203,DHL Is Going Into The Resale Business,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2024/02/28/dhl-is-going-into-the-resale-business/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65dcedc7b9192017b65e1bc1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,28-02-24,"DHL's fascinating announcement implies that it isn't always necessary to raise billions to build the resale industry, existing resources can often be leveraged.",DHL Is Going Into The Resale Business,"Giant delivery company DHL now wants to grow with the resale business. 
DHL announced today that it entered into a partnership with resale company Reflaunt to provide logistics services for the resale (vintage) business. Under the arrangement, brands contract with Reflaunt to manage their resale operations and all products get handled and authenticated by DHL personnel at DHL facilities.


How it works:

- Consumers go to a brand's site to and use software provided to the brand by Reflaunt which manages the process.

- The software arranges for DHL to pick up, sort, grade, authenticate, photograph, handle and ship. To consumers, it appears that they are only interacting with the brand.

- Both DHL and Reflaunt will market the service to brands.


Why This Is Important
There are many reasons why resale is a huge growth opportunity for consumer products:
- It allows consumerss to access brands they couldn't otherwise afford.
- It makes purchases of new products cheaper because part of the purchase price is recoverable.
- It is better for the environment, creates less waste and extends the life of products that would otherwise sit unused or go to landfill.
For all those reasons and others, consumers want it.

But there are problems with the resale business. Most notably, it's super hard to make money. Billions have been invested and lost trying to build resale businesses at a large scale.
Some of the reasons why it's so hard are:


- There's a limit to what resold products can be sold for because they always have to be less than new products.
- Resold products have higher costs of handling, inspection and authentication than new products because every item is unique and arrives one-by-one instead of by the thousands. Some are fake and have to be individually weeded out.
- Resold products have to be coaxed from consumers' closets individually whereas new products can be ordered, made and shipped by the pallet.
While we are beginning to see signs of profitability in resale (see this article), the infrastructure to make the industry efficient is only now beginning to appear. Until not long ago, it was thought of as clothes for poor people. Now thinking is changing.
That a company the size of DHL believes this is an opportunity is a significant change. Contrary to what investors thought when they put billions into big resale platforms like The RealReal and ThredUp, a lot of the infrastructure for resale doesn�t have to be purpose-built; it can be tacked on to existing operations and that's what DHL is doing.
DHL is not the only one. A company called Open For Vintage is taking the information from brick-and-mortar vintage boutiques worldwide and posting the products on e-marketplaces to expose it to consumers worldwide. It�s another example of leveraging existing infrastructure instead of investing billions to build it new. The efficiency of the approach makes it likely we will see more such developments over time.
This trend will lead to a time where you'll be able to scan your closet with your mobile device, decide what you want to sell and it will get posted online immediately. That kind of change is a long way off but it's coming. The commitment of a company the size of DHL is one of the signs that resale can be made more efficient by implementing existing resources to drive profitability in resale. More ways will have to be found to realize the enormous potential of resale because that�s what consumers want."
Business,204,How To Create Meaning In Business,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/02/28/how-to-create-meaning-in-business/,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6311ff9183979c27434fdbb8/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=440,28-02-24,"Establishing meaning can yield numerous benefits for leaders and employees, centering operations and goals on a healthier internal culture.",How To Create Meaning In Business,"Many business-savvy professionals will tell you that business revolves solely around various measurements of success. Those metrics and performance indicators are generally synonymous with lasting performance, viability and revenue accrual. However, this long-standing viewpoint�while inherently true on several fronts�is no longer the end-all and be-all of a business�s identity. Today�s most successful executive leaders recognize a crucial second focal point within their daily obligations: Creating meaning and a sense of worth and purpose.

Establishing meaning can yield numerous benefits for leaders and employees, centering operations and goals on a healthier internal culture. You may find success in this approach by considering the following steps:


Start With Foundational Elements
To properly foster a stronger sense of meaning and purpose-driven growth within your business, you must first provide an appropriate foundation atop which your employees can develop in this manner. Start by adjusting (or flat-out removing) the standing elements, methods and ideologies that are incompatible with a value-oriented framework.

For instance, if a typical day in the office involves excessive administrative busywork and meetings rife with top-down orders from leadership, explore ways to streamline such obligations and add variety while communicating a clearly defined purpose. This approach will get you into a habit of never settling on outdated or inappropriate norms, allowing you to better define value and focus on necessary changes benefitting your employees.
The foundational stage also entails looking inward and auditing yourself as a leader based on the same fields. For your company to have a defined core purpose, it must have a clear frame of reference, and you can take initiative by leading by example. Practicing what you preach can jumpstart a healthy new way of thinking and defining one�s work, which is often contagious and conducive to improved professional worth.

Create New Internal Opportunities
The natural next step is to get your employees involved in your ideological transition early and often. Strive to empower workers where they may otherwise feel absent or unheard, encouraging autonomy and participation in projects, meetings and potential outlets for solution ideation. Such a culture is mutually beneficial for leaders and employees; it helps leaders get into a more worker-oriented corporate routine while opening a transparent internal dialogue for employees�all of which bolsters value by linking it to mutual understanding and respect.


You may, for example, establish more pathways for ongoing development and training, implement a more open-forum method in team meetings and high-level discussions or create additional opportunities for employee recognition and motivation. These measures reflect an inherent desire to unroot antiquated, unhelpful parts of office culture and replace them with ones rooted in employee enrichment and support.
Stay Consistent
No matter which value-building method works for your business, it is important to make it a steadfast part of everyday life in the office. These changes should not be fleeting or performative and should certainly not come with ulterior motives tied to performance and goal achievement alone. Those factors remain a key part of business viability, but they should go hand in hand with an overarching sense of purpose. This way, employees will feel like their work matters rather than simply seeing it as a cog in a cold, impersonal machine.
Above all, the key to business-related meaning is never to let go of it once you have established it as a cultural cornerstone; this will be paramount for ensuring the previous steps continue having an effective, enduring impact on both current and future employees.
